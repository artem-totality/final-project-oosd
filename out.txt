[???]



this tale grew in the telling [???] until it became a history of the great
war of the ring and included many [???] of the yet more ancient history
that preceded it . it was begun soon after the hobbit was written and before
its publication in [???] ; but i did not go on with this [???] [???] for i wished
first to complete and set in order the [???] and [???] of the elder
days [???] which had then been taking shape for some years . i desired to do this
for my own satisfaction [???] and i had little hope that other people would be
interested in this work [???] especially since it was primarily [???] in
[???] and was begun in order to provide the necessary background of
' history ' for elvish tongues .
when those whose advice and opinion i sought corrected little hope to
no hope [???] i went back to the [???] [???] encouraged by requests from readers for
more information concerning [???] and their adventures . but the story was
drawn [???] towards the older world [???] and became an account [???] as it
were [???] of its end and passing away before its beginning and middle had been
told . the process had begun in the writing of the hobbit [???] in which there
were already some references to the older matter : [???] [???] [???] [???] the
high - elves [???] and the [???] [???] as well as [???] that had arisen [???] of
things higher or deeper or darker than its surface : durin [???] moria [???] [???] [???]
the [???] [???] the ring . the discovery of the [???] of these
[???] and of their relation to the ancient histories revealed the third
age and its [???] in the war of the ring .
those who had asked for more information about [???] eventually got
it [???] but they had to wait a long time ; for the composition of the lord of the
rings went on at intervals during the years [???] to [???] [???] a period in which
i had many duties that i did not neglect [???] and many other interests as a
learner and teacher that often [???] me . the delay was [???] of course [???] also
increased by the [???] of war in [???] [???] by the end of which year the tale
had not yet reached the end of book one . in spite of the darkness of the
next five years i found that the story could not now be wholly abandoned [???]
and i [???] on [???] mostly by night [???] till i stood by balin ' s tomb in moria .
there i halted for a long while . it was almost a year later when i went on
and so came to [???] and the great river late in [???] . in the next year

i wrote the first [???] of the matter that now stands as book three [???] and
the beginnings of chapters i and iii of book five ; and there as the [???]
flared in [???] and [???] came to [???] i stopped . foresight had
failed and there was no time for thought .
it was during [???] that [???] leaving the loose ends and perplexities of a
war which it was my task to conduct [???] or at least to report [???] 1 forced myself
to tackle the journey of [???] to [???] . these chapters [???] eventually to
become book four [???] were written and sent out as a serial to my son [???]
[???] [???] then in south africa with the raf . nonetheless it took another
five years before the tale was brought to its present end ; in that time i
changed my house [???] my chair [???] and my [???] [???] and the days though less dark
were no less [???] . then when the ' end ' had at last been reached the
whole story had to be revised [???] and indeed largely re - written backwards . and
it had to be typed [???] and re - typed : by me ; the cost of professional typing by
the ten - fingered was beyond my means .
the lord of the rings has been read by many people since it finally
appeared in print ; and i should like to say something here with reference to
the many opinions or guesses that i have received or have read concerning
the motives and meaning of the tale . the prime motive was the desire of a
tale - teller to try his hand at a really long story that would hold the
attention of readers [???] amuse them [???] delight them [???] and at times maybe excite
them or deeply move them . as a guide i had only my own feelings for what is
appealing or moving [???] and for many the guide was [???] often at fault .
some who have read the book [???] or at any rate have [???] it [???] have found it
boring [???] absurd [???] or contemptible ; and i have no cause to complain [???] since i
have similar opinions of their works [???] or of the kinds of writing that they
evidently prefer . but even from the points of view of many who have enjoyed
my story there is much that fails to please . it is perhaps not possible in a
long tale to please everybody at all points [???] nor to displease everybody at
the same points ; for i find from the letters that i have received that the
passages or chapters that are to some a blemish are all by others specially
approved . the most [???] reader of all [???] myself [???] now finds many defects [???]
minor and major [???] but being fortunately under no obligation either to review
the book or to write it again [???] he will pass over these in silence [???] except
one that has been noted by others : the book is too short .
as for any inner meaning or ' message ' [???] it has in the intention of the
author none . it is neither [???] nor topical . as the story grew it put

down roots ( into the past ) and threw out unexpected branches : but its main
theme was settled from the outset by the [???] choice of the ring as
the link between it and the hobbit . the [???] chapter [???] [???] the shadow of the
past ' [???] is one of the oldest parts of the tale . it was written long before
the [???] of [???] had yet become a threat of [???] disaster [???] and
from that point the story would have developed along essentially the same
lines [???] if that disaster had been averted . its sources are things long before
in mind [???] or in some cases already written [???] and little or nothing in it was
modified by the war that began in [???] or its [???] .
the real war does not resemble the [???] war in its process or its
conclusion . if it had [???] or directed the development of the legend [???]
then certainly the ring would have been seized and used against [???] ; he
would not have been [???] but [???] [???] and barad - dyr would not have
been destroyed but occupied . [???] [???] failing to get possession of the ring [???]
would m the confusion and [???] of the time have found in [???] the
missing links in his own [???] into ring - lore [???] and before long he would
have made a great ring of his own with which to challenge the self - styled
ruler of middle - earth . in that conflict both sides would have held [???]
in hatred and contempt : they would not long have survived even as slaves .
other arrangements could be devised according to the tastes or views of
those who like allegory or topical reference . but i cordially dislike
allegory in all its manifestations [???] and always have done so since i grew old
and wary enough to detect its presence . i much prefer history [???] true or
feigned [???] with its varied [???] to the thought and experience of
readers . i think that many confuse ' [???] ' with ' allegory ' ; but the
one resides in the freedom of the reader [???] and the other in the purposed
domination of the author .
an author cannot of course remain wholly [???] by his experience [???]
but the ways in which a story - germ uses the soil of experience are extremely
complex [???] and attempts to define the process are at best guesses from
evidence that is [???] and [???] . it is also false [???] though
naturally attractive [???] when the lives of an author and [???] have
[???] [???] to suppose that the movements of thought or the events of times
common to both were necessarily the most powerful influences . one has
indeed
personally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression ; but
as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught in youth

by [???] was no less hideous an experience than to be involved in [???] and
the following years . by [???] all but one of my close friends were dead . or
to take a less grievous matter : it has been supposed by some that ' the
scouring of the shire ' reflects the situation in england at the time when i
was finishing my tale . it does not . it is an essential part of the plot [???]
foreseen from the outset [???] though in the event modified by the character of
[???] as developed in the story without [???] need i say [???] any [???]
[???] or [???] political reference whatsoever . it has indeed
some basis in experience [???] though slender ( for the economic situation was
entirely different ) [???] and much further back . the country in which i lived in
childhood was being [???] destroyed before i was ten [???] in days when
motor - cars were rare objects ( i had never seen one ) and men wer e still
building [???] railways . recently i saw in a paper a picture of the last
[???] of the once thriving corn - mill beside its pool that long ago
seemed to me so important . i never liked the looks of the young miller [???] but
his father [???] the old miller [???] had a black beard [???] and he was not named
sandyman .
the lord of the rings is now issued in a new edition [???] and the
opportunity has been taken of revising it . a number of errors and
[???] that still rema ined in the text have been corrected [???] and an
attempt has been made to provide information on a few points which attentive
readers have raised . i have considered all their comments and [???] [???] and
if some seem to have been passed over that may be because i have failed to
keep my notes in order ; but many [???] could only be answered by
additional [???] [???] or indeed by the production of an accessory volume
containing much of the material that i did not include in the original
edition [???] in particular more detailed [???] information . in the meantime
this edition offers this [???] [???] an addition to the prologue [???] some notes [???]
and an index of the names of persons and places . this index is in intention
complete in items but not in references [???] since for the present purpose it
has been necessary to reduce its bulk . a complete index [???] making full use of
the material prepared for me by mrs . n . smith [???] belongs rather to the
accessory volume .


* prologue *




1 . concerning [???]



this book is largely concerned with [???] [???] and from its pages a
reader may discover much of their character and a little of their history .
further information will also be found in the selection from the red book of
[???] that has already been published [???] under the title of the hobbit .
that story was derived from the earlier chapters of the red book [???] composed
by [???] himself [???] the first hobbit to become famous in the world at large [???]
and called by him there and back again [???] since they told of his journey into
the east and his return : an adventure which later involved all the [???]
in the great events of that age that are here related .
many [???] however [???] may wish to know more about this remarkable people
from
the outset [???] whi le some may not possess the earlier book . for such readers a
few notes on the more important points are here collected from hobbit - lore [???]
and the first adventure is briefly recalled .
[???] are an [???] but very ancient people [???] more [???]
formerly than they are today ; for they love peace and quiet and good tilled
earth : a well - ordered and well - farmed countryside was their favourite haunt .
they do not and did not understand or like machines more [???] than a
forge - bellows [???] a water - mill [???] or a hand - loom [???] though they were skilful with
tools . even in ancient days they were [???] as a rule [???] shy of ' the big folk ' [???] as
they call us [???] and now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to
find . they are quick of hearing and sharp - eyed [???] and though they are inclined
to be fat and do not hurry [???] [???] they are nonetheless nimble and
deft in their movements . they possessed from the first the art of
disappearing swiftly and silently [???] when large folk whom they do not wish to
meet come [???] by ; and this an they have developed until to men it may
seem magical . but [???] have never [???] in fact [???] studied magic of any kind [???]
and their [???] is due solely to a professional skill that [???]
and practice [???] and a close friendship with the earth [???] have rendered

[???] by bigger and [???] races .
for they are a little people [???] smaller than [???] : less tout and
stocky [???] that is [???] even when they are not actually much shorter . their height
is variable [???] ranging between two and four feet of our measure . they seldom
now reach three feet ; but they hive [???] [???] they say [???] and in ancient days
they were taller . according to the red book [???] [???] took ( [???] ) [???]
son of [???] the second [???] was four foot five and able to ride a horse . he
was [???] in all hobbit records only by two famous characters of old ;
but that curious matter is dealt with in this book .
as for the [???] of the shire [???] with whom these tales are concerned [???]
in the days of their peace and prosperity they were a merry folk . they
dressed in bright colours [???] being notably fond of yellow and green ; but they
seldom wore shoes [???] since their feet had tough leathery soles and were clad
in a thick curling hair [???] much like the hair of their heads [???] which was
commonly brown . thus [???] the only craft little practised among them was
shoe - making ; but they had long and skilful fingers and could make many other
useful and comely things . their faces were as a rule good - natured rather
than beautiful [???] broad [???] bright - eyed [???] red - cheeked [???] with mouths apt to
laughter [???] and to eating and drinking . and laugh they did [???] and eat [???] and
drink [???] often and heartily [???] being fond of simple jests at all times [???] and of
six meals a day ( when they could get them ) . they were [???] and
delighted in parties [???] and in presents [???] which they gave away freely and
eagerly accepted .
it is plain indeed that in spite of later [???] [???] are
[???] of ours : far nearer to us than elves [???] or even than [???] . of old
they spoke the languages of men [???] after their own fashion [???] and liked and
disliked much the same things as men did . but what exactly our relationship
is can no longer be discovered . the beginning of [???] lies far back in
the elder days that are now lost and forgotten . only the elves still
preserve any records of that vanished time [???] and their traditions are
concerned almost entirely with their own history [???] in which men appear seldom
and [???] are not mentioned at all . yet it is clear that [???] had [???] in
fact [???] lived quietly in middle - earth for many long years before other folk
became even aware of them . and the world being after all full of strange
creatures beyond count [???] these little people seemed of very little
importance . but in the days of [???] [???] and of [???] his heir [???] they suddenly
became [???] by no wish of their own [???] both important and renowned [???] and troubled

the counsels of the wise and the great .
those days [???] the third age of middle - earth [???] are now long past [???] and the
shape of all lands has been changed ; but the regions in which [???] then
lived were doubtless the same as those in which they still linger : the
north - west of the old world [???] east of the sea . of their original home the
[???] in [???] ' s time preserved no knowledge . a love of learning ( other
than [???] lore ) was far from general among them [???] but there remained
still a few in the older [???] who studied their own books [???] and even
gathered reports of old times and distant lands from elves [???] [???] [???] and
men . their own records began only after the settlement of the shire [???] and
their most ancient [???] hardly looked further back than their wandering
days . it is clear [???] nonetheless [???] from these [???] [???] and from the evidence of
their peculiar words and customs [???] that like many other folk [???] had in
the distant past moved westward . their earliest tales seem to glimpse a time
when they dwelt in the upper vales of [???] [???] between the eaves of
[???]
the great and the misty mountains . why they later undertook the hard and
perilous crossing of the mountains into [???] is no longer certain . their
own accounts speak of the [???] of men in the land [???] and of a shadow
that fell on the forest [???] so that it became darkened and its new name was
[???] .
before the crossing of the mountains the [???] had already become
divided into three somewhat different breeds : [???] [???] stoors [???] and
[???] . the [???] were browner of skin [???] smaller [???] and shorter [???] and
they were beardless and bootless ; their hands and feet were neat and nimble ;
and they preferred [???] and hillsides . the stoors were broader [???] heavier
in build ; their feet and hands were larger [???] and they preferred flat lands
and riversides . the [???] were fairer of skin and also of hair [???] and
they were taller and [???] than the others ; they were lovers of trees and
of [???] .
the [???] had much to do with [???] in ancient times [???] and long
lived in the [???] of the mountains . they moved westward early [???] and
roamed over [???] as far as [???] while the others were still in the
wilderland . they were the most normal and representative variety of hobbit [???]
and far the most [???] . they were the most inclined to settle in one
place [???] and longest preserved their ancestral habit of living in [???] and
holes .

the stoors lingered long by the banks of the great river [???] [???] and
were less shy of men . they came west after the [???] and followed the
course of the loudwater southwards ; and there many of them long dwelt
between [???] and the borders of dunland before they moved north again .
the [???] [???] the least [???] [???] were a [???] branch . they were
more friendly with elves than the other [???] were [???] and had more skill in
language and song than in [???] ; and of old they preferred hunting to
tilling . they crossed the mountains north of [???] and came down the
river [???] . in [???] they soon mingled with the other kinds that had
preceded them [???] but being somewhat bolder and more adventurous [???] they were
often found as leaders or [???] among clans of [???] or stoors . even
in [???] ' s time the strong [???] strain could still be noted among the
greater [???] [???] such as the tooks and the masters of buckland .
in the [???] of [???] [???] between the misty mountains and the
mountains of lune [???] the [???] found both men and elves . indeed [???] a [???]
still dwelt there of the d [???] nedain [???] the kings of men that came over the sea
out of westernesse ; but they were [???] fast and the lands of their
north kingdom were falling far and wide into waste . there was room and to
spare for [???] [???] and ere long the [???] began to settle in ordered
communities . most of their earlier settlements had long disappeared and been
forgotten in [???] ' s time ; but one of the first to become important still
endured [???] though reduced in size ; this was at bree and in the [???] that
lay round about [???] some forty miles east of the shire .
it was in these early days [???] doubtless [???] that the [???] learned their
letters and began to write after the manner of the d [???] nedain [???] who had in
their turn long before learned the art from the elves . and in those days
also they forgot whatever languages they had used before [???] and spoke ever
after the common speech [???] the westron as it was named [???] that was current
through all the lands of the kings from [???] to [???] [???] and about all the
coasts of the sea from [???] to lune . yet they kept a few words of their
own [???] as well as their own names of months and days [???] and a great store of
personal names out of the past .
about this time legend among the [???] first becomes history with a
reckoning of years . for it was in the one thousand six hundred and first
year of the third age that the [???] brothers [???] marcho and [???] [???] set
out from bree ; and having obtained permission from the high king at
[???] [???] they crossed the brown river [???] with a great following of

[???] . they passed over the bridge of [???] [???] that had been built in
the days of the power of the north kingdom [???] and they took ail the land
beyond to dwell in [???] between the river and the far downs . all that was
demanded of them was that they should keep the great bridge in repair [???] and
all other bridges and roads [???] speed the king ' s messengers [???] and acknowledge
his lordship .
thus began the shire - reckoning [???] for the year of the crossing of the
[???] ( as the [???] turned the name ) became year one of the shire [???]
and all later dates were reckoned from it . 2 at once the western [???] fell
in love with their new land [???] and they remained there [???] and soon passed once
more out of the history of men and of elves . while there was still a king
they were in name his subjects [???] but they were [???] in fact [???] ruled by their own
[???] and meddled not at all with events in the world outside . to the
last battle at [???] with the witch - lord of [???] they sent some bowmen
to the aid of the king [???] or so they maintained [???] though no tales of men record
it . but in that war the north kingdom ended ; and then the [???] took the
land for their own [???] and they chose from their own chiefs a thain to hold the
authority of the king that was gone . there for a thousand years they were
little troubled by wars [???] and they prospered and [???] after the dark
plague ( s . r . 37 ) until the disaster of the long winter and the famine that
followed it . many thousands then perished [???] but the days of dearth ( [???] - 60 )
were at the time of this tale long past and the [???] had again become
accustomed to plenty . the land was rich and kindly [???] and though it had long
been deserted when they entered it [???] it had before been well tilled [???] and
there the king had once had many farms [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] and woods .
forty leagues it stretched from the far downs to the [???] bridge [???]
and fifty from the northern moors to the marshes in the south . the [???]
named it the shire [???] as the region of the authority of their thain [???] and a
[???] of well - ordered business ; and there in that pleasant comer of the
world they plied their well - ordered business of living [???] and they heeded less
and less the world outside where dark things moved [???] until they came to think
that peace and plenty were the rule in middle - earth and the right of all
sensible folk . they forgot or ignored what little they had ever known of the
guardians [???] and of the labours of those that made possible the long peace of
the shire . they were [???] in fact [???] sheltered [???] but they had ceased to remember
it .
at no time had [???] of any kind been warlike [???] and they had never

fought among themselves . in olden days they had [???] of course [???] been often
obliged to fight to maintain themselves in a hard world ; but in [???] ' s time
that was very ancient history . the last battle [???] before this story opens [???] and
indeed the only one that had ever been fought within the borders of the
shire [???] was beyond living memory : the battle of [???] [???] s . r . [???] [???] in
which [???] took routed an invasion of [???] . even the weathers had
grown
milder [???] and the wolves that had once come ravening out of the north in
bitter white winters were now only a grandfather ' s tale . so [???] though there
was still some store of weapons in the shire [???] these were used mostly as
trophies [???] hanging above hearths or on walls [???] or gathered into the museum at
michel delving . the [???] - house it was called ; for anything that [???]
had no immediate use for [???] but were unwilling to throw away [???] they called a
[???] . their dwellings were apt to become rather crowded with [???] [???]
and
many of the presents that passed from hand to hand were of that son .
nonetheless [???] ease and peace had left this people still curiously tough .
they were [???] if it came to it [???] difficult to daunt or to kill ; and they were [???]
perhaps [???] so [???] fond of good things not least because they could [???]
when put to it [???] do without them [???] and could survive rough handling by grief [???]
foe [???] or weather in a way that astonished those who did not know them well
and looked no further than their bellies and their well - fed faces . though
slow to quarrel [???] and for sport killing nothing that lived [???] they were [???]
at bay [???] and at need could still handle arms . they shot well with the bow [???]
for they were keen - eyed and sure at the mark . not only with bows and arrows .
if any hobbit stooped for a stone [???] it was well to get quickly under cover [???]
as all trespassing beasts knew very well .
all [???] had originally lived in holes in the ground [???] or so they
believed [???] and in such dwellings they still felt most at home ; but in the
course of time they had been obliged to adopt other forms of [???] . actually
in the shire in [???] ' s days it was [???] as a rule [???] only the richest and the
poorest [???] that maintained the old custom . the poorest went on living
in burrows of the most primitive kind [???] mere holes indeed [???] with only one
window or none ; while the well - to - do still [???] more [???]
versions of the simple [???] of old . but suitable sites for these large
and ramifying [???] ( or [???] as they called them ) were not everywhere to
be found ; and in the flats and the low - lying [???] the [???] [???] as they

[???] [???] began to build above ground . indeed [???] even in the hilly regions
and the older villages [???] such as [???] or [???] [???] or in the chief
township of the shire [???] michel delving on the white downs [???] there were now
many houses of wood [???] brick [???] or stone . these were specially favoured by
millers [???] smiths [???] ropers [???] and [???] [???] and others of that sort ; for even
when they had holes to live in . [???] had long been accustomed to build
sheds and [???] .
the habit of building [???] and barns was said to have begun among
the inhabitants of the marish down by the [???] . the [???] of that
quarter [???] the [???] [???] were rather large and heavy - legged [???] and they wore
dwarf - boots in muddy weather . but they were well known to be stoors in a
large part of their blood [???] as indeed was shown by the down that many grew on
their chins . no har foot or [???] had any trace of a beard . indeed [???] the
folk of the marish [???] and of buckland [???] east of the river [???] which they
afterwards occupied [???] came for the most part later into the shire up from
south - away ; and they still had many peculiar names and strange words not
found elsewhere in the shire .
it is probable that the craft of building [???] as many other crafts beside [???]
was derived from the d [???] nedain . but the [???] may have learned it direct
from the elves [???] the teachers of men in their youth . for the elves of the
high kindred had not yet forsaken middle - earth [???] and they dwelt still at that
time at the grey havens away to the west [???] and in other places within reach
of the shire . three elf - towers of [???] age were still to be seen on
the tower hills beyond the western marches . they shone far off in the
moonlight . the tallest was furthest away [???] standing alone upon a green mound .
the [???] of the [???] said that one could see the sea from the lop
of that tower ; but no hobbit had ever been known to climb it . indeed [???] few
[???] had ever seen or sailed upon the sea [???] and fewer still had ever
returned to report it . most [???] regarded even rivers and small boats
with deep [???] [???] and not many of them could swim . and as the days of
the shire lengthened they spoke less and less with the elves [???] and grew
afraid of them [???] and [???] of those that had dealings with them ; and
the sea became a word of fear among them [???] and a token of death [???] and they
turned their faces away from the hills in the west .
the craft of building may have come from elves or men [???] but the [???]
used it in their own fashion . they did not go in for towers . their houses
were usually long [???] low [???] and comfortable . the oldest kind were [???] indeed [???] no

more than built imitations of [???] [???] thatched with dry grass or straw [???] or
roofed with turves [???] and having walls somewhat bulged . that stage [???] however [???]
belonged to the early days of the shire [???] and hobbit - building had long since
been altered [???] improved by devices [???] learned from [???] [???] or discovered by
themselves . a preference for round windows [???] and even round doors [???] was the
chief remaining peculiarity of hobbit - [???] .
the houses and the holes of shire - [???] were often large [???] and
inhabited by large [???] . ( [???] and [???] [???] were as bachelors very
[???] [???] as they were also in many other ways [???] such as their friendship
with the elves . ) sometimes [???] as in the case of the tooks of great [???] [???] or
the [???] of brandy hall [???] many generations of [???] lived in
( comparative ) peace together in one ancestral and many - [???] mansion .
all [???] were [???] in any case [???] [???] and reckoned up their [???]
with great care . they drew long and [???] family - trees with [???]
branches . in dealing with [???] it is important to remember who is related
to whom [???] and in what degree . it would be impossible in this book to set out
a family - tree that included even the more important members of the more
important [???] at the time which these tales tell of . the [???]
trees at the end of the red book of [???] are a small book in
themselves [???] and all but [???] would find them exceedingly dull . [???]
delighted in such things [???] if they were accurate : they liked to have books
filled with things that they already knew [???] set out fair and square with no
contradictions .



2 . concerning pipe - weed



there is another astonishing thing about [???] of old that must be
mentioned [???] an astonishing habit : they [???] or [???] [???] through pipes of
clay or wood [???] the smoke of the burning leaves of a herb [???] which they called
pipe - weed or leaf [???] a variety probably of [???] . a great deal of mystery
surrounds the origin of this peculiar custom [???] or ' art ' as the [???]
preferred to call it . all that could be discovered about it in antiquity was
put together by [???] [???] ( later master of buckland ) [???] and since he
and the tobacco of the [???] play a part in the history that
follows [???] his remarks in the introduction to his [???] of the shire may be
quoted .
' this [???] ' he says [???] ' is the one art that we can certainly claim to be our
own invention . when hobbi ts first began to smoke is not known [???] all the
[???] and family histories take it for granted ; for ages folk in the shire
smoked various herbs [???] some fouler [???] some sweeter . but all accounts agree that
[???] [???] of [???] in the [???] first grew the true
pipe - weed in his gardens in the days of [???] the second [???] about the year
[???] of shire - reckoning . the best home - grown still comes from that [???] [???]
especially the [???] now known as [???] leaf [???] old toby [???] and
southern star .
' how old toby came by the plant is not recorded [???] for to his dying day
he would not tell . he knew much about herbs [???] but he was no traveller . it is
said that in his youth he went often to bree [???] though he certainly never went
further fr om the shire than that . it is thus quite possible that he learned
of this plant in bree [???] where now [???] at any rate [???] it grows well on the south
[???] of the hill . the bree - [???] claim to have been the first actual
smokers of the pipe - weed . they cla im [???] of course [???] to have done everything
before the people of the shire [???] whom they refer to as [???] [???] [???] ; but in
this case their claim is [???] i think [???] likely to be true . and certainly it was
from bree that the art of smoking the [???] weed [???] d in the recent
[???] among [???] and such other folk [???] rangers [???] [???] [???] or wanderers [???]
as still passed to and fro through that ancient road - meeting . the home and
centre of the an is thus to be found in the old inn of bree [???] the prancing

pony [???] that has been kept by the family of [???] from time beyond record .
' all the same [???] observations that i have made on my own many journeys
south have convinced me that the weed itself is not native to our parts of
the world [???] but came northward from the lower [???] [???] whither it was [???] i
suspect [???] originally brought over sea by the men of westernesse . it grows
abundantly in [???] [???] and there is richer and larger than in the north [???]
where it is never found wild [???] and flourishes only in warm sheltered places
like [???] . the men of [???] call it sweet [???] [???] and esteem it only
for the fragrance of its flowers . from that land it must have been carried
up the greenway during the long [???] between the coming of [???] and
our own day . but even the d [???] nedain of [???] allow us this credit : [???]
first put it into pipes . not even the [???] first thought of that before
we did . though one [???] that i knew took up the art long ago [???] and became
as skilful in it as in all other things that he put his mind to . '



3 . of the ordering of the shire



the shire was divided into four quarters [???] the farthings already
referred to . north [???] south [???] east [???] and west ; and these again each into a
number of [???] [???] which still bore the names of some of the old leading
[???] [???] although by the time of this history these names were no longer
found only in their proper [???] . nearly all tooks still lived in the
tookland [???] but that was not true of many other [???] [???] such as the
[???] or the [???] . outside the farthings were the east and west
marches : the buckland ( see beginning of chapter v [???] book i ) ; and the
[???] added to the shire in s . r . [???] .
the shire at this time had hardly any ' government ' . [???] for the
most part managed their own affairs . growing food and eating it occupied
most of their time . in other matters they were [???] as a rule [???] generous and not
greedy [???] but contented and moderate [???] so that estates [???] farms [???] [???] [???] and
small trades tended to remain unchanged for generations .
there remained [???] of course [???] the ancient tradition concerning the high
king at [???] [???] or norbury as they called it [???] away north of the shire . but
there had been no king for nearly a thousand years [???] and even the ruins of
kings ' norbury were covered with grass . yet the [???] still said of wild
folk and wicked things ( such as [???] ) that they had not heard of the king .
for they attributed to the king of old all their essential laws ; and usually
they kept the laws of free will [???] because they were the rules ( as they said ) [???]
both ancient and just .
it is true that the took family had long been pre - eminent ; for the
office of thain had passed to them ( from the [???] ) some [???]
before [???] and the chief took had borne that title ever since . the thain was
the master of the shire - moot [???] and captain of the shire - muster and the
[???] - in - arms [???] but as muster and moot were only held in times of
[???] [???] which no longer occurred [???] the [???] had ceased to be more
than a [???] dignity . the took family was still [???] indeed [???] accorded a
special respect [???] for it remained both [???] and exceedingly wealthy [???] and
was liable to produce in ever y generation strong characters of peculiar
habits and even adventurous temperament . the latter qualities [???] however [???] were

now rather tolerated ( in the rich ) than generally approved . the custom
endured [???] nonetheless [???] of referring to the head of the family as the took [???]
and of adding to his name [???] if required [???] a number : such as [???] the
second [???] for instance .
the only real official in the shire at this date was the mayor of
michel delving ( or of the shire ) [???] who was elected every seven years at the
free fair on the white downs at the lithe [???] that is at [???] . as mayor
almost his only duty was to preside at banquets [???] given on the
shire - holidays [???] which occurred at frequent intervals . but the offices of
postmaster and first [???] were attached to the mayoralty [???] so that he
managed both the messenger service and the watch . these were the only
shire - services [???] and the messengers were the most [???] [???] and much the
busier of the two . by no means a ll [???] were lettered [???] but those who were
wrote constantly to all their friends ( and a selection of their relations )
who lived further off than an afternoon ' s walk .
the [???] was the name that the [???] gave to their police [???] or
the nearest [???] that they possessed . they had [???] of course [???] no uniforms
( such things being quite unknown ) [???] only a feather in their caps ; and they
were in practice rather haywards than policemen [???] more concerned with the
strayings of beasts than of people . there were in all the shire only twelve
of them [???] three in each farthing [???] for inside work . a rather larger body [???]
varying at need [???] was employed to ' beat the bounds ' [???] and to see that
[???] of any kind [???] great or small [???] did not make themselves a [???] .
at the time when this story begins the bounders [???] as they were called [???]
had been greatly increased . there were many reports and complaints of
strange persons and creatures [???] about the borders [???] or over them : the
first sign that all was not quite as it should be [???] and always had been
except in tales and [???] of long ago . few heeded the sign [???] and not even
[???] yet had any notion of what it portended . sixty years had passed since
he set out on his memorable journey [???] and he was old even for [???] [???] who
reached a hundred as often as not ; but much evidently still remained of the
considerable wealth that he had brought back . how much or how little he
revealed to no one [???] not even to [???] his favourite ' nephew ' . and he still
kept secret the ring that he bad found .



4 . of the finding of the ring



as is told in the hobbit [???] there came one day to [???] ' s door the great
[???] [???] [???] the grey [???] and thirteen [???] with him : none other [???] indeed [???]
than [???] [???] [???] descendant of kings [???] and his twelve companions in
exile . with them he set out [???] to his own lasting astonishment [???] on a morning
of april [???] it being then the year [???] shire - reckoning [???] on a quest of great
treasure [???] the dwarf - hoards of the kings under the mountain [???] beneath [???]
in dale [???] far off in the east . the quest was successful [???] and the dragon that
guarded the hoard was destroyed . yet [???] though before all was won the battle
of five armies was fought [???] and [???] was slain [???] and many deeds of renown
were done [???] the matter would scarcely have concerned later history [???] or earned
more than a note in the long annals of the third age [???] but for an ' accident '
by the way . the party was assailed by [???] in a high pass of the misty
mountains as they went towards wilderland ; and so it happened that [???] was
lost for a while in the black orc - mines deep under the mountains [???] and there [???]
as he groped in vain in the dark [???] he put his hand on a ring [???] lying on the
floor of a tunnel . he put it in h is pocket . it seemed then like mere luck .
trying to find his way out . [???] went on down to the roots of the
mountains [???] until he could go no further . at the bottom of the tunnel lay a
cold lake far from the light [???] and on an island of rock in the water lived
[???] . he was a loathsome little creature : he [???] a small boat with his
large flat feet [???] peering with pale [???] eyes and catching blind fish
with his long fingers [???] and eating them raw . he ate any living thing [???] even
orc [???] if he could catch it and strangle it without a struggle . he possessed a
secret treasure that had come to him long ages ago [???] when he still lived in
the light : a ring of gold that made its wearer invisible . it was the one
thing he loved [???] his ' precious ' [???] and he talked to it [???] even when it was not
with him . for he kept it hidden safe in a hole on his island [???] except when he
was hunting or spying on the ores of the mines .
maybe he would have attacked [???] at once [???] if the ring had been on him
when they met ; but it was not [???] and the hobbit held in his hand an elvish
knife [???] which served him as a sword . so to gain time [???] challenged [???]
to the riddle - game [???] saying that if he asked a riddle which [???] could not

guess [???] then he would kill him and eat him ; but if [???] defeated him [???] then
he would do as [???] wished : he would lead him to a way out of the [???] .
since he was lost in the dark without hope [???] and could neither go on nor
back . [???] accepted the challenge ; and they asked one another many [???] .
in the end [???] won the game [???] more by luck ( as it seemed ) than by wits ; for
he was [???] at last for a riddle to ask [???] and cried out [???] as his hand came
upon the ring he lad picked up and forgotten : what haw i got in my pocket ?
this [???] failed to answer [???] though he demanded three guesses .
the authorities [???] it is true [???] differ whether this last question was a
mere ' question ' and not a ' riddle ' according to the strict rules of the
game ; but all agree that [???] after accepting it and trying to guess the answer [???]
[???] was bound by his promise . and [???] pressed him to keep his word ;
for
the thought came to him that this [???] creature might prove false [???] even
though such promises were held sacred [???] and of old all but the wickedest
things feared to break them . but after ages alone in the dark [???] ' s heart
was black [???] and treachery was in it . he slipped away [???] and returned to the
island [???] of which [???] knew nothing [???] not far off in the dark water . there [???]
he thought [???] lay his ring . he was hungry now [???] and angry [???] and once his
' precious ' was with him he would not fear any weapon at all .
but the ring was not on the island ; he had lost it [???] it was gone . his
screech sent a shiver down [???] ' s back [???] though he did not yet understand
what had happened . but [???] had at last leaped to a guess [???] too late . what
has it got in its pocketses ? he cried . the light in his eyes was like a
green flame as he sped back to murder the hobbit and recover his ' precious ' .
just in time [???] saw his peril [???] and he fled blindly up the passage away
from the water ; and once more he was saved by his luck . for just as he ran
he put his hand in his pocket [???] and the ring slipped quietly on to his
finger . so it was that [???] passed him without seeing him [???] and went to
guard the way out [???] lest the ' thief ' should escape . warily [???] followed
him [???] as he went along [???] cursing [???] and talking to himself about his ' precious ' ;
from which talk at last even [???] guessed the truth [???] and hope came to him
in the darkness : he himself had found the marvellous ring and a chance of
escape from the [???] and from [???] .
at length they came to a halt before an unseen opening that led to the
lower gates of the mines [???] on the eastward side of the mountains . there
[???] [???] at bay [???] smelling and listening ; and [???] was tempted to

slay him with his sword . but pity stayed him [???] and though he kept the ring [???]
in which his only hope lay [???] he would not use it to help him kill the
wretched creature at a [???] . in the end [???] gathering his courage [???] he
leaped over [???] in the dark [???] and fled away down the passage [???] pursued by
his enemy ' s cries of hate and despair : thief [???] thief ! [???] ! we hates it
for ever !
now it is a curious fact that this is not the story as [???] first told
it to his companions . to them his account was that [???] had promised to
give him a present [???] if he won the game ; but when [???] went to fetch it
from his island he found the treasure was gone : a magic ring [???] which had been
given to him long ago on his birthday . [???] guessed that this was the very
ring that he had found [???] and as he had won the game [???] it was already his by
right . but being in a tight place [???] he said nothing about it [???] and made [???]
show him the way out [???] as a reward instead of a present . this account [???]
set down in his [???] [???] and he seems never to have altered it himself [???] not
even after the council of [???] . evidently it still appeared in the
origina l red book [???] as it did in several of the copies and [???] . but
many copies contain the true account ( as an [???] ) [???] derived no doubt
from notes by [???] or [???] [???] both of whom learned the truth [???] though they
seem to have been unwilling to delete anything actually written by the old
hobbit himself .
[???] [???] however [???] [???] [???] ' s first story [???] as soon as he heard
it [???] and he continued to be very curious about the ring . eventually he got
the true tale out of [???] after much questioning [???] which for a while
strained their friendship ; but the [???] seemed to think the truth
important . though he did not say so to [???] [???] he also thought it important [???]
and disturbing [???] to find that the good hobbit had not told the truth from the
first : quite contrary to his habit . the idea of a ' present ' was not mere
[???] invention [???] all the same . it was suggested to [???] [???] as he
confessed [???] by [???] ' s talk that he overheard ; for [???] did [???] in fact [???] call
the ring his ' birthday present ' [???] many times . that also [???] thought
strange and suspicious ; but he did not discover the truth in this point for
many more years [???] as will be seen in this book .
of [???] ' s later adventures little more need be said here . wi th the
help of the ring he escaped from the orc - guards at the gate and rejoined his
companions . he used the ring many times on his quest [???] chiefly for the help
of his friends ; but he kept it secret from them as long as he could . after

his return to his home he never spoke of it again to anyone [???] save [???]
and [???] ; and no one else in the shire knew of its existence [???] or so he
believed . only to [???] did he show the account of his journey that he was
writing .
his sword [???] sting [???] [???] hu ng over his [???] [???] and his coat of
marvellous mail [???] the gift of the [???] from the dragon - hoard [???] he lent to a
museum [???] to the michel delving [???] - house in fact . but he kept in a drawer
at bag end the old cloak and hood that he had worn on his travels ; and the
ring [???] secured by a fine chain [???] remained in his pocket .
he returned to his home at bag end on june the [???] in his fifty - second
year ( s . r . [???] ) [???] and nothing very notable occurred in the shire until mr .
[???] began the pr [???] for the celebration of his
hundred - and - eleventh birthday ( s . r . [???] ) . at this point this history
begins .



note on the shire records



at the end of the third age the part played by the [???] in the great
events that led to the inclusion of the shire in the [???] kingdom
awakened among them a more [???] interest in their own history ; and
many of their traditions [???] up to that time still mainly oral [???] were collected
and written down . the greater [???] were also concerned with events in
the kingdom at large [???] and many of their members studied its ancient
histories and [???] . by the end of the first century of the fourth age
there were already to be found in the shire several [???] tha t contained
many [???] books and records .
the largest of these collections were probably at undertowers [???] at great
[???] [???] and at brandy hall . this account of the end of the third age is
drawn mainly from the red book of [???] . that most important source
for
the history of the war of the ring was so called because it was long
preserved at undertowers [???] the home of the [???] [???] wardens of the
[???] . 1 it was in origin [???] ' s private diary [???] which he took with him
to [???] . [???] brought it back to the shire [???] together with many loose
leaves of notes [???] and during s . r . [???] - 1 he nearly filled its pages with his
account of the war . but [???] to it and preserved with it [???] probably m a
single red case [???] were the three large volumes [???] bound in red leather [???] that
[???] gave to him as a parting gift . to these four volumes there was added
in [???] a fifth containing commentaries [???] [???] [???] and various other
matter concerning the hobbit members of the fellowship .
the original red book has not been preserved [???] but many copies were
made [???] especially of the first volume [???] for the use of the descendants of the
children of master [???] . the most important copy [???] however [???] has a
different history . it was kept at great [???] [???] but it was written in
condor [???] probably at the request of the great - grandson of [???] [???] and
completed in s . r . [???] ( f . a . [???] ) . its southern scribe appended this note :
[???] [???] king ' s writer [???] finished this work in iv [???] . it is an exact copy
in all details of the thain ' s book m minas [???] . that book was a copy [???]
made at the request of king [???] [???] of the red book of the [???] [???] and

was brought to him by the thain [???] when he retired to [???] in iv 64 .
the thain ' s book was thus the first copy made of the red book and
contained much that was later omitted or lost . in minas [???] it received
much [???] [???] and many corrections [???] especially of names [???] words [???] and
[???] in the elvish languages ; and there was added to it an [???]
version of those parts of the tale of [???] and [???] which lie outside
the account of the war . the full tale is stated to have been written by
[???] [???] grandson of the steward [???] [???] some time after the passing of the
king . but the chief importance of [???] ' s copy is that it alone contains
the whole of [???] ' s ' translations from the elvish ' . these three volumes
were found to be a work of great skill and learning in which [???] between [???]
and [???] [???] he had used all the sources [???] to him in [???] [???] both
living and written . but since they were little used by [???] [???] being almost
entirely concerned with the elder days [???] no more is said of them here .
since [???] and [???] became the heads of their great [???] [???]
and at the same time kept up their [???] with [???] and [???] [???] the
[???] at [???] and [???] contained much that did not appear
in the red book . in brandy hall there were many works dealing with [???]
and the history of [???] . some of these were composed or begun by
[???]
himself [???] though in the shire he was chiefly remembered for his [???] of
the shire [???] and for his reckoning of years m which he discussed the relation
of the [???] of the shire and bree to those of [???] [???] [???] [???] and
[???] . he also wrote a short treatise on old words and names in the shire [???]
having special interest in discovering the kinship with the language of the
[???] of such ' shire - words ' as [???] and old elements in place names .
at great [???] the books were of less interest to shire - folk [???] though
more important for larger history . none of them was written by [???] [???] but
he and his successors collected many [???] written by scribes of
[???] : mainly copies or summaries of histories or [???] relating to
[???] and his heirs . only here in the shire were to be found extensive
materials for the history of n [???] menor and the arising of [???] . it was
probably at great [???] that the tale of years1 was put together [???] with the
assistance of material collected by [???] . though the dates given are
often [???] [???] especially for the second age [???] they deserve attention . it
is probable that mer [???] obtained assistance and information from
[???] [???] which he visited more than once . there [???] though [???] had

departed [???] his sons long remained [???] together with some of the high - elven folk .
it is said that [???] went to dwell there after the departure of
[???] ; but there is no record of the day when at last he sought the grey
havens [???] and with him went the last living memory of the elder days in
middle - earth .

chapter 1 . a long - expected party



when mr . [???] [???] of bag end announced that he would shortly be
celebrating his eleventy - first birthday with a party of special
[???] [???] there was much talk and [???] in [???] .
[???] was very rich and very peculiar [???] and had been the wonder of the
shire for sixty years [???] ever since his remarkable [???] and
unexpected return . the riches he had brought back from his travels had now
become a local legend [???] and it was popularly believed [???] whatever the old folk
might say [???] that the hill at bag end was full of [???] stuffed with
treasure . and if that was not enough for fame [???] there was also his prolonged
vigour to marvel at . time wore on [???] but it seemed to have little effect on
mr . [???] . at ninety he was much the same as at fifty . at ninety - nine they
began to call him well - preserved [???] but unchanged would have been nearer the
mark . there were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much
of a good thing ; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess ( apparently )
perpetual youth as well as ( [???] ) [???] wealth .
' it will have to be paid for [???] ' they said . ' it isn ' t natural [???] and
trouble will come of it ! '
but so far trouble had not come ; and as mr . [???] was generous with
his money [???] most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good
fortune . he remained on visiting terms with his [???] ( except [???] of
course [???] the sackville - [???] ) [???] and he had many devoted admirers among
the
[???] of poor and [???] [???] . but he had no close friends [???] until
some of his younger cousins began to grow up .
the eldest of these [???] and [???] ' s favourite [???] was young [???] [???] .
when [???] was ninety - nine [???] he adopted [???] as his heir [???] and brought him to
live at bag end ; and the hopes of the sackville - [???] were finally
dashed . [???] and [???] happened to have the same birthday [???] [???]
[???] .
' you had better come and live here [???] [???] my lad [???] ' said [???] one day ; ' and
then we can celebrate our birthday - parties comfortably together . ' at that

time [???] was still in his tweens [???] as the [???] called the [???]
twenties between childhood and coming of age at thirty - three .
twelve more years passed . each year the [???] had given very lively
combined birthday - parties at bag end ; but now it was understood that
something quite [???] was being planned for that autumn . [???] was
going to be eleventy - one [???] 111 [???] a rather curious number and a very
respectable age for a hobbit ( the old took himself had only reached 130 ) ;
and [???] was going to be thirty - three [???] 33 ) an important number : the date of
his ' coming of age ' .
tongues began to wag in [???] and bywater ; and rumour of the coming
event travelled all over the shire . the history and character of mr . [???]
[???] became once again the chief topic of conversation ; and the older
folk suddenly found their [???] in welcome demand .
no one had a more attentive audience than old ham [???] [???] commonly
known as the [???] . he held forth at the ivy bush [???] a small inn on the
bywater road ; and he spoke with some authority [???] for he had tended the garden
at bag end for forty years [???] and had helped old holman in the same job befor e
that . now that he was himself growing old and stiff in the joints [???] the job
was mainly carried on by his youngest son [???] sam [???] . both father and son
were on very friendly terms with [???] and [???] . they lived on the hill
itself [???] in number 3 [???] row just below bag end .
' a very nice well - spoken [???] is mr . [???] [???] as i ' ve always
said [???] ' the [???] declared . with perfect truth : for [???] was very polite to
him [???] calling him ' master hamfast ' [???] and consulting him constantly upon the
growing of [???] - in the matter of ' roots ' [???] especially [???] [???] the
[???] was recognized as the leading authority by all in the neighbourhood
( including himself ) .
' but what about this [???] that lives with him ? ' asked old noakes of
bywater . ' [???] is his name [???] but he ' s more than half a [???] [???] they
say . it beats me why any [???] of [???] should go looking for a wife
away there in buckland [???] where folks are so queer . '
' and no wonder they ' re queer [???] ' put in [???] twofoot ( the [???] ' s
next - door neighbour ) [???] ' if they live on the wrong side of the [???]
river [???] and right agin the old forest . that ' s a dark bad place [???] if half the
tales be true . '
' you ' re right [???] dad ! ' said the [???] . ' not that the [???] of
buck - land live in the old forest ; but they ' re a queer breed [???] seemingly . they

fool about with boats on that big river - and that isn ' t natural . small
wonder that trouble came of it [???] i say . but be that as it may [???] mr . [???] is
as nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meet . very much like mr . [???] [???]
and in more than looks . after all his father was a [???] . a decent
respectable hobbit was mr . drogo [???] ; there was never much to tell of
him [???] till he was drownded . '
' drownded ? ' said several voices . they had heard this and other darker
rumours before [???] of course ; but [???] have a passion for family history [???]
and they were ready to hear it again . ' well [???] so they say [???] ' said the [???] .
' you see : mr . drogo [???] he married poor miss primula [???] . she was
our
mr . [???] ' s first cousin on the mother ' s side ( her mother being the youngest
of the old took ' s daughters ) ; and mr . drogo was his second cousin . so mr .
[???] is his first and second cousin [???] once removed either way [???] as the saying
is [???] if you follow me . and mr . drogo was staying at brandy hall with his
father - in - law [???] old master [???] [???] as he often did after his marriage ( him
being partial to his [???] [???] and old [???] keeping a mighty generous
table ) ; and he went out boating on the [???] river ; and he and his wife
were drownded [???] and poor mr . [???] only a child and all . '
' i ' ve heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight [???] ' said
old noakes ; ' and it was drogo ' s weight as sunk the boat . '
' and i heard she pushed him in [???] and he pulled her in after him [???] ' said
sandyman [???] the [???] miller .
' you shouldn ' t listen to all you hear [???] sandyman [???] ' said the [???] [???] who
did not much like the miller . ' there isn ' t no call to go ta lking of pushing
and pulling . boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without
looking further for the cause of trouble . anyway : there was this mr . [???]
left an orphan and [???] [???] as you might say [???] among those queer
[???] [???] being brought up anyhow in brandy hall . a regular warren [???] by
all accounts . old master [???] never had fewer than a couple of hundred
relations in the place . mr . [???] never did a kinder deed than when he
brought the lad back to live among decent folk .
' but i reckon it was a [???] shock for those sackville - [???] . they
thought they were going to get bag end [???] that time when he went off and was
thought to be dead . and then he comes back and orders them off ; and he goes
on living and living [???] and never looking a day older [???] bless him ! and suddenly
he produces an heir [???] and has all the papers made out proper . the

sackville - [???] won ' t never see the inside of bag end now [???] or it is to
be hoped not . '
' there ' s a tidy bit of money tucked away up there [???] i hear tell [???] ' said a
stranger [???] a visitor on business from michel delving in the [???] .
' all the top of your hill is full of [???] packed with chests of gold and
silver [???] and [???] [???] by what i ' ve heard . '
' then you ' ve heard more than i can speak to [???] ' answered the [???] . i
know nothing about [???] . mr . [???] is free with his money [???] and there seems
no lack of it ; but i know of no tunnel - making . i saw mr . [???] when he came
back [???] a matter of sixty years ago [???] when i was a lad . i ' d not long come
prentice to old holman ( him being my dad ' s cousin ) [???] but he had me up at bag
end helping him to keep folks from trampling and [???] all over the
garden while the sale was on . and in the middle of it all mr . [???] comes up
the hill with a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests . i
don ' t doubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in foreign
parts [???] where there be mountains of gold [???] they say ; but there wasn ' t enough
to fill [???] . but my lad sam will know more about that . he ' s in and out
of bag end . crazy about stories of the old days he is [???] and he listens to all
mr . [???] ' s tales . mr . [???] has learned him his letters - meaning no harm [???]
mark you [???] and i hope no harm will come of it .
' elves and dragons ' i says to him . ' [???] and [???] are better
for me and you . don ' t go getting mixed up in the business of your betters [???]
or you ' ll land in trouble too big for you [???] ' i says to him . and i might say
it to others [???] ' he added with a look at the stranger and the miller .
but the [???] did not convince his audience . the legend of [???] ' s
wealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger generation of
[???] .
' ah [???] but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at first [???] '
argued the miller [???] voicing common opinion . ' he ' s often away from home . and
look at the [???] folk that visit him : [???] coming at night [???] and
that old wandering conjuror [???] [???] [???] and all . you can say what you like [???]
[???] [???] but bag end ' s a queer place [???] and its folk are [???] . '
' and you can say what you like [???] about what you know no more of than you
do of boating [???] mr . sandyman [???] ' retorted the [???] [???] [???] the miller even
more than usual . if that ' s being queer [???] then we could do with a bit more
[???] in these parts . there ' s some not far away that wouldn ' t offer a
pint of beer to a friend [???] if they lived in a hole with golden walls . but

they do things proper at bag end . our sam says that everyone ' s going to be
invited to the party [???] and there ' s going to be presents [???] mark you [???] presents
for all - this very month as is . '
that very month was [???] [???] and as fine as you could ask . a day or
two later a rumour ( probably started by the knowledgeable sam ) was spread
about that there were going to be [???] - [???] [???] what is more [???] such
as had not been seen in the shire for nigh on a century [???] not indeed since
the old took died .
days passed and the day drew nearer . an odd - looking waggon laden with
odd - looking packages rolled into [???] one evening and toiled up the hill
to bag end . the startled [???] peered out of [???] doors to gape at it .
it was driven by [???] folk [???] singing strange songs : [???] with long
beards and deep hoods . a few of them remained at bag end . at the end of the
second week in [???] a cart came in through bywater from the direction
of the [???] bridge in broad daylight . an old man was driving it all
alone . he wore a tall pointed blue hat [???] a long grey cloak [???] and a silver
scarf . he had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond
the brim of his hat . small hobbit - children ran after the cart all through
[???] and right up the hill . it ha d a cargo of [???] [???] as they rightly
guessed . at [???] ' s front door the old man began to [???] : there were great
bundles of [???] of all sorts and shapes [???] each [???] with a large red
g and the elf - rune [???] .
that was [???] ' s mark [???] of course [???] and the old man was [???] the
[???] [???] whose fame in the shire was due mainly to his skill with fires [???]
smokes [???] and lights . his real business was far more difficult and dangerous [???]
but the shire - folk knew nothing about it . to them he was just one of the
' attractions ' at the party . hence the [???] of the hobbit - children . ' g
for grand ! ' they shouted [???] and the old man smiled . they knew him by sight [???]
though he only appeared in [???] occasionally and never stopped long ; but
neither they nor any but the oldest of their elders had seen one of his
firework displays - they now belonged to the [???] past .
when the old man [???] helped by [???] and some [???] [???] had finished
[???] . [???] gave a few [???] away ; but not a single squib or cracker
was [???] [???] to the [???] of the [???] .
' run away now ! ' said [???] . ' you will get plenty when the time
comes . ' then he disappeared inside with [???] [???] and the door was shut . the
young [???] stared at the door in vain for a while [???] and then made off [???]

feeling that the day of the party would never come .
inside bag end [???] [???] and [???] were sitting at the open window of a
small room looking out west on to the garden . the late afternoon was br ight
and peaceful . the flowers glowed red and golden : snap - dragons and
sun - flowers [???] and [???] trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in
at the round windows .
' how bright your garden looks ! ' said [???] .
' yes [???] ' said [???] . i am very fond indeed of it [???] and of all the dear old
shire ; but i think i need a holiday . '
' you mean to go on with your plan then ? '
' i do . i made up my mind months ago [???] and i haven ' t changed it . '
' very well . it is no good saying any more . stick to your plan - your
whole plan [???] mind - and i hope it will turn out for the best [???] for you [???] and
for all of us . '
' i hope so . anyway i mean to enjoy myself on thursday [???] and have my
little joke . '
' who will laugh [???] i wonder ? ' said [???] [???] shaking his head .
' we shall see [???] ' said [???] .
the next day more carts rolled up the hill [???] and still more carts . there
might have been some grumbling about ' dealing locally ' [???] but that very week
orders began to pour out of bag end for every kind of provision [???] commodity [???]
or luxury that could be obtained in [???] or bywater or anywhere in the
neighbourhood . people became [???] ; and they began to tick off the
days on the [???] ; and they watched eagerly for the postman [???] hoping for
[???] .
before long the [???] began pouring out [???] and the [???]
post - office was blocked [???] and the bywater post - office was snowed under [???] and
voluntary assistant postmen were called for . there was a constant stream of
them going up the hill [???] carrying hundreds of polite [???] on thank you [???]
i shall certainly come .
a notice appeared on the gate at bag end : no admittance except
on party
business . even those who had [???] or pretended to have party business were
seldom allowed inside . [???] was busy : writing [???] [???] ticking off
answers [???] packing up presents [???] and making some private preparations of his
own . from the time of [???] ' s arrival he remained hidden from view .
one morning the [???] woke to find the large field [???] south of [???] ' s

front door [???] covered with ropes and poles for tents and [???] . a special
entrance was cut into the bank leading to the road [???] and wide steps and a
large white gate were built there . the three hobbit - [???] of [???] row [???]
[???] the field [???] were [???] interested and generally envied . old
[???] [???] stopped even pretending to work in his garden .
the tents began to go up . there was a specially large [???] [???] so big
that the tree that grew in the field was right inside it [???] and stood proudly
near one end [???] at the head of the chief table . lanterns were hung on all its
branches . more promising still ( to the [???] ' mind ) : an enormous open - air
kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field . a draught of cooks [???]
from every inn and eating - house for miles around [???] arrived to [???] the
[???] and other odd folk that were quartered at bag end . [???] rose
to its height .
then the weather clouded over . that was on wednesday the eve of the
party . anxiety was intense . then thursday [???] [???] the [???] [???] actually
[???] . the sun got up [???] the clouds vanished [???] flags were [???] and the fun
began .
[???] [???] called it a party [???] but it was really a variety of
entertainments rolled into one . practically everybody living near was
invited . a very few were overlooked by accident [???] but as they turned up all
the same [???] that did not matter . many people from other parts of the shire
were also asked ; and there were even a few from outside the borders . [???]
met the guests ( and additions ) at the new white gate in person . he gave away
presents to all and sundry - the latter were those who went out again by a
back way and came in again by the gate . [???] give presents to other
people on their own [???] . not very expensive ones [???] as a rule [???] and not
so [???] as on this occasion ; but it was not a bad system . actually in
[???] and bywater every day in the year it was somebody ' s birthday [???] so
that every hobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present
at least once a week . but they never got tired of them .
on this occasion the presents were unusually good . the hobbit - children
were so excited that for a while they almost forgot about eating . there were
toys the like of which they had never seen before [???] all beautiful and some
obviously magical . many of them had indeed been ordered a year before [???] and
had come all the way from the mountain and from dale [???] and were of real
dwarf - make .
when every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the gate [???]

there were songs [???] dances [???] music [???] games [???] and [???] of course [???] food and drink .
there were three official meals : lunch [???] tea [???] and dinner ( or supper ) . but
lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact that at those times all the
guests were sitting down and eating together . at other times there were
merely lots of people eating and drinking - continuously from elevenses
until six - thirty [???] when the [???] started .
the [???] were by [???] : they were not only brought by him [???] but
designed and made by him ; and the special effects [???] set pieces [???] and flights
of rockets were let off by him . but there was also a generous distribution
of [???] [???] crackers [???] [???] [???] sparklers [???] torches [???] dwarf - candles [???]
elf - fountains [???] [???] - barkers and thunder - claps . they were all superb . the
art of [???] improved with age .
there were rockets like a flight of [???] birds singing with
sweet voices . there were green trees with trunks of dark smoke : their leaves
opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment [???] and their shining branches
dropped glowing flowers down upon the astonished [???] [???] disappearing with
a sweet scent just before they touched their [???] faces . there were
fountains of [???] that flew glittering into the trees ; there were
pillars of coloured fires that rose and turned into eagles [???] or sailing
ships [???] or a [???] of flying swans ; there was a red [???] and a
shower of yellow rain ; there was a forest of silver spears that sprang
suddenly into the air with a yell like an [???] army [???] and came down
again into the water with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes . and there was
also one last surprise [???] in honour of [???] [???] and it startled the [???]
exceedingly [???] as [???] intended . the lights went out . a great smoke went
up . it shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance [???] and began to glow
at the summit . it spouted green and scarlet flames . out flew a red - golden
dragon - not life - size [???] but terribly life - like : fire came from his jaws [???] his
eyes glared down ; there was a roar [???] and he [???] three times over the
heads of the crowd . they all ducked [???] and many fell fla t on their faces . the
dragon passed like an express train [???] turned a [???] [???] and burst over
bywater with a deafening [???] .
' that is the signal for supper ! ' said [???] . the pain and alarm
vanished at once [???] and the prostrate [???] leaped to their feet . there was
a [???] supper for everyone ; for everyone [???] that is [???] except those invited
to the special family dinner - party . this was held in the great [???] with
the tree . the [???] were limited to twelve dozen ( a number also called

by the [???] one gross [???] though the word was not considered proper to use
of people ) ; and the guests were selected from all the [???] to which
[???] and [???] were related [???] with the addition of a few special [???]
friends ( such as [???] ) . many young [???] were included [???] and present by
parental permission ; for [???] were easy - going with their children in the
matter of sitting up late [???] especially when there was a chance of getting
them a free meal . bringing up young [???] took a lot of provender .
there were many [???] and [???] [???] and also many tooks and
[???] ; there were various [???] ( relations of [???] [???] '
[???] ) [???] and various [???] ( [???] of his took grandfather ) ; and a
selection of [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???]
[???] and [???] . some of these were only very distantly
connected
with [???] [???] and some of them had hardly ever been in [???] before [???] as
they lived in remote corners of the shire . the sackville - [???] were not
forgotten . otho and his wife [???] were present . they disliked [???] and
detested [???] [???] but so [???] was the invitation card [???] written in
golden ink [???] that they had felt it was impossible to refuse . besides [???] their
cousin [???] [???] [???] had been specializing in food for many years and his table
had a high reputation .
all the one hundred and forty - four guests expected a pleasant feast ;
though they rather dreaded the after - dinner speech of their host ( an
[???] item ) . he was liable to drag in bits of what he called poetry ;
and sometimes [???] after a glass or two [???] would allude to the absurd adventures
of his mysterious journey . the guests were not disappointed : they had a very
pleasant feast [???] in fact an [???] entertainment : rich [???] abundant [???] varied [???]
and prolonged . the purchase of provisions fell almost to nothing throughout
the [???] in the ensuing weeks ; but as [???] ' s catering had [???] the
stocks of most stores [???] cellars and [???] for miles around [???] that did not
matter much .
after the feast ( more or less ) came the speech . most of the company
were [???] however [???] now in a tolerant mood [???] at that delightful stage which they
called ' filling up the corners ' . they were sipping their favourite drinks [???]
and [???] at their favourite dainties [???] and their fears were forgotten .
they were prepared to listen to anything [???] and to cheer at every full stop .
my dear people [???] began [???] [???] rising in his place . ' hear ! hear ! hear ! '
they shouted [???] and kept on repeating it in chorus [???] seeming [???] to

follow their own advice . [???] left his place and went and stood on a chair
under the [???] tree . the light of the lanterns fell on his beaming
face ; the golden buttons shone on his [???] silk [???] . they could
all see him standing [???] waving one hand in the air [???] the other was in his
trouser - pocket .
my dear [???] and [???] [???] he began again ; and my dear tooks and
[???] [???] and [???] [???] and [???] [???] and [???] [???] and [???] [???]
and
[???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] and [???] .
' [???] ! '
shouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the [???] . his name [???] of
course [???] was proudfoot [???] and well merited ; his feet were large [???] [???]
furry [???] and both were on the table .
[???] [???] repeated [???] . also my good sackville - [???] that i
welcome back at last to bag end . today is my one hundred and eleventh
birthday : i am eleventy - one today ! ' hurray ! hurray ! many happy returns ! '
they shouted [???] and they hammered joyously on the tables . [???] was doing
[???] . this was the sort of stuff they liked : short and obvious .
[???] hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as i am . deafening
cheers . cries of yes ( and no ) . noises of trumpets and horns [???] pipes and
flutes [???] and other musical instruments . there were [???] as has been said [???] many
young [???] present . hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled . most of
them bore the mark dale on them ; which did not convey much to most of
the
[???] [???] but they all agreed they were marvellous crackers . they contained
instruments [???] small [???] but of perfect make and enchanting tones . indeed [???] in one
corner some of the young tooks and [???] [???] supposing uncle [???] to
have finished ( since he had plainly said all that was necessary ) [???] now got up
an [???] [???] [???] and began a merry dance - tune . master everard took
and miss [???] [???] got on a table and with bells in their hands
began to dance the springle - ring : a pretty dance [???] but rather vigorous .
but [???] had not finished . seizing a horn from a youngster near by [???] he
blew three loud hoots . the noise [???] . [???] shall not keep you long [???] he
cried . cheers from all the assembly . [???] have called you all together for a
purpose . something in the way that he said this made an impression . there
was almost silence [???] and one or two of the tooks pricked up their ears .
indeed [???] for three purposes ! first of all [???] to tell you that i am

[???] fond of you all [???] and that eleventy - one years is too short a time
to live among such excellent and admirable [???] . tremendous [???] of
approval .
[???] don ' t know half of you half as well as i should like ; and i like less
than half of you half as well as you deserve . this was unexpected and rather
difficult . there was some scattered clapping [???] but most of them were trying
to work it out and see if it came to a compliment .
secondly [???] to celebrate my birthday . cheers again . [???] should say : our
birthday . for it is [???] of course [???] also the birthday of my heir and nephew [???]
[???] . he comes of age and into his inheritance today . some [???]
clapping by the elders ; and some loud shouts of ' [???] ! [???] ! jolly old
[???] [???] ' from the [???] . the sackville - [???] [???] [???] and wondered what
was meant by ' coming into his inheritance ' . together we score one hundred
and forty - four . your numbers were chosen to fit this remarkable total : one
gross [???] if i may use the expression . no cheers . this was ridiculous . many of
his guests [???] and especially the sackville - [???] [???] were [???] [???] feeling
sure they had only been asked to fill up the required number [???] like goods in
a package . ' one gross [???] indeed ! vulgar expression . '
it is also [???] if i may be allowed to refer to ancient history [???] the
[???] of my arrival by barrel at [???] on the long lake ; though the
fact that it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion . i was only
fifty - one then [???] and [???] did not seem so important . the banquet was
very [???] [???] however [???] though i had a bad cold at the time [???] i remember [???] and
could only say ' thag you very buch ' . i now repeat it more correctly : thank
you very much for coming to my little party . obstinate silence . they all
feared that a song or some poetry was now imminent ; and they were getting
bored . why couldn ' t he stop talking and let them drink his health ? but [???]
did not sing or recite . he paused for a moment .
thirdly and finally [???] he said [???] i wish to make an announcement . he
spoke
this last word so loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up who still could .
i regret to announce that - though [???] as i said [???] eleventy - one years is far too
short a time to spend among you - this is the end . i am going . i am leaving
now . good - bye !
he stepped down and vanished . there was a blinding flash of light [???] and
the guests all [???] . when they opened their eyes [???] was nowhere to be
seen . one hundred and forty - four [???] [???] sat back speechless .

old odo proudfoot removed his feet from the table and stamped . then there
was a dead silence [???] until suddenly [???] after several deep breaths [???] every
[???] [???] [???] [???] took [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] burrows [???] bolger [???]
[???] [???] [???] [???] goodbody [???] [???] [???] and proudfoot began to
talk
at once .
it was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste [???] and more
food and drink were needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyance . ' he ' s
mad . i always said so [???] ' was probably the most popular comment . even the
tooks ( with a few exceptions ) thought [???] ' s behaviour was absurd . for the
moment most of them took it for granted that his [???] was nothing
more than a ridiculous prank .
but old rory [???] was not so sure . neither age nor an enormous
dinner had clouded his wits [???] and he said to his daughter - in - law [???] [???] :
' there ' s something fishy in this [???] my dear ! i believe that mad [???] is off
again . silly old fool . but why worry ? he hasn ' t taken the [???] with him . '
he called loudly to [???] to send the wine round again .
[???] was the only one present who had said nothing . for some time he
had sat silent beside [???] ' s empty chair [???] and ignored all remarks and
questions . he had enjoyed the joke [???] of course [???] even though he had been in
the know . he had difficulty in keeping from laughter at the indignant
surprise of the guests . but at the same time he felt deeply troubled : he
realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly . most of the guests
went on eating and drinking and discussing [???] [???] ' oddities [???] past and
present ; but the sackville - [???] had already departed in wrath . [???]
did not want to have any more to do with the party . he gave orders for more
wine to be served ; then he got up and drained his own glass silently to the
health of [???] [???] and slipped out of the [???] .
as for [???] [???] [???] even while he was making his speech [???] he had been
fingering the golden ring in his pocket : his magic ring that he had kept
secret for so many years . as he stepped down he slipped it on his finger [???]
and he was never seen by any hobbit in [???] again .
he walked briskly back to his hole [???] and stood for a moment listening
with a smile to the din in the [???] and to the sounds of [???] in
other parts of the field . then he went in . he took off his party clothes [???]
folded up and wrapped in tissue - paper his [???] silk [???] [???] and
put it away . then he put on quickly some old [???] garments [???] and fastened

round his waist a worn leather belt . on it he hung a short sword in a
battered black - leather [???] . from a locked drawer [???] smelling of
moth - balls [???] he took out an old cloak and hood . they had been locked up as if
they were very precious [???] but they were so patched and [???] that
their original colour could hardly be guessed : it might have been dark
green . they were rather too large for him . he then went into his study [???] and
from a large strong - box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths [???] and a
leather - bound [???] ; and also a large bulky [???] . the book and
bundle he stuffed into the top of a heavy bag that was standing there [???]
already nearly full . into the [???] he slipped his golden ring [???] and its
fine chain [???] and then sealed it [???] and addressed it to [???] . at first he put
it on the [???] [???] but suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his
pocket . at that moment the door opened and [???] came quickly in .
' hullo ! ' said [???] . ' i wondered if you would turn up . '
' i am glad to find you visible [???] ' replied the [???] [???] sitting down in a
chair [???] ' i wanted to catch you and have a few final words . i suppose you feel
that everything has gone off [???] and according to plan ? '
' yes [???] i do [???] ' said [???] . [???] though that flash was surprising : it quite
startled me [???] let alone the others . a little addition of your own [???] i
suppose ? '
it was . you have wisely kept that ring secret all these years [???] and it
seemed to me necessary to give your guests something else that would seem to
explain your sudden vanishment . '
' and would spoil my joke . you are an [???] old busybody [???] ' laughed
[???] [???] ' but i expect you know best [???] as usual . '
' i do - when i know anything . but i don ' t feel too sure about this
whole affair . it has now come to the final point . you have had your joke [???]
and alarmed or offended most of your relations [???] and given the whole shire
something to talk about for nine days [???] or ninety - nine more likely . are you
going any further ? '
' yes [???] i am . i feel i need a holiday [???] a very long holiday [???] as i have
told you before . probably a permanent holiday : i don ' t expect i shall
return . in fact [???] i don ' t mean to [???] and i have made all arrangements .
' i am old [???] [???] . i don ' t look it [???] but i am beginning to feel it in
my heart of hearts . well - preserved indeed ! ' he snorted . ' why [???] i feel all
thin [???] sort of stretched [???] if you know what i mean : like butter that has been
scraped over too much bread . that can ' t be right . i need a change [???] or

something . '
[???] looked curiously and closely at him . ' no [???] it does not seem
right [???] ' he said thoughtfully . ' no [???] after all i believe your plan is probably
the best . '
' well [???] i ' ve made up my mind [???] anyway . i want to see mountains again [???]
[???] [???] mountains [???] and then find somewhere where i can rest . in peace and
quiet [???] without a lot of [???] prying around [???] and a string of confounded
visitors hanging on the bell . i might find somewhere where i can finish my
book . i have thought of a nice ending for it : and he lived happily ever
after to the end of his days . '
[???] laughed . i hope he will . but nobody will read the book [???] however
it ends . '
' oh [???] they may [???] in years to come . [???] has read some already [???] as far as
it has gone . you ' ll keep an eye on [???] [???] won ' t you ? '
' yes [???] i will - two eyes [???] as often as i can spare them . '
' he would come with me [???] of course [???] if i asked him . in fact he offered
to once [???] just before the party . but he does not really want to [???] yet . i want
to see the wild country again before i die [???] and the mountains ; but he is
still in love with the shire [???] with woods and fields and little rivers . he
ought to be comfortable here . i am leaving everything to him [???] of course [???]
except a few oddments . i hope he will be happy [???] when he gets used to being
on his own . it ' s time he was his own master now . '
' everything ? ' said [???] . ' the ring as well ? you agreed to that [???] you
remember . '
' well [???] er [???] yes [???] i suppose so [???] ' [???] [???] .
' where is it ? '
' in an [???] [???] if you must know [???] ' said [???] impatiently . ' there on
the [???] . well [???] no ! here it is in my pocket ! ' he [???] . ' isn ' t
that odd now ? ' he said softly to himself . ' yet after all [???] why not ? why
shouldn ' t it stay there ? '
[???] looked again very hard at [???] [???] and there was a gleam in his
eyes . ' i think [???] [???] [???] ' he said quietly [???] ' i should leave it behind . don ' t
you want to ? '
' well yes - and no . now it comes to it [???] i don ' t like parting with it at
all [???] i may say . and i don ' t really see why i should . why do you want me to ? '
he asked [???] and a curious change came over his voice . it was sharp with

suspicion and annoyance . ' you are always badgering me about my ring ; but
you
have never bothered me about the other things that i got on my journey . '
' no [???] but i had to badger you [???] ' said [???] . ' i wanted the truth . it
was important . magic rings are - well [???] magical ; and they are rare and
curious . i was professionally interested in your ring [???] you may say ; and i
still am . i should like to know where it is [???] if you go wandering again . also
i think you have had it quite long enough . you won ' t need it any more .
[???] [???] unless i am quite mistaken . '
[???] [???] [???] and there was an angry light in his eyes . his kindly
face grew hard . ' why not ? ' he cried . ' and what business is it of yours [???]
anyway [???] to know what i do with my own things ? it is my own . i found it . it
came to me . '
' yes [???] yes [???] ' said [???] . ' but there is no need to get angry . '
' if i am it is your fault [???] ' said [???] . ' it is mine [???] i tell you . my
own . my precious . yes [???] my precious . '
the [???] ' s face remained grave and attentive [???] and only a [???] in
his deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed . ' it has been
called that before [???] ' he said [???] ' but not by you . '
' but i say it now . and why not ? even if [???] said the same once . it ' s
not his now [???] but mine . and i shall keep it [???] i say . '
[???] stood up . he spoke sternly . ' you will be a fool if you do .
[???] [???] ' he said . ' you make that clearer with every word you say . it has got
far too much hold on you . let it go ! and then you can go yourself [???] and be
free . '
' i ' ll do as i choose and go as i please [???] ' said [???] [???] .
' now [???] now [???] my dear hobbit ! ' said [???] . ' all your long life we have
been friends [???] and you owe me something . come ! do as you promised : give it
up ! '
' well [???] if you want my ring yourself [???] say so ! ' cried [???] . ' but you
won ' t get it . i won ' t give my precious away [???] i tell you . ' his hand strayed
to the hilt of his small sword .
[???] ' s eyes flashed . it will be my turn to get angry soon [???] ' he said .
if you say that again [???] i shall . then you will see [???] the grey
[???] . ' he took a step towards the hobbit [???] and he seemed to grow tall
and [???] ; his shadow filled the little room .
[???] backed away to the wall [???] brea thing hard [???] his hand clutching at

his pocket . they stood for a while facing one another [???] and the air of the
room [???] . [???] ' s eyes remained bent on the hobbit . slowly his hands
[???] [???] and he began to tremble .
' i don ' t know what has come over you [???] [???] [???] ' he said . ' you have
never been like this before . what is it all about ? it is mine isn ' t it ? i
found it [???] and [???] would have killed me [???] if i hadn ' t kept it . i ' m not a
thief [???] whatever he said . '
' i have never called you one [???] ' [???] answered . ' and i am not one
either . i am not trying to rob you [???] but to help you . i wish you would trust
me [???] as you used . ' he turned away [???] and the shadow passed . he seemed to
[???] again to an old grey man [???] bent and troubled .
[???] drew his hand over his eyes . i am sorry [???] ' he said . ' but i felt so
queer . and yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with it any
more . it has been so growing on my mind lately . sometimes i have felt it was
like an eye looking at me . and i am always wanting to put it on and
disappear [???] don ' t you know ; or wondering if it is safe [???] and pulling it out to
make sure . i tried locking it up [???] but i found i couldn ' t rest without it in
my pocket . i don ' t know why . and i don ' t seem able to make up my mind . '
' then trust mine [???] ' said [???] . ' it is quite made up . go away and
leave it behind . stop possessing it . give it to [???] [???] and i will look after
him . '
[???] stood for a moment tense and [???] . presently he sighed . ' all
right [???] ' he said with an effort . i will . ' then he [???] his shoulders [???] and
smiled rather ruefully . ' after all that ' s what this party business was all
about [???] really : to give away lots of birthday presents [???] and somehow make it
easier to give it away at the same time . it hasn ' t made it any easier in the
end [???] but it would be a pity to waste all my preparations . it would quite
spoil the joke . '
' indeed it would take away the only point i ever saw in the affair [???] '
said [???] .
' very well [???] ' said [???] [???] ' it goes to [???] with all the rest . ' he drew
a deep breath . ' and now i really must be starting [???] or somebody else will
catch me . i have said good - bye [???] and i couldn ' t bear to do it all over
again . ' he picked up his bag and moved to the door .
' you have still got the ring in your pocket [???] ' said the [???] . ' well [???]
so i have ! ' cried [???] . ' and my will and all the other [???] too . you
had better take it and deliver it for me . that will be safest . '

' no [???] don ' t give the ring to me [???] ' said [???] . ' put it on the
[???] . it will be safe enough there [???] till [???] comes . i shall wait
for him . '
[???] took out the [???] [???] but just as he was about to set it by the
clock [???] his hand jerked back [???] and the packet fell on the floor . before he
could pick it up [???] the [???] stooped and seized it and set it in its place .
a spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbit ' s face again . suddenly it
gave way to a look of relief and a laugh . ' well [???] that ' s that [???] ' he said . ' now
i ' m off ! '
they went out into the hall . [???] chose his favourite stick from the
stand ; then he whistled . three [???] came out of different rooms where
they had been busy .
' is everything ready ? ' asked [???] . ' everything packed and la belled ? '
' everything [???] ' they answered .
' well [???] let ' s start then ! ' he stepped out of the front - door .
it was a fine night [???] and the black sky was dotted with stars . he looked
up [???] [???] the air . ' what fun ! what fun to be off again [???] off on the road
with [???] ! this is what i have really been longing for [???] for years !
good - bye ! ' he said [???] looking at his old home and bowing to the door .
' good - bye [???] [???] ! '
' good - bye [???] for the present [???] [???] . take care of yourself ! you are old
enough [???] and perhaps wise enough . '
' take care ! i don ' t care . don ' t you worry about me ! i am as happy now
as i have ever been [???] and that is saying a great deal . but the time has come .
i am being swept off my feet at last [???] ' he added [???] and then in a low voice [???] as
if to himself [???] he sang softly in the dark :
the road goes ever on and on
down from the door where it began .
now far ahead the road has gone [???]
and i must follow [???] if i can [???]
pursuing it with eager feet [???]
until it joins some larger way
where many paths and errands meet .
and whither then ? i cannot say .
he paused [???] silent for a moment . then without another word he turned
away from the lights and voices in the fields and tents [???] and followed by his
three companions went round into his garden [???] and trotted down the long

[???] path . he jumped over a low place in the hedge at the bottom [???] and
took to the [???] [???] passing into the night like a rustle of wind in the
grass .
[???] remained for a while staring after him into the darkness .
' [???] [???] my dear [???] - until our next meeting ! ' he said softly and went
back [???] .
[???] came in soon afterwards [???] and found him sitting in the dark [???] deep
in thought . ' has he gone ? ' he asked .
' yes [???] ' answered [???] [???] ' he has gone at last . '
' i wish - i mean [???] i hoped until this evening that it was only a joke [???] '
said [???] . ' but i knew in my heart that he really meant to go . he always
used to joke about serious things . i wish i had come back sooner [???] just to
see him off . '
i think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end [???] ' said
[???] . ' don ' t be too troubled . he ' ll be all right - now . he left a packet
for you . there it is ! '
[???] took the [???] from the [???] [???] and glanced at it [???] but
did not open it .
' you ' ll find his will and all the other [???] in there [???] i think [???] '
said the [???] . ' you are the master of bag end now . and also [???] i fancy [???]
you ' ll find a golden ring . '
' the ring ! ' exclaimed [???] . ' has he left me that ? i wonder why . still [???]
it may be useful . '
' it may [???] and it may not [???] ' said [???] . ' i should not make use of it [???]
if i were you . but keep it secret [???] and keep it safe ! now i am going to bed . '
as master of bag end [???] felt it his painful duty to say good - bye to
the guests . rumours of strange events had by now spread all over the field [???]
but [???] would only say no doubt everything will be cleared up in the
morning . about midnight carriages came for the important folk . one by one
they rolled away [???] filled with full but very [???] [???] . gardeners
came by arrangement [???] and removed in wheel - barrows those that had
[???] remained behind .
night slowly passed . the sun rose . the [???] rose rather later .
morning went on . people came and began ( by orders ) to clear away the
[???] and the tables and the chairs [???] and the spoons and knives and
bottles and plates [???] and the lanterns [???] and the flowering [???] in boxes [???] and
the [???] and cracker - paper [???] the forgotten bags and gloves and

handkerchiefs [???] and the [???] food ( a very small item ) . then a number of
other people came ( without orders ) : [???] [???] and [???] [???] and [???] [???] and
tooks [???] and other guests that lived or were staying near . by mid - day [???] when
even the best - fed were out and about again [???] there was a large crowd at bag
end [???] [???] but not unexpected .
[???] was waiting on the step [???] smiling [???] but looking rather tired and
worried . he welcomed all the callers [???] but he had not much more to say than
before . his reply to all [???] was simply this : ' mr . [???] [???] has
gone away ; as far as i know [???] for good . ' some of the visitors he invited to
come inside [???] as [???] had left ' messages ' for them .
inside in the hall there was piled a large [???] of packages and
parcels and small articles of furniture . on every item there was a label
tied . there were several [???] of this sort :
for [???] took [???] for his very own [???] from [???] [???] on an [???] .
[???]
had carried off many [???] ones .
for dora [???] in memory of a long [???] [???] with love
from
[???] [???] on a large waste - paper basket . dora was drogo ' s sister and the eldest
surviving female relative of [???] and [???] ; she was ninety - nine [???] and had
written reams of good advice for more than half a century .
for milo burrows [???] hoping it will be useful [???] from b . b . [???] on a gold pen
and ink - bottle . milo never answered letters .
for angelica ' s use [???] from uncle [???] [???] on a round [???] mirror . she
was
a young [???] [???] and too obviously considered her face shapely .
for the collection of hugo [???] [???] from a [???] [???] on an
( empty ) book - case . hugo was a great borrower of books [???] and worse than usual
at returning them .
for [???] sackville - [???] [???] as a present [???] on a case of
silver
spoons . [???] believed that she had acquired a good many of his spoons [???]
while he was away on his former journey . [???] knew that quite well . when
she arrived later in the day [???] she took the point at once [???] but she also took
the spoons .
this is only a small selection of the assembled presents . [???] ' s
residence had got rather [???] up with things in the course of his long

life . it was a tendency of hobbit - holes to get [???] up : for which the
custom of giving so many birthday - presents was largely responsible . not [???] of
course [???] that the birthday - presents were always new [???] there were one or two
old [???] of forgotten uses that had circulated all around the [???] ;
but [???] had usually given new presents [???] and kept those that he received .
the old hole was now being cleared a little .
every one of the various parting gifts had [???] [???] written out
personally by [???] [???] and several had some point [???] or some joke . but [???] of
course [???] most of the things were given where they would be wanted and
welcome . the poorer [???] [???] and especially those of [???] row [???] did very
well . old [???] [???] got two sacks of [???] [???] a new spade [???] a woollen
[???] [???] and a bottle of [???] for creaking joints . old rory
[???] [???] in return for much [???] [???] got a dozen bottles of old
[???] : a strong red wine from the [???] [???] and now quite mature [???] as
it had been laid down by [???] ' s father . rory quite forgave [???] [???] and voted
him a capital fellow after the first bottle .
there was plenty of everything left for [???] . and [???] of course [???] all the
chief treasures [???] as well as the books [???] pictures [???] and more than enough
furniture [???] were left in his possession . there was [???] however [???] no sign nor
mention of money or [???] : not a penny - piece or a glass bead was given
away .
[???] had a very trying time that afternoon . a fa lse rumour that the
whole household was being distributed free spread like [???] ; and before
long the place was packed with people who had no business there [???] but could
not be kept out . [???] got torn off and mixed [???] and quarrels broke out . some
people tried to do swaps and deals in the hall ; and others tried to make off
with minor items not addressed to them [???] or with anything that seemed
[???] or [???] . the road to the gate was blocked with barrows and
[???] .
in the middle of the commotion the sackville - [???] arrived . [???]
had retired for a while and left his friend merry [???] to keep an eye
on things . when otho loudly demanded to see [???] [???] merry bowed [???] .
' he is [???] [???] ' he said . ' he is resting . '
' hiding [???] you mean [???] ' said [???] . ' anyway we want to see him and we
mean to see him . just go and tell him so ! '
merry left them a long while in the hall [???] and they had time to discover
their parting gift of spoons . it did not improve their tempers . eventually

they were shown into the study . [???] was sitting at a table with a lot of
papers in front of him . he looked [???] - to see sackville - [???] at
any rate ; and he stood up [???] [???] with something in his pocket . but he
spoke quite [???] .
the sackville - [???] were rather offensive . they began by offering
him bad bargain - prices ( as between friends ) for various [???] and
[???] things . when [???] replied that only the things specially
directed by [???] were being given away [???] they said the whole affair was very
fishy .
' only one thing is clear to me [???] ' said otho [???] ' and that is that you are
doing exceedingly well out of it . i insist on seeing the will . '
otho would have been [???] ' s heir [???] but for the adoption of [???] . he
read the will carefully and snorted . it was [???] unfortunately [???] very clear and
correct ( according to the legal customs of [???] [???] which demand among other
things seven [???] of witnesses in red ink ) .
' foiled again ! ' he said to his wife . ' and after waiting sixty years .
spoons ? [???] ! ' he snapped his fingers under [???] ' s nose and [???]
off . but [???] was not so easily got rid of . a little later [???] came out
of the study to see how things were going on and found her still about the
place [???] [???] [???] and comers and tapping the floors . he escorted
her firmly off the premises [???] after he had relieved her of several small ( but
rather [???] ) articles that had somehow fallen inside her [???] . her
face looked as if she was in the throes of thinking out a really crushing
parting remark ; but all she found to say [???] turning round on the step [???] was :
' you ' ll live to regret it [???] young fellow ! why didn ' t you go too ? you
don ' t belong here ; you ' re no [???] - you - you ' re a [???] ! '
' did you hear that [???] merry ? that was an insult [???] if you like [???] ' said [???]
as he shut the door on her .
' it was a compliment [???] ' said merry [???] [???] ' and so [???] of course [???] not
true . '
then they went round the hole [???] and [???] three young [???] ( two
[???] and a bolger ) who were knocking holes in the walls of one of the
cellars . [???] also had a [???] with young sancho proudfoot ( old odo
proudfoot ' s grandson ) [???] who had begun an [???] in the larger pantry [???]
where he thought there was an echo . the legend of [???] ' s gold excited both
curiosity and hope ; for [???] gold ( mysteriously obtained [???] if not
[???] ill - gotten ) [???] is [???] as every one knows [???] any one ' s for the finding

- unless the search is interrupted .
when he had overcome sancho and pushed him out [???] [???] [???] on a
chair in the hall . it ' s time to close the shop [???] merry [???] ' he said . ' lock the
door [???] and don ' t open it to anyone today [???] not even if they bring a battering
ram . ' then he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea .
he had hardly sat down [???] when there came a soft knock at the front - door .
' [???] again most likely [???] ' he thought . ' she must have thought of something
really [???] [???] and have come back again to say it . it can wait . '
he went on with his tea . the knock was repeated [???] much louder [???] but he
took no notice . suddenly the [???] ' s head appeared at the window .
' if you don ' t let me in [???] [???] [???] i shall blow your door right down your
hole and out through the hill [???] ' he said .
' my dear [???] ! half a minute ! ' cried [???] [???] running out of the room
to the door . ' come in ! come in ! i thought it was [???] . '
' then i forgive you . but i saw her some time ago [???] driving a pony - trap
towards bywater with a face that would have [???] new milk . '
' she had already nearly [???] me . honestly [???] i nearly tried on [???] ' s
ring . i longed to disappear . '
' don ' t do that ! ' said [???] [???] sitting down . ' do be careful of that
ring [???] [???] ! in fact [???] it is partly about that that i have come to say a last
word . '
' well [???] what about it ? '
' what do you know already ? '
' only what [???] told me . i have heard his story : how he found it [???] and
how he used it : on his journey [???] i mean . '
' which story [???] i wonder [???] ' said [???] .
' oh [???] not what he told the [???] and put in his book [???] ' said [???] . ' he
told me the true story soon after i came to live here . he said you had
pestered him till he told you [???] so i had better know too . [???] no secrets between
us [???] [???] [???] [???] he said ; [???] but they are not to go any further . it ' s mine
anyway . [???] '
' that ' s interesting [???] ' said [???] . ' well [???] what did you think of it
all ? '
' if you mean [???] inventing all that about a [???] present [???] [???] well [???] i thought the
true story much more likely [???] and i couldn ' t see the point of altering it at
all . it was very unlike [???] to do so [???] anyway ; and i thought it rather
odd . '

' so did i . but odd things may happen to people that have such treasures
- if they use them . let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it .
it may have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish to . '
' i don ' t understand [???] ' said [???] .
' neither do i [???] ' answered the [???] . ' i have merely begun to wonder
about the ring [???] especially since last night . no need to worry . but if you
take my advice you will use it very seldom [???] or not at all . at least i beg
you not to use it in any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion . i say
again : keep it safe [???] and keep it secret ! '
' you are very mysterious ! what are you afraid of ? '
' i am not certain [???] so i will say no more . i may be able to tell you
something when i come back . i am going off at once : so this is good - bye for
the present . ' he got up .
' at once ! ' cried [???] . ' why [???] i thought you were staying on for at
least a week . i was looking forward to your help . '
' i did mean to - but i have had to change my mind . i may be away for a
good while ; but i ' ll come and see you again [???] as soon as i can . expect me
when you see me ! i shall slip in quietly . i shan ' t often be visiting the
shire openly again . i find that i have become rather [???] . they say i
am a [???] and a disturber of the peace . some people are actually
accusing me of spiriting [???] away [???] or worse . if you want to know [???] there is
supposed to be a plot between you and me to get hold of his wealth . '
' some people ! ' exclaimed [???] . ' you mean otho and [???] . how
abominable ! i would give them bag end and everything else [???] if i could get
[???] back and go off tramping in the country with him . i love the shire .
but i begin to wish [???] somehow [???] that i had gone too . i wonder if i shall ever
see him again . '
' so do i [???] ' said [???] . ' and i wonder many other things . good - bye now !
take care of yourself ! look out for me [???] especially at unlikely times !
good - bye ! '
[???] saw him to the door . he gave a final wave of his hand [???] and walked
off at a surprising pace ; but [???] thought the old [???] looked unusually
bent [???] almost as if he was carrying a great weight . the evening was closing
in [???] and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the [???] . [???] did not
see him again for a long time .



[???] h4 [???] chapter 2 . [???] [???] h4 [???] the shadow of the past



the talk did not die down in nine or even ninety - nine days . the second
[???] of mr . [???] [???] was discussed in [???] [???] and indeed all
over the shire [???] for a year and a day [???] and was remembered much longer than
that . it became a fireside - story for young [???] ; and eventually mad
[???] [???] who used to vanish with a bang and a flash and reappear with bags
of jewels and gold [???] became a favourite character of legend and lived on long
after all the true events were forgotten .
but in the meantime [???] the general opinion in the neighbourhood was that
[???] [???] who had always been rather cracked [???] had at last gone quite mad [???] and
had run off into the blue . there he had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a
river and come to a tragic [???] but hardly an untimely [???] end . the blame was
mostly laid on [???] .
' if only that [???] [???] will leave young [???] alone [???] perhaps
he ' ll settle down and grow some hobbit - sense [???] ' they said . and to all
appearance the [???] did leave [???] alone [???] and he did settle down [???] but the
growth of hobbit - sense was not very noticeable . indeed [???] he at once began to
carry on [???] ' s reputation for oddity . he refused to go into mourning ; and
the next year he gave a party in honour of [???] ' s hundred - and - [???]
birthday [???] which he called hundred - weight feast . but that was short of the
mark [???] for twenty guests were invited and there were several meals at which
it snowed food and rained drink [???] as [???] say .
some people were rather shocked ; but [???] kept up the custom of giving
[???] ' s birthday party year after year until they got used to it . he said
that he did not think [???] was dead . when they asked : ' where is he then ? '
he [???] his shoulders .
he lived alone [???] as [???] had done ; but he had a good many friends [???]
especially among the younger [???] ( mostly descendants of the old took )
who had as children been fond of [???] and often in and out of bag end .
[???] [???] and [???] bolger were two of these ; but his closest friends
were [???] took ( usually called [???] ) [???] and merry [???] ( his real
name was [???] [???] but that was seldom remembered ) . [???] went tramping
all
over the shire with them ; but more often he wandered by himself [???] and to the
amazement of sensible folk he was sometimes seen far from home walking in

the hills and woods under the starlight . merry and [???] suspected that he
visited the elves at times [???] as [???] had done .
as time went on [???] people began to notice that [???] also showed signs of
good ' preservation ' : outwardly he retained the appearance of a robust and
[???] hobbit just out of his tweens . ' some folk have all the luck [???] ' they
said ; but it was not until [???] approached the usually more sober age of
fifty that they began to think it queer .
[???] himself [???] after the first shock [???] found that being his own master
and the mr . [???] of bag end was rather pleasant . for some years he was
quite happy and did not worry much about the future . but half unknown to
himself the regret that he had not gone with [???] was steadily growing . he
found himself wondering at times [???] especially in the autumn [???] about the wild
lands [???] and strange visions of mountains that he had never seen came into his
dreams . he began to sa y to himself : ' perhaps i shall cross the river myself
one day . ' to which the other half of his mind always replied : ' not yet . '
so it went on [???] until his forties were running out [???] and his [???]
birthday was drawing near : fifty was a number that he felt was somehow
[???] ( or [???] ) ; it was at any rate at that age that adventure had
suddenly befallen [???] . [???] began to feel restless [???] and the old paths
seemed too well - trodden . he looked at maps [???] and wondered what lay beyond
their edges : maps made in the shire showed mostly white spaces beyond its
borders . he took to wandering further afield and more often by himself ; and
merry and his other friends watched him anxiously . often he was seen walking
and talking with the strange [???] that began at this time to appear in
the shire .
there were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside ;
and as [???] had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several
years [???] [???] gathered all the news he could . elves [???] who seldom walked in the
shire [???] could now be seen passing westward through the woods in the evening [???]
passing and not returning ; but they were leaving middle - earth and were no
longer concerned with its troubles . there were [???] however [???] [???] on the road
in unusual numbers . the ancient east - west road ran through the shire to its
end at the grey havens [???] and [???] had always used it on their way to their
mines in the blue mountains . they were the [???] ' chief source of news
from distant parts - if they wanted any : as a rule [???] said little and
[???] asked no more . but now [???] often met strange [???] of far
countries [???] seeking [???] in the west . they were troubled [???] and some spoke in

whispers of the enemy and of the land of [???] .
that name the [???] only knew in [???] of the dark past [???] like a
shadow in the background of their memories ; but it was [???] and
[???] . it seemed that the evil power in [???] had been driven out
by the white council only to reappear in greater strength in the old
[???] of [???] . the dark tower had been rebuilt [???] it was said . from
there the power was spreading far and wide [???] and away far east and south
there were wars and growing fear . [???] were [???] again in the
mountains . [???] were abroad [???] no longer dull - witted [???] but cunning and armed
with dreadful weapons . and there were murmured hints of creatures more
terrible than all these [???] but they had no name .
little of all this [???] of course [???] reached the ears of ordinary [???] .
but even the deafest and most stay - at - home began to hear queer tales ; and
those whose business took them to the borders saw strange things . the
conversation in the green dragon at bywater [???] one evening in the spring of
[???] ' s [???] year [???] showed that even in the comfortable heart of the
shire rumours had been heard [???] though most [???] still laughed at them .
sam [???] was sitting in one corner near the fire [???] and opposite him
was ted sandyman [???] the miller ' s son ; and there were various other rustic
[???] listening to their talk .
' queer things you do hear these days [???] to be sure [???] ' said sam .
' ah [???] ' said ted [???] ' you do [???] if you listen . but i can hear fireside - tales
and children ' s stories at home [???] if i want to . '
' no doubt you can [???] ' retorted sam [???] ' and i daresay there ' s more truth in
some of them than you reckon . who invented the stories anyway ? take
dragons
now . '
' no thank ' ee [???] ' said ted [???] ' i won ' t . i heard tell of them when i was a
youngster [???] but there ' s no call to believe in them now . there ' s only one
dragon in bywater [???] and that ' s green [???] ' he said [???] getting a general laugh .
' all right [???] ' said sam [???] laughing with the rest . ' but what about these
tree - men [???] these giants [???] as you might call them ? they do say that one bigger
than a tree was seen up away beyond the north moors not long back . '
' who ' s they ? '
' my cousin hal for one . he works for mr . [???] at [???] and goes up
to the [???] for the hunting . he saw one . '
' says he did [???] perhaps . your hal ' s always saying he ' s seen things ; and

maybe he sees things that ain ' t there . '
' but this one was as big as an elm tree [???] and walking - walking seven
yards to a stride [???] if it was an inch . '
' then i bet it wasn ' t an inch . what he saw was an elm tree [???] as like as
not . '
' but this one was walking [???] i tell you ; and there ain ' t no elm tree on
the north moors . '
' then hal can ' t have seen one [???] ' said ted . there was some laughing and
clapping : the audience seemed to think that ted had scored a point .
' all the same [???] ' said sam [???] ' you can ' t deny that others besides our
halfast have seen queer folk crossing the shire - crossing it [???] mind you :
there are more that are turned back at the borders . the bounders have never
been so busy before .
' and i ' ve heard tell that elves are moving west . they do say they are
going to the harbours [???] out away beyond the white towers . ' sam waved his
arm
vaguely : neither he nor any of them knew how far it was to the sea [???] past the
old towers beyond the western borders of the shire . but it was an old
tradition that away over there stood the grey havens [???] from which at times
elven - ships set sail [???] never to return .
' they are sailing [???] sailing [???] sailing over the sea [???] they are going into
the west and leaving us [???] ' said sam [???] half chanting the words [???] shaking his
head sadly and solemnly . but ted laughed .
' well [???] that isn ' t anything new [???] if you believe the old tales . and i
don ' t see what it matters to me or you . let them sail ! but i warrant you
haven ' t seen them doing it ; nor any one else in the shire . '
' well i don ' t know [???] ' said sam thoughtfully . he believed he had once
seen an elf in the woods [???] and still hoped to see more one day . of all the
[???] that he had heard in his early years such fragments of tales and
half - remembered stories about the elves as the [???] knew [???] had always
moved him most deeply . ' there are some [???] even in these parts [???] as know the
fair folk and get news of them [???] ' he said . ' there ' s mr . [???] now [???] that i
work for . he told me that they were sailing and he knows a bit about elves .
and old mr . [???] knew more : many ' s the talk i had with him when i was a
little lad . '
' oh [???] they ' re both cracked [???] ' said ted . ' leastways old [???] was cracked [???]
and [???] ' s cracking . if that ' s where you get your news from [???] you ' ll never

want for moonshine . well [???] friends [???] i ' m off home . your good health ! ' he
drained his mug and went out noisily .
sam sat silent and said no more . he had a good deal to think about . for
one thing [???] there was a lot to do up in the bag end garden [???] and he would have
a busy day tomorrow [???] if the weather cleared . the grass was growing fast . but
sam ha d more on his mind than gardening . after a while he sighed [???] and got up
and went out .
it was early april and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain . the
sun was down [???] and a cool pale evening was quietly fading into night . he
walked home under the early stars through [???] and up the hill [???]
whistling softly and thoughtfully .
it was just at this time that [???] reappeared after his long
absence . for three years after the party he had been away . then he paid
[???] a brief visit [???] and after taking a good look at him he went off again .
during the next year or two he had turned up fairly often [???] coming
[???] after [???] [???] and going off without warning before [???] . he
would not discuss his own business and journeys [???] and seemed chiefly
interested in small news about [???] ' s health and doings .
then suddenly his visits had ceased . it was over nine years since [???]
had seen or heard of him [???] and he had begun to think that the [???] would
never return and had given up all interest in [???] . but that evening [???] as
sam was walking home and [???] was fading [???] there came the once familiar
tap on the study window .
[???] welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight . they
looked hard at one another .
' ah well eh ? ' said [???] . ' you look the same as ever [???] [???] ! '
' so do you [???] ' [???] replied ; but secretly he thought that [???] looked
older and more [???] . he pressed him for news of himself and of the wide
world [???] and soon they were deep in talk [???] and they stayed up far into the
night .
next morning after a late breakfast [???] the [???] was sitting with [???]
by the open window of the study . a bright fire was on the hearth [???] but the
sun was warm [???] and the wind was in the south . everything looked fresh [???] and
the new green of spring was [???] in the fields and on the tips of the
trees ' fingers .
[???] was thinking of a spring [???] nearly eighty years before [???] when
[???] had run out of bag end without a handkerchief . his hair was perhaps

whiter than it had been then [???] and his beard and eyebrows were perhaps
longer [???] and his face more lined with care and wisdom ; but his eyes were as
bright as ever [???] and he smoked and blew smoke - rings with the same vigour and
delight .
he was smoking now in silence [???] for [???] was sitting still [???] deep in
thought . even in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow of the tidings
that [???] had brought . at last he broke the silence .
' last night you began to tell me strange things about my ring [???]
[???] [???] ' he said . ' and then you stopped [???] because you said that such matters
were best left until daylight . don ' t you think you had better finish now ?
you say the ring is dangerous [???] far mor e dangerous than i guess . in what
way ? '
' in many ways [???] ' answered the [???] . it is far more powerful than i
ever dared to think at first [???] so powerful that in the end it would utterly
overcome anyone of mortal race who possessed it . it would possess him .
' in [???] long ago many elven - rings were made [???] magic rings as you
call them [???] and they were [???] of course [???] of various kinds : some more potent and
some less . the lesser rings were only essays in the craft before it was
full - grown [???] and to the elven - smiths they were but trifles - yet still to my
mind dangerous for mortals . but the great rings [???] the rings of power [???] they
were perilous .
' a mortal [???] [???] [???] who keeps one of the great rings [???] does not die [???] but
he does not grow or obtain more life [???] he merely continues [???] until at last
every minute is a weariness . and if he often uses the ring to make himself
invisible [???] he fades : he becomes in the end invisible permanently [???] and walks
in the [???] under the eye of the dark power that rules the rings . yes [???]
sooner or later - later [???] if he is strong or well - meaning to begin with [???] but
neither strength nor good purpose will last - sooner or later the dark power
will devour him . '
' how terrifying ! ' said [???] . there was another long silence . the sound
of sam [???] cutting the lawn came in from the garden .
' how long have you known this ? ' asked [???] at length . ' and how much
did [???] know ? '
' [???] knew no more than he told you [???] i am sure [???] ' said [???] . ' he
would certainly never have passed on to you anything that he thought would
be a danger [???] even though i promised to look after you . he thought the ring
was very beautiful [???] and very useful at need ; and if anything was wrong or

queer [???] it was himself . he said that it was [???] growing on his mind [???] [???] and he was
always [???] about it ; but he did not suspect that the ring itself was to
blame . though he had found out that the thing needed looking after ; it did
not seem always of the same size or weight ; it shrank or [???] in an odd
way [???] and might suddenly slip off a finger where it had been tight . '
' yes [???] he warned me of that in his last letter [???] ' said [???] [???] ' so i have
always kept it on its chain . '
' very wise [???] ' said [???] . ' but as for his long life [???] [???] never
connected it with the ring at all . he took all the credit for that to
himself [???] and he was very proud of it . though he was getting restless and
uneasy . thin and stretched he said . a sign that the ring was getting
control . '
' how long have you known all this ? ' asked [???] again .
' known ? ' said [???] . ' i have known much that only the wise know [???]
[???] . but if you mean [???] known about this ring [???] [???] well [???] i still do not know [???]
one might say . there is a last test to make . but i no longer doubt my guess .
' when did i first begin to guess ? ' he mused [???] searching back in memory .
' let me see - it was in the year that the white council drove the dark power
from [???] [???] just before the battle of five armies [???] that [???] found his
ring . a shadow fell on my heart then [???] though i did not know yet what i
feared . i wondered often how [???] came by a great ring [???] as plainly it was
- that at least was clear from the first . then i heard [???] ' s strange story
of how he had [???] won [???] it [???] and i could not believe it . when i at last got the
truth out of him [???] i saw at once that he had been trying to put his claim to
the ring beyond doubt . much like [???] with his [???] birthday present [???] . the
lies were too much alike for my comfort . clearly the ring had an unwholesome
power that set to work on its keeper at once . that was the first real
warning i had that all was not well . i told [???] often that such rings were
better left unused ; but he resented it [???] and soon got angry . there was little
else that i could do . i could not take it from him without doing greater
harm ; and i had no right to do so anyway . i could only watch and wait . i
might perhaps have consulted [???] the white [???] but something always held
me
back . '
' who is he ? ' asked [???] . i have never heard of him before . '
' maybe not [???] ' answered [???] . ' [???] are [???] or were [???] no concern of
his . yet he is great among the wise . he is the chief of my order and the

head of the council . his knowledge is deep [???] but his pride has grown with it [???]
and he takes ill any meddling . the lore of the elven - rings [???] great and small [???]
is his province . he has long studied it [???] seeking the lost secrets of their
making ; but when the rings were debated in the council [???] all that he would
reveal to us of his ring - lore told against my fears . so my doubt slept - but
[???] . still i watched and i waited .
' and all seemed well with [???] . and the years passed . yes [???] they
passed [???] and they seemed not to touch him . he showed no signs of age . the
shadow fell on me again . but i said to myself : [???] after all he comes of a
long - lived family on his mother ' s side . there is time yet . wait ! [???]
' and i waited . until that night when he left this house . he said and
did things then that filled me with a fear that no words of [???] could
allay . i knew at last that something dark and deadly was at work . and i have
spent most of the years since then in finding out the truth of it . '
' there wasn ' t any permanent harm done [???] was there ? ' asked [???]
anxiously . ' he would get all right in time [???] wouldn ' t he ? be able to rest in
peace [???] i mean ? '
' he felt better at once [???] ' said [???] . ' but there is only one power in
this world that knows all about the rings and their effects ; and as far as i
know there is no power in the world that knows all about [???] . among the
wise i am the only one that goes in for hobbit - lore : an obscure branch of
knowledge [???] but full of surprises . soft as butter they can be [???] and yet
sometimes as tough as old tree - roots . i think it likely that some would
resist the rings far longer than most of the wise would believe . i don ' t
think you need worry about [???] .
' of course [???] he possessed the ring for many years [???] and used it [???] so it
might take a long while for the influence to wear off - before it was safe
for him to see it again [???] for instance . otherwise [???] he might live on for
years [???] quite happily : just stop as he was when he parted with it . for he
gave it up in the end of his own accord : an important point . no [???] i was not
troubled about dear [???] any more [???] once he had let the thing go . it is for
you that i feel responsible .
' ever since [???] left i have been deeply concerned about you [???] and
about all these charming [???] absurd [???] helpless [???] . it would be a grievous
blow to the world [???] if the dark power overcame the shire ; if all your kind [???]
jolly [???] stupid [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] and the rest [???] not
to mention the ridiculous [???] [???] became [???] . '

[???] [???] . ' but why should we be ? ' he asked . ' and why should he
want such slaves ? '
' to tell you the truth [???] ' replied [???] [???] ' i believe that hitherto -
hitherto [???] mark you - he has entirely overlooked the existence of [???] .
you should be thankful . but your safety has passed . he does not need you -
he has many more useful servants - but he won ' t forget you again . and
[???] as miserable slaves would please him far more than [???] happy and
free . there is such a thing as malice and revenge . '
' revenge ? ' said [???] . ' revenge for what ? i still don ' t understand what
all this has to do with [???] and myself [???] and our ring . '
' it has everything to do with it [???] ' said [???] . ' you do not know the
real peril yet ; but you shall . i was not sure of it myself when i was last
here ; but the time has come to speak . give me the ring for a moment . '
[???] took it from his breeches - pocket [???] where it was clasped to a chain
that hung from his belt . he [???] it and handed it slowly to the
[???] . it felt suddenly very heavy [???] as if either it or [???] himself was in
some way [???] for [???] to touch it .
[???] held it up . it looked to be made of pure and solid gold . ' can
you see any markings on it ? ' he asked .
' no [???] ' said [???] . ' there are none . it is quite plain [???] and it never
shows a scratch or sign of wear . '
' well then [???] look ! ' to [???] ' s astonishment and distress the [???]
threw it suddenly into the middle of a glowing corner of the fire . [???]
gave a cry and groped for the tongs ; but [???] held him back .
' wait ! ' he said in a commanding voice [???] giving [???] a quick look from
under his [???] brows .
no apparent change came over the ring . after a while [???] got up [???]
closed the shutters outside the window [???] and drew the curtains . the room
became dark and silent [???] though the clack of sam ' s shears [???] now nearer to the
windows [???] could still be heard faintly from the garden . for a moment the
[???] st ood looking at the fire ; then he stooped and removed the ring to
the hearth with the tongs [???] and at once picked it up . [???] gasped .
it is quite cool [???] ' said [???] . ' take it ! ' [???] received it on his
shrinking palm : it seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever .
' hold it up ! ' said [???] . ' and look closely ! '
as [???] did so [???] he now saw fine lines [???] finer than the finest
pen - strokes [???] running along the ring [???] outside and inside : lines of fire that

seemed to form the letters of a flowing script . they shone piercingly
bright [???] and yet remote [???] as if out of a great depth .

i cannot read the fiery letters [???] ' said [???] in a [???] voice .
' no [???] ' said [???] [???] ' but i can . the letters are elvish [???] of an ancient
mode [???] but the language is that of [???] [???] which i will not utter here . but
this in the common tongue is what is said [???] close enough :
one ring to rule them all [???] one ring to find them [???]
one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them .
it is only two lines of a verse long known in elven - lore :
three rings for the elven - kings under the sky [???]
seven for the dwarf - lords in their halls of stone [???]
nine for mortal men doomed to die [???]
one for the dark lord on his dark throne
in the land of [???] where the shadows lie .
one ring to rule them all . one ring to find them [???]
one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
in the land of [???] where the shadows lie . '
he paused [???] and then said slowly in a deep voice : ' this is the
master - ring [???] the one ring to rule them all . this is the one ring that he
lost many ages ago [???] to the great weakening of his power . he greatly desires
it - but he must not get it . '
[???] sat silent and motionless . fear seemed to stretch out a vast
hand [???] like a dark cloud rising in the east and looming up to engulf him .
' this ring ! ' he [???] . ' how [???] how on earth did it come to me ? '
' ah ! ' said [???] . ' that is a very long story . the beginnings lie back
in the black years [???] which only the lore - masters now remember . if i were to
tell you all that tale [???] we should still be sitting here when spring had
passed into winter .
' but last night i told you of [???] the great [???] the dark lord . the
rumours that you have heard are true : he has indeed arisen again and left
his hold in [???] and returned to his ancient fastness in the dark tower
of [???] . that name even you [???] have heard of [???] like a shadow on the
borders of old stories . always after a defeat and a respite [???] the shadow
takes another shape and grows again . '
' i wish it need not have happened in my time [???] ' said [???] .
' so do i [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and so do all who live to see such times . but

that is not for them to decide . all we have to decide is what to do with the
time that is given [???] us . and already [???] [???] [???] our time is beginning to look
black . the enemy is fast becoming very strong . his plans are far from ripe [???]
i think [???] but they are ripening . we shall be hard put to it . we should be
very hard put to it [???] even if it were not for this dreadful chance .
' the enemy still lacks one thing to give him strength and knowledge to
beat down all resistance [???] break the last defences [???] and cover all the lands
in a second darkness . he lacks the one ring .
' the three [???] fairest of all [???] the elf - lords hid from him [???] and his hand
never touched them or sullied them . seven the dwarf - kings possessed [???] but
three he has recovered [???] and the others the dragons have consumed . nine he
gave to mortal men [???] proud and great [???] and so [???] them . long ago they
fell under the dominion of the one [???] and they became [???] [???] shadows
under his great shadow [???] his most terrible servants . long ago . it is many a
year since the nine walked abroad . yet who knows ? as the shadow grows
once
more [???] they too may walk again . but come ! we will not speak of such things
even in the morning of the shire .
' so it is now : the nine he has gathered to himself ; the seven also [???] or
else they are destroyed . the three are hidden still . but that no longer
troubles him . he only needs the one ; for he made that ring himself [???] it is
his [???] and he let a great part of his own former power pass into it [???] so that
he could rule all the other s . if he recovers it [???] then he will command them
all again [???] wherever they be [???] even the three [???] and all that has been wrought
with them will be laid bare [???] and he will be stronger than ever .
' and this is the dreadful chance [???] [???] . he believed that the one had
perished ; that the elves had destroyed it [???] as should have been done . but he
knows now that it has not perished [???] that it has been found . so he is seeking
it [???] seeking it [???] and all his thought is bent on it . it is his great hope and
our great fear . '
' why [???] why wasn ' t it destroyed ? ' cried [???] . ' and how did the enemy
ever come to lose it [???] if he was so strong [???] and it was so precious to him ? '
he clutched the ring in his hand [???] as if he saw already dark fingers
stretching out to seize it .
' it was taken from him [???] ' said [???] . ' the strength of the elves to
resist him was greater long ago ; and not all men were [???] from them .
the men of westernesse came to their aid . that is a chapter of ancient

history which it might be good to recall ; for there was sorrow then too [???] and
gathering dark [???] but great valour [???] and great deeds that were not wholly vain .
one day [???] perhaps [???] i will tell you all the tale [???] or you shall hear it told in
full by one who knows it best .
' but for the moment [???] since most of all you need to know how this thing
came to you [???] and that will be tale enough [???] this is all that i will say . it
was gil - [???] [???] elven - king and [???] of westernesse who overthrew [???] [???]
though they themselves perished in the deed ; and [???] [???] ' s son cut
the ring from [???] ' s hand and took it for his own . then [???] was
vanquished and his spirit fled and was hidden for long years [???] until his
shadow took shape again in [???] .
' but the ring was lost . it fell into the great river [???] [???] [???] and
vanished . for [???] was marching north along the east banks of the river [???]
and near the gladden fields he was [???] by the [???] of the mountains [???] and
almost all his folk were slain . he leaped into the waters [???] but the ring
slipped from his finger as he swam [???] and then the [???] saw him and killed him
with arrows . '
[???] paused . ' and there in the dark [???] amid the gladden fields [???] '
he said [???] ' the ring passed out of knowledge and legend ; and even so much of
its history is known now only to a few [???] and the council of the wise could
discover no more . but at last i can carry on the story [???] i think .
' long after [???] but still very long ago [???] there lived by the banks of the
great river on the edge of wilderland a clever - handed and quiet - footed
little people . i guess they were of hobbit - kind ; akin to the fathers of the
fathers of the stoors [???] for they loved the river [???] and often swam in it [???] or
made little boats of reeds . there was among them a family of high repute [???]
for it was large and wealthier than most [???] and it was ruled by a [???]
of the folk [???] stern and wise in old lore [???] such as they had . the most
[???] and curious - minded of that family was called [???] . he was
interested in roots and beginnings ; he dived into deep [???] ; he [???]
under trees and growing plants ; he [???] into green mounds ; and he
ceased to look up at the hill - tops [???] or the leaves on trees [???] or the flowers
opening in the air : his head and his eyes were downward .
' he had a friend called [???] [???] of similar sort [???] sharper - eyed but not
so quick and strong . on a time they took a boat and went down to the gladden
fields [???] where there were great beds of iris and flowering reeds . there
[???] got out and went nosing about the banks but deal sat in the boat and

fished . suddenly a great fish took his hook [???] and before he knew where he
was [???] he was dragged out and down into the water [???] to the bottom . then he let
go of his line [???] for he thought he saw something shining in the river - bed ;
and holding his breath he [???] at it .
' then up he came [???] [???] with weeds in his hair and a handful of
mud ; and he swam to the bank . and behold ! when he washed the mud away [???]
there
in his hand lay a beautiful golden ring ; and it shone and glittered in the
sun [???] so that his heart was glad . but [???] had been watching him from
behind a tree [???] and as deal gloated over the ring [???] [???] came softly up
behind .
' [???] give us that [???] deal [???] my love [???] [???] said [???] [???] over his friend ' s
shoulder .
' [???] why ? [???] said deal .
' [???] because it ' s my birthday [???] my love [???] and i wants it [???] [???] said [???] .
' [???] i don ' t care [???] [???] said deal . [???] i have given you a present already [???] more
than i could afford . i found this [???] and i ' m going to keep it . [???]
' [???] oh [???] are you indeed [???] my love [???] [???] said [???] ; and he caught deal by
the throat and strangled him [???] because the gold looked so bright and
beautiful . then he put the ring on his finger .
' no one ever found out what had become of deal ; he was murdered far
from home [???] and his body was cunningly hidden . but [???] returned alone ;
and he found that none of his family could see him [???] when he was wearing the
ring . he was very pleased with his discovery and he concealed it ; and he
used it to find out secrets [???] and he put his knowledge to crooked and
malicious uses . he became sharp - eyed and keen - eared for all that was
hurtful . the ring had given him power according to his stature . it is not to
be wondered at that he became very [???] and was shunned ( when
visible )
by all his relations . they kicked him [???] and he bit their feet . he took to
thieving [???] and going about muttering to himself [???] and [???] in his throat .
so they called him [???] [???] and cursed him [???] and told him to go far away ; and
his [???] [???] desiring peace [???] [???] him from the family and turned him
out of her hole .
' he wandered in loneliness [???] weeping a little for the hardness of the
world [???] and he journeyed up the river [???] till he came to a stream that flowed
down from the mountains [???] and he went that way . he caught fish in deep [???]

with invisible fingers and ate them raw . one day it was very hot [???] and as he
was bending over a pool [???] he felt a burning on the back of his head ) and a
[???] light from the water pained his wet eyes . he wondered at it [???] for he
had almost forgotten about the sun . then for the last time he looked up and
shook his fist at her .
' but as he lowered his eyes [???] he saw far above the tops of the misty
mountains [???] out of which the stream came . and he thought suddenly : [???] it would
be cool and shady under those mountains . the sun could not watch me there .
the roots of those mountains must be roots indeed ; there must be great
secrets buried there which have not been discovered since the beginning . [???]
' so he journeyed by night up into the [???] [???] and he found a little
cave out of which the dark stream ran ; and he wormed his way like a [???]
into the heart of the hills [???] and vanished out of all knowledge . the ring
went into the shadows with him [???] and even the maker [???] when his power had
begun
to grow again [???] could learn nothing of it . '
' [???] ! ' cried [???] . ' [???] ? do you mean that this is the very
[???] - creature that [???] met ? how loathsome ! '
' i think it is a sad story [???] ' said the [???] [???] ' and it might have
happened to others [???] even to some [???] that i have known . '
' i can ' t believe that [???] was connected with [???] [???] however
distantly [???] ' said [???] with some heat . ' what an abominable notion ! '
' it is true all the same [???] ' replied [???] . ' about their origins [???] at
any rate [???] i know more than [???] do themselves . and even [???] ' s story
suggests the kinship . there was a great deal in the background of their
minds and memories that was very similar . they understood one another
remarkably well [???] very much better than a hobbit would understand [???] say [???] a
dwarf [???] or an orc [???] or even an elf . think of the [???] they both knew [???] for
one thing . '
' yes [???] ' said [???] . ' though other folks besides [???] ask [???] [???] and
of much the same sort . and [???] don ' t cheat . [???] meant to cheat all
the time . he was just trying to put poor [???] off his guard . and i daresay
it amused his wickedness to start a game which might end in providing him
with an easy victim [???] but if he lost would not hurt him . '
' only too true [???] i fear [???] ' said [???] . ' but there was something else in
it [???] i think [???] which you don ' t see yet . even [???] was not wholly ruined . he
had proved tougher than even one of the wise would have guessed - as a hobbit

might . there was a little corner of his mind that was still his own [???] and
light came through it [???] as through a chink in the dark : light out of the
past . it was actually pleasant [???] i think [???] to hear a kindly voice again [???]
bringing up memories of wind [???] and trees [???] and sun on the grass [???] and such
forgotten things .
' but that [???] of course [???] would only make the evil part of him angrier in
the end - unless it could be conquered . unless it could be cured . ' [???]
sighed . ' alas ! there is little hope of that for him . yet not no hope . no [???]
not though he possessed the ring so long [???] almost as far back as he can
remember . for it was long since he had worn it much : in the black darkness
it was seldom needed . certainly he had never [???] faded [???] . he is thin and tough
still . but the thing was eating up his mind [???] of course [???] and the torment had
become almost [???] .
' all the [???] great secrets [???] under the mountains had turned out to be just
empty night : there was nothing more to find out [???] nothing worth doing [???] only
[???] [???] eating and [???] remembering . he was altogether wretched .
he hated the dark [???] and he hated light more : he hated everything [???] and the
ring most of all . '
' what do you mean ? ' said [???] . ' surely the ring was his precious and
the only thing he cared for ? but if he hated it [???] why didn ' t he get rid of
it [???] or go away and leave it ? '
' you ought to begin to understand [???] [???] [???] after all you have heard [???] '
said [???] . ' he hated it and loved it [???] as he hated and loved himself . he
could not get rid of it . he had no will left in the matter .
' a ring of power looks after itself [???] [???] . it may slip off
treacherously [???] but its keeper never abandons it . at most he plays with the
idea of handing it on to someone else ' s care - and that only at an early
stage [???] when it first begins to grip . but as far as i know [???] alone in
history has ever gone beyond playing [???] and really done it . he needed all my
help [???] too . and even so he would never have just forsaken it [???] or cast it
aside . it was not [???] [???] [???] [???] but the ring itself that decided things .
the ring left him . '
' what [???] just in time to meet [???] ? ' said [???] . ' wouldn ' t an orc have
suited it better ? '
' it is no laughing matter [???] ' said [???] . ' not for you . it was the
strangest event in the whole history of the ring so far : [???] ' s arrival
just at that time [???] and putting his hand on it [???] blindly [???] in the dark .

' there was more than one power at work [???] [???] . the ring was trying to
get back to its master . it had slipped from [???] ' s hand and betrayed him ;
then when a chance came it caught poor deal [???] and he was murdered ; and after
that [???] [???] and it had devoured him . it could make no further use of him :
he was too small and mean ; and as long as it stayed with him he would never
leave his deep pool again . so now [???] when its master was awake once more and
sending out his dark thought from [???] [???] it abandoned [???] . only to
be
picked up by the most unlikely person imaginable : [???] from the shire !
' behind that there was something else at work [???] beyond any design of the
ring - maker . i can put it no plainer than by saying that [???] was meant to
find the ring [???] and not by its maker . in which case you also were meant to
have it . and that maybe an encouraging thought . '
it is not [???] ' said [???] . [???] though i am not sure that i understand you .
but how have you learned all this about the ring [???] and about [???] ? do you
really know it all [???] or are you just guessing still ? '
[???] looked at [???] [???] and his eyes glinted . i knew much and i have
learned much [???] ' he answered . ' but i am not going to give an account of all my
doings to you . the history of [???] and [???] and the one ring is known
to all the wise . your ring is shown to be that one ring by the fire - writing
alone [???] apart from any other evidence . ' ' and when did you discover that ? '
asked [???] [???] interrupting . ' just now in this room [???] of course [???] ' answered the
[???] sharply . ' but i expected to find it . i have come back from dark
journeys and long search to make that final test . it is the last proof [???] and
all is now only too clear . making out [???] ' s part [???] and fitting it into the
gap in the history [???] required some thought . i may have started with guesses
about [???] [???] but i am not guessing now . i know . i have seen him . '
' you have seen [???] ? ' exclaimed [???] in amazement .
' yes . the obvious thing to do [???] of course [???] if one could . i tried long
ago ; but i have managed it at last . '
' then what happened after [???] escaped from him ? do you know that ? '
' not so clearly . what i have told you is what [???] was willing to
tell - though not [???] of course [???] in the way i have reported it . [???] is a
liar [???] and you have to sift his words . for instance [???] he called the ring his
[???] birthday present [???] [???] and he stuck to that . he said it came from his
[???] [???] who had lots of beautiful things of that kind . a ridiculous
story . i have no doubt that [???] ' s [???] was a [???] [???] a great

person in her way [???] but to talk of her possessing many elven - rings was
absurd [???] and as for giving them away [???] it was a lie . but a lie with a grain of
truth .
' the murder of deal haunted [???] [???] and he had made up a defence [???]
repeating it to his [???] precious [???] over and over again [???] as he gnawed bones in
the dark [???] until he almost believed it . it was his birthday . deal ought to
have given the ring to him . it had previously turned up just so as to be a
present . it was his birthday present [???] and so on [???] and on .
i endured him as long as i could [???] but the truth was desperately
important [???] and in the end i had to be harsh . i put the fear of fire on him [???]
and wrung the true story out of him [???] bit by bit [???] together with much
[???] and [???] . he thought he was [???] and ill - used . but
when he had at last told me his history [???] as far as the end of the
riddle - game and [???] ' s escape [???] he would not say any more [???] except in dark
hints . some other fear was on him greater than mine . he muttered that he was
going to gel his own back . people would see if he would stand being kicked [???]
and driven into a hole and then robbed . [???] had good friends now [???] good
friends and very strong . they would help him . [???] would pay for it . that
was his chief thought . he hated [???] and cursed his name . what is more [???] he
knew where he came from . '
' but how did he find that out ? ' asked [???] .
' well [???] as for the name [???] [???] very foolishly told [???] himself ; and
after that it would not be difficult to discover his country [???] once [???]
came out . oh yes [???] he came out . his longing for the ring proved stronger than
his fear of the [???] [???] or even of the light . after a year or two he left the
mountains . you see [???] though still bound by desire of it [???] the ring was no
longer devouring him ; he began to revive a little . he felt old [???] terribly
old [???] yet less timid [???] and he was mortally hungry .
' light [???] light of sun and moon [???] he still feared and hated [???] and he always
will [???] i think ; but he was cunning . he found he could hide from daylight and
moonshine [???] and make his way swiftly and softly by dead of night with his
pale cold eyes [???] and catch small frightened or unwary things . he grew
stronger and bolder with new food and new air . he found his way into
[???] [???] as one would expect . '
' is that where you found him ? ' asked [???] .
' i saw him there [???] ' answered [???] [???] ' but before that he had wandered
far [???] following [???] ' s trail . it was difficult to learn anything from him

for certain [???] for his talk was constantly interrupted by curses and threats .
[???] what had it got in its pocketses ? [???] he said . [???] it wouldn ' t say [???] no precious .
little cheat . not a fair question . it cheated first [???] it did . it broke the
rules . we ought to have [???] it [???] yes precious . and we will [???] precious ! [???]
' that is a [???] of his talk . i don ' t suppose you want any more . i had
weary days of it . but from hints dropped among the [???] i even gathered
that his padding feet had taken him at last to [???] [???] and even to the
streets of dale [???] listening secretly and peering . well [???] the news of the great
events went far and wide in wilderland [???] and many had heard [???] ' s name and
knew where he came from . we had made no secret of our return journey to his
home in the west . [???] ' s sharp ears would soon learn what he wanted . '
' then why didn ' t he track [???] further ? ' asked [???] . ' why didn ' t he
come to the shire ? '
' ah [???] ' said [???] [???] ' now we come to it . i think [???] tried to . he set
out and came back westward [???] as far as the great river . but then he turned
aside . he was not [???] by the distance [???] i am sure . no [???] something else
drew him away . so my friends think [???] those that hunted him for me .
' the wood - elves tracked him first [???] an easy task for them [???] for his trail
was still fresh then . through [???] and back again it led them [???] though
they never caught him . the wood was full of the rumour of him [???] dreadful
tales even among beasts and birds . the woodmen said that there was some
new
terror abroad [???] a ghost that drank blood . it climbed trees to find nests ; it
crept into holes to find the young ; it slipped through windows to find
cradles .
' but at the western edge of [???] the trail turned away . it wandered
off southwards and passed out of the wood - elves ' ken [???] and was lost . and then
i made a great mistake . yes [???] [???] [???] and not the first ; though i fear it may
prove the worst . i let the matter be . i let him go ; for i had much else to
think of at that time [???] and i still trusted the lore of [???] .
' well [???] that was years ago . i have paid for it since with many dark and
dangerous days . the trail was long cold when i took it up again [???] after [???]
left here . and my search would have been in vain [???] but for the help that i
had from a friend : [???] [???] the greatest traveller and huntsman of this age
of the world . together we sought for [???] down the whole length of
wilderland [???] without hope [???] and without success . but at last [???] when i had given
up the chase and turned to other parts [???] [???] was found . my friend returned

out of the great perils bringing the miserable creature with him .
' what he had been doing he would not say . he only wept and called us
cruel [???] with many a [???] in his throat ; and when we pressed him he whined
and [???] [???] and rubbed his long hands [???] licking his fingers as if they
pained him [???] as if he remembered some old torture . but i am afraid there is
no possible doubt : he had made his slow [???] sneaking way [???] step by step [???] mile by
mile [???] south [???] down at last to the land of [???] . '
a heavy silence fell in the room . [???] could hear his heart beating .
even outside everything seemed still . no sound of sam ' s shears could now be
heard .
' yes [???] to [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' alas ! [???] draws all wicked things [???]
and the dark power was bending all its will to gather them there . the ring
of the enemy would leave its mark [???] too [???] leave him open to the summons . and
all folk were whispering then of the new shadow in the south [???] and its hatred
of the west . there were his fine new friends [???] who would help him in his
revenge !
' wretched fool ! in that land he would learn much [???] too much for his
comfort . and sooner or later as he lurked and pried on the borders he would
be caught [???] and taken - for examination . that was the way of it [???] i fear . when
he was found he had already been there long [???] and was on his way back . on
some errand of mischief . but that does not matter much now . his worst
mischief was done .
' yes [???] alas ! through him the enemy has learned that the one has been
found again . he knows where [???] fell . he knows where [???] found his
ring . he knows that it is a great ring [???] for it gave long life . he knows that
it is not one of the three [???] for they have never been lost [???] and they endure
no evil . he knows that it is not one of the seven [???] or the nine [???] for they are
accounted for . he knows that it is the one . and he has at last heard [???] i
think [???] of [???] and the shire .
' the shire - he may be seeking for it now [???] if he has not already found
out where it lies . indeed [???] [???] [???] i fear that he may even think that the
long - [???] name of [???] has become important . '
' but this is terrible ! ' cried [???] . ' far worse than the worst that i
imagined from your hints and warnings . o [???] [???] best of friends [???] what am i
to do ? for now i am really afraid . what am i to do ? what a pity that [???]
did not stab that vile creature [???] when he had a chance ! '
' pity ? it was pity that stayed his hand . pity [???] and mercy : not to strike

without need . and he has been well rewarded [???] [???] . be sure that he took so
little hurt from the evil [???] and escaped in the end [???] because he began his
ownership of the ring so . with pity . '
' i am sorry [???] ' said [???] . ' but i am frightened ; and i do not feel any
pity for [???] . '
' you have not seen him [???] ' [???] broke in .
' no [???] and i don ' t want to [???] ' said [???] . i can ' t understand you . do you
mean to say that you [???] and the elves [???] have let him live on after all those
horrible deeds ? now at any rate he is as bad as an orc [???] and just an enemy .
he deserves death . '
' deserves it ! i daresay he does . many that live deserve death . and some
that die deserve life . can you give it to them ? then do not be too eager to
deal out death in judgement . for even the very wise cannot see all ends . i
have not much hope that [???] can be cured before he dies [???] but there is a
chance of it . and he is bound up with the fate of the ring . my heart tells
me that he has some part to play yet [???] for good or ill [???] before the end ; and
when that comes [???] the pity of [???] may rule the fate of many - yours not
least . in any case we did not kill him : he is very old and very wretched .
the wood - elves have him in prison [???] but they treat him with such kindness as
they can find in their wise hearts . '
' all the same [???] ' said [???] [???] ' even if [???] could not kill [???] [???] i
wish he had not kept the ring . i wish he had never found it [???] and that i had
not got it ! why did you let me keep it ? why didn ' t you make me throw it
away [???] or [???] or destroy it ? '
' let you ? make you ? ' sa id the [???] . ' haven ' t you been listening to
all that i have said ? you are not thinking of what you are saying . but as
for throwing it away [???] that was obviously wrong . these rings have a way of
being found . in evil hands it might have done great evil . worst of all [???] it
might have fallen into the hands of the enemy . indeed it certainly would ;
for this is the one [???] and he is exerting all his power to find it or draw it
to himself .
' of course [???] my dear [???] [???] it was dangerous for you ; and that has
troubled me deeply . but there was so much at stake that i had to take some
risk - though even when i was far away there has never been a day when the
shire has not been guarded by watchful eyes . as long as you never used it [???] i
did not think that the ring would have any lasting effect on you [???] not for
evil [???] not at any rate for a very long time . and you must remember that nine

years ago [???] when i last saw you [???] i still knew little for certain . '
' but why not destroy it [???] as you say should have been done long ago ? '
cried [???] again . if you had warned me [???] or even sent me a message [???] i would
have done away with it . '
' would you ? how would you do that ? have you ever tried ? '
' no . but i suppose one could hammer it or melt it . '
' try ! ' said [???] . try now ! '
[???] drew the ring out of his pocket again and looked at it . it now
appeared plain and smooth [???] without mark or device that he could see . the
gold looked very fair and pure [???] and [???] thought how rich and beautiful was
its colour [???] how perfect was its roundness . it was an admirable thing and
altogether precious . when he took it out he had intended to fling it from
him into the very [???] part of the fire . but he found now that he could
not do so [???] not without a great struggle . he weighed the ring in his hand [???]
[???] [???] and forcing himself to remember all that [???] had told him ;
and then with an effort of will he made a movement [???] as if to cast it away -
but he found that he had put it back in his pocket .
[???] laughed grimly . ' you see ? already you too [???] [???] [???] cannot easily
let it go [???] nor will to damage it . and i could not [???] make [???] you - except by
force [???] which would break your mind . but as for breaking the ring [???] force is
useless . even if you took it and struck it with a heavy sledge - hammer [???] it
would make no dint in it . it cannot be unmade by your hands [???] or by mine .
' your small fire [???] of course [???] would not melt even ordinary gold . this
ring has already passed through it [???] [???] and even [???] . but there
is no smith ' s forge in this shire that could change it at all . not even the
[???] and furnaces of the [???] could do that . it has been said that
dragon - fire could melt and consume the rings of power [???] but there is not now
any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough ; nor was there
ever any dragon [???] not even [???] the black [???] who could have harmed the
one
ring [???] the ruling ring [???] for that was made by [???] himself . there is only
one way : to find the cracks of doom in the depths of [???] [???] the
fire - mountain [???] and cast the ring in there [???] if you really wish to destroy it [???]
to put it beyond the grasp of the enemy for ever . '
' i do really wish to destroy it ! ' cried [???] . ' or [???] well [???] to have it
destroyed . i am not made for perilous quests . i wish i had never seen the
ring ! why did it come to me ? why was i chosen ? '

' such questions cannot be answered [???] ' said [???] . ' you may be sure
that it was not for any merit that others do not possess : not for power or
wisdom [???] at any rate . but you have been chosen [???] and you must therefore use
such strength and heart and wits as you have . '
' but i have so little of any of these things ! you are wise and
powerful . will you not take the ring ? '
' no ! ' cried [???] [???] springing to his feet . ' with that power i should
have power too great and terrible . and over me the ring would gain a power
still greater and more deadly . ' his eyes flashed and his face was lit as by
a fire within . ' do not tempt me ! for i do not wish to become like the dark
lord himself . yet the way of the ring to my heart is by pity [???] pity for
weakness and the desire of strength to do good . do not tempt me ! i dare not
take it [???] not even to keep it safe [???] unused . the wish to wield it would be too
great [???] for my strength . i shall have such need of it . great perils lie
before me . '
he went to the window and drew aside the curtains and the shutters .
sunlight streamed back again into the room . sam passed along the path
outside whistling . ' and now [???] ' said the [???] [???] turning back to [???] [???] ' the
decision lies with you . but i will always help you . ' he laid his hand on
[???] ' s shoulder . ' i will help you bear this burden [???] as long as it is yours
to bear . but we must do something [???] soon . the enemy is moving . '
there was a long silence . [???] sat down again and puffed at his
pipe [???] as if lost in thought . his eyes seemed closed [???] but under the lids he
was watching [???] intently . [???] gazed fixedly at the red embers on the
hearth [???] until they filled all his vision [???] and he seemed to be looking down
into profound wells of fire . he was thinking of the fabled cracks of doom
and the terror of the fiery mountain .
' well ! ' said [???] at last . ' what are you thinking about ? have you
decided what to do ? '
' no ! ' answered [???] [???] coming back to himself out of darkness [???] and
finding to his surprise that it was not dark [???] and that out of the window he
could see the [???] garden . ' or perhaps [???] yes . as far as i understand what
you have said [???] i suppose i must keep the ring and guard it [???] at least for the
present [???] whatever it may do to me . '
' whatever it may do [???] it will be slow [???] slow to evil [???] if you keep it with
that purpose [???] ' said [???] .
' i hope so [???] ' said [???] . ' but i hope that you may find some other

better keeper soon . but in the meanwhile it seems that i am a danger [???] a
danger to all that live near me . i cannot keep the ring and stay here . i
ought to leave bag end [???] leave the shire [???] leave everything and go away . ' he
sighed .
' i should like to save the shire [???] if i could - though there have been
times when i thought the inhabitants too stupid and dull for words [???] and have
felt that an [???] or an invasion of dragons might be good for them .
but i don ' t feel like that now . i feel that as long as the shire lies
behind [???] safe and comfortable [???] i shall find wandering more bearable : i shall
know that somewhere there is a firm foothold [???] even if my feet cannot stand
there again .
' of course [???] i have sometimes thought of going away [???] but i imagined that
as a kind of holiday [???] a series of adventures like [???] ' s or better [???] ending
in peace . but this would mean exile [???] a flight from danger into danger [???]
drawing it after me . and i suppose i must go alone [???] if i am to do that and
save the shire . but i feel very small [???] and very [???] [???] and well -
desperate . the enemy is so strong and terrible . '
he did not tell [???] [???] but as he was speaking a great desire to
follow [???] flamed up in his heart - to follow [???] [???] and even perhaps to
find him again . it was so strong that it overcame his fear : he could almost
have run out there and then down the road without his hat [???] as [???] ha d done
on a similar morning long ago .
' my dear [???] ! ' exclaimed [???] . ' [???] really are amazing
creatures [???] as i have said before . you can learn all that there is to know
about their ways in a month [???] and yet after a hundred years they can still
surprise you at a pinch . i hardly expected to get such an answer [???] not even
from you . but [???] made no mistake in choosing his heir [???] though he little
thought how important it would prove . i am afraid you are right . the ring
will not be able to stay hidden in the shire much longer ; and for your own
sake [???] as well as for others [???] you will have to go [???] and leave the name of
[???] behind you . that name will not be safe to have [???] outside the shire or
in the wild . i will give you a travelling name now . when you go [???] go as mr .
[???] .
' but i don ' t think you need go alone . not if you know of anyone you can
trust [???] and who would be willing to go by your side - and that you would be
willing to take into unknown perils . but if you look for a companion [???] be
careful in choosing ! and be careful of what you say [???] even to your closest

friends ! the enemy has many spies and many ways of hearing . '
suddenly he stopped as if listening . [???] became aware that all was
very quiet [???] inside and outside . [???] crept to one side of the window .
then with a dart he sprang to the sill [???] and thrust a long arm out and
downwards . there was a [???] [???] and up came sam [???] ' s curly head
hauled by
one ear .
' well [???] well [???] bless my beard ! ' said [???] . ' sam [???] is it ? now what
may you be doing ? '
' lor bless you [???] mr . [???] [???] sir ! ' said sam . ' nothing ! leastways i was
just trimming the grass - border under the window [???] if you follow me . ' he
picked up his shears and exhibited them as evidence .
' i don ' t [???] ' said [???] grimly . it is some time since i last heard the
sound of your shears . how long have you been [???] ? '
' [???] [???] sir ? i don ' t follow you [???] begging your pardon . there
ain ' t no eaves at bag end [???] and that ' s a fact . '
' don ' t be a fool ! what have you heard [???] and why did you listen ? '
[???] ' s eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like [???] .
' mr . [???] [???] sir ! ' cried sam quaking . ' don ' t let him hurt me [???] sir ! don ' t
let him turn me into anything unnatural ! my old dad would take on so . i
meant no harm [???] on my honour [???] sir ! '
' he won ' t hurt you [???] ' said [???] [???] hardly able to keep from laughing [???]
although he was himself startled and rather puzzled . ' he knows [???] as well as i
do [???] that you mean no harm . but just you up and answer his questions straight
away ! '
' well [???] sir [???] ' said sam [???] a little . ' i heard a deal that i didn ' t
rightly understand [???] about an enemy [???] and rings [???] and mr . [???] [???] sir [???] and
dragons [???] and a fiery mountain [???] and - and elves [???] sir . i listened because i
couldn ' t help myself [???] if you know what i mean . lor bless me [???] sir [???] but i do
love tales of that sort . and i believe them too [???] whatever ted may say .
elves [???] sir ! i would dearly love to see them . cou [???] ' t you take me to see
elves [???] sir [???] when you go ? '
suddenly [???] laughed . ' come inside ! ' he shouted [???] and putting out
both his arms he lifted the astonished sam [???] shears [???] grass - [???] and all [???]
right through the window and stood him on the floor . ' take you to see elves [???]
eh ? ' he said [???] eyeing sam closely [???] but with a smile [???] on his face .
' so you heard that mr . [???] is going away ? '

' i did [???] sir . and that ' s why i choked : which you heard seemingly . i
tried not to [???] sir [???] but it burst out of me : i was so upset . '
' it can ' t be helped [???] sam [???] ' said [???] sadly . he had suddenly realized
that flying from the shire would mean more painful partings than merely
saying farewell to the familiar comforts of bag end . ' i shall have to go .
but ' - and here he looked hard at sam - ' if you really care about me [???] you
will keep that dead secret . see ? if you don ' t [???] if you even breathe a word of
what you ' ve heard here [???] then i hope [???] will turn you into a spotted
toad and fill the garden full of grass - snakes . '
sam fell on his knees [???] trembling . ' get up [???] sam ! ' said [???] . i have
thought of something better than that . something to shut your mouth [???] and
punish you properly for listening . you shall go away with mr . [???] ! '
' me [???] sir ! ' cried sam [???] springing up like a dog invited for a walk . ' me
go and see elves and all ! [???] ! ' he shouted [???] and then burst into tears .




chapter 3 . three is company



' you ought to go quietly [???] and you ought to go soon [???] ' said [???] . two
or three weeks had passed [???] and still [???] made no sign of getting ready to
go .
' i know . but it is difficult to do both [???] ' he objected . if i just vanish
like [???] [???] the tale will be all over the shire in no time . '
' of course you mustn ' t vanish ! ' said [???] . ' that wouldn ' t do at all !
i said soon [???] not instantly . if you can think of any way of slipping out of
the shire without its being generally known [???] it will be worth a little
delay . but you must not delay too long . '
' what about the autumn [???] on or after our birthday ? ' asked [???] . ' i
think i could probably make some arrangements by then . '
to tell the truth [???] he was very [???] to start [???] now that it had come
to the point . bag end seemed a more desirable residence than i t had for
years [???] and he wanted to savour as much as he could of his last summer in the
shire . when autumn came [???] he knew that part at least of his heart would think
more kindly of journeying [???] as it always did at that season . he had indeed
privately made up his mind to leave on his [???] birthday : [???] ' s one
hundred and twenty - eighth . it seemed somehow the proper day on which to set
out and follow him . following [???] was uppermost in his mind [???] and the one
thing that made the thought of leaving bearable . he thought as little as
possible about the ring [???] and where it might lead him in the end . but he did
not tell all his thoughts to [???] . what the [???] guessed was always
difficult to tell .
he looked at [???] and smiled . ' very well [???] ' he said . ' i think that will
do - but it must not be any later . i am getting very anxious . in the
mean - while [???] do take care [???] and don ' t let out any hint of where you are going !
and see that sam [???] does not talk . if he does [???] i really shall turn him
into a toad . '
' as for where i am going [???] ' said [???] [???] ' it would be difficult to give
that away [???] for i have no clear idea myself [???] yet . '
' don ' t be absurd ! ' said [???] . ' i am not warning you against leaving
an address at the post - office ! but you are leaving the shire - and that
should not be known [???] until you are far away . and you must go [???] or at least

set out [???] either north [???] south [???] west or east - and the direction should
certainly not be known . '
' i have been so taken up with the thoughts of leaving bag end [???] and of
saying farewell [???] that i have never even considered the direction [???] ' said
[???] . ' for where am i to go ? and by what shall i steer ? what is to be my
quest ? [???] went to find a treasure [???] there and back aga in ; but i go to lose
one [???] and not return [???] as far as i can see . '
' but you cannot see very far [???] ' said [???] . ' neither can i . it may be
your task to find the cracks of doom ; but that quest may be for others : i do
not know . at any rate you are not ready for that long road yet . '
' no indeed ! ' said [???] . ' but in the meantime what course am i to
lake ? '
' towards danger ; but not too rashly [???] nor too straight [???] ' answered the
[???] . ' if you want my advice [???] make for [???] . that journey should not
prove too perilous [???] though the road is less easy than it was [???] and it will
grow worse as the year fails . '
' [???] ! ' said [???] . ' very good : i will go east [???] and i will make
for [???] . i will take sam to visit the elves ; he will be delighted . ' he
spoke lightly ; but his heart was moved suddenly with a desire to see the
house of [???] [???] [???] and breathe the air of that deep valley where
many of the fair folk still dwelt in peace .
one summer ' s evening an astonishing piece of news reached the ivy bush
and green dragon . giants and other portents on the borders of the shire were
forgotten for more important matters : mr . [???] was selling bag end [???] indeed
he had already sold it - to the sackville - [???] !
' for a nice bit [???] loo [???] ' said some . ' at a bargain price [???] ' said others [???]
' and that ' s more likely when mistress [???] ' s the buyer . ' ( otho had died
some years before [???] at the ripe but disappointed age of 102 . )
just why mr . [???] was selling his beautiful hole was even more
[???] than the price . a few held the theory - supported by the nods and
hints of mr . [???] himself - that [???] ' s money was running out : he was
going to leave [???] and live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the sale
down in buckland among his [???] relations . ' as far from the
sackville - [???] as may be [???] ' some added . but so firmly fixed had the
notion of the [???] wealth of the [???] of bag end become that
most found this hard to believe [???] harder than any other reason or unreason
that their fancy could suggest : to most it suggested a dark and yet

[???] plot by [???] . though he kept himself very quiet and did not go
about by day [???] it was well known that he was ' hiding up in the bag end ' . but
however a removal might fit in with the designs of his [???] [???] there was
no doubt about the fact : [???] [???] was going back to buckland .
' yes [???] i shall be moving this autumn [???] ' he said . ' merry [???] is
looking out for a nice little hole for me [???] or perhaps a small house . '
as a matter of fact with merry ' s help he had already chosen and bought
a little house at [???] in the country beyond [???] . to all but
sam he pretended he was going to settle down there permanently . the decision
to set out eastwards had suggested the idea to him ; for buckland was on the
eastern borders of the shire [???] and as he had lived there in childhood his
going back would at least seem credible .
[???] stayed in the shire for over two months . then one evening [???] at
the end of june [???] soon after [???] ' s plan had been finally arranged [???] he
suddenly announced that he was going off again next morning . ' only for a
short while [???] i hope [???] ' he said . ' but i am going down beyond the southern
borders to get some news [???] if i can . i have been idle longer than i should . '
he spoke lightly [???] but it seemed to [???] that he looked rather worried .
' has anything happened ? ' he asked .
' well no ; but i have heard something that has made me anxious and needs
looking into . if i think it necessary after all for you to get off at once [???]
i shall come back immediately [???] or at least send word . in the meanwhile stick
to your plan ; but be more careful than ever [???] especially of the ring . let me
impress on you once more : don ' t use it ! '
he went off at dawn . ' i may be back any day [???] ' he said . ' at the very
latest i shall come back for the farewell party . i think after all you may
need my company on the road . '
at first [???] was a good deal disturbed [???] and wondered often what
[???] could have heard ; but his [???] wore off [???] and in the fine
weather he forgot his troubles for a while . the shire had seldom seen so
fair a summer [???] or so rich an autumn : the trees were laden with apples [???] honey
was dripping in the combs [???] and the corn was tall and full .
autumn was well under way before [???] began to worry about [???]
again . [???] was passing and there was still no news of him . the
birthday [???] and the removal [???] drew nearer [???] and still he did not come [???] or send
word . bag end began to be busy . some of [???] ' s friends came to stay and
help him with the packing : there was [???] bolger and [???] [???] [???] and

of course his special friends [???] took and merry [???] . between
them
they turned the whole place upside - down .
on [???] [???] two covered carts went off laden to buckland [???]
conveying the furniture and goods that [???] had not sold to his new home [???]
by way of the [???] bridge . the next day [???] became really anxious [???]
and kept a constant look - out for [???] . thursday [???] his birthday morning [???]
[???] as fair and clear as it had long ago for [???] ' s great party . still
[???] did not appear . in the evening [???] gave his farewell feast : it was
quite small [???] just a dinner for himself and his four helpers ; but he was
troubled and fell in no mood for it . the thought that he would so soon have
to part with his young friends weighed on his heart . he wondered how he
would break it to them .
the four younger [???] were [???] however [???] in high spirits [???] and the party
soon became very cheerful in spite of [???] ' s absence . the dining - room was
bare except for a table and chairs [???] but the food was good [???] and there was
good wine : [???] ' s wine had not been included in the sale to the
sackville - [???] .
' whatever happens to the rest of my stuff [???] when the s . - b . s get their
claws on it [???] at any rate i have found a good home for this ! ' said [???] [???] as
he drained his glass . it was the last drop of old [???] .
when they had sung many songs [???] and talked of many things they had done
together [???] they toasted [???] ' s birthday [???] and they drank his health and
[???] ' s together according to [???] ' s custom . then they went out for a sniff
of air [???] and glimpse of the stars [???] and then they went to bed . [???] ' s party
was over [???] and [???] had not come .
the next morning they were busy packing another cart with the remainder
of the [???] . merry took charge of this [???] and drove off with fatty ( that is
[???] bolger ) . ' someone must get there and warm the house before you
arrive [???] ' said merry . ' well [???] see you later - the day after tomorrow [???] if you
don ' t go to sleep on the way ! '
[???] went home aft er lunch [???] but [???] remained behind . [???] was
restless and anxious [???] listening in vain for a sound of [???] . he decided
to wait until nightfall . after that [???] if [???] wanted him urgently [???] he
would go to [???] [???] and might even get there first . for [???] was going
on foot . his plan - for pleasure and a last look at the shire as much as any
other reason - was to walk from [???] to [???] ferry [???] taking it

fairly easy .
' i shall get myself a bit into training [???] too [???] ' he said [???] looking at
himself in a dusty mirror in the half - empty hall . he had not done any
[???] walking for a long time [???] and the reflection looked rather [???] [???]
he thought .
after lunch [???] the sackville - [???] [???] [???] and her sandy - haired son [???]
[???] [???] turned up [???] much to [???] ' s annoyance . ' ours at last ! ' said [???] [???]
as she stepped inside . it was not polite ; nor strictly true [???] for the sale of
bag end did not take effect until midnight . but [???] can perhaps be
forgiven : she had been obliged to wait about seventy - seven years longer for
bag end than she once hoped [???] and she was now a hundred years old .
anyway [???]
she had come to see that nothing she had paid for had been carried off ; and
she wanted the keys . it took a long while to satisfy her [???] as she had brought
a complete inventory with her and went right through it . in the end she
departed with [???] and the spare key and the promise that the other key
would be left at the [???] ' in [???] row . she snorted [???] and showed
plainly that she thought the [???] capable of [???] the hole during
the night . [???] did not offer her any tea .
he took his own tea with [???] and sam [???] in the kitchen . it had
been officially announced that sam was coming to buckland ' to do for mr .
[???] and look after his bit of garden ' ; an arrangement that was approved by
the [???] [???] though it did not console him for the prospect of having [???]
as a neighbour .
' our last meal at bag end ! ' said [???] [???] pushing back his chair . they
left the washing up for [???] . [???] and sam strapped up their three
packs and piled them in the porch . [???] went out for a last stroll in the
garden . sam disappeared .
the sun went down . bag end seemed sad and gloomy and [???] .
[???]
wandered round the familiar rooms [???] and saw the light of the sunset fade on
the walls [???] and shadows creep out of the corners . it grew slowly dark
[???] . he went out and walked down to the gate at the bottom of the path [???]
and then on a short way down the hill road . he half expected to see [???]
come striding up through the [???] .
the sky was clear and the stars were growing bright . ' it ' s going to be
a fine night [???] ' he said aloud . ' that ' s good for a beginning . i feel like

walking . i can ' t bear any more hanging about . i am going to start [???] and
[???] must follow me . ' he turned to go back [???] and then [???] [???] for he
heard voices [???] just round the corner by the end of [???] row . one voice was
certainly the old [???] ' s ; the other was strange [???] and somehow [???] .
he could not make out what it said [???] but he heard the [???] ' s answers [???] which
were rather shrill . the old man seemed put out .
' no [???] mr . [???] has gone away . went this morning [???] and my sam went
with
him : anyway all his stuff went . yes [???] sold out and gone [???] i tell ' ee . why ?
why ' s none of my business [???] or yours . where to ? that ain ' t no secret . he ' s
moved to [???] or some such place [???] away down yonder . yes it is - a tidy
way . i ' ve never been so far myself ; they ' re queer folks in buckland . no [???] i
can ' t give no message . good night to you ! '
[???] went away down the hill . [???] wondered vaguely why the fact
that they did not come on up the hill seemed a great relief . ' i am sick of
questions a nd curiosity about my doings [???] i suppose [???] ' he thought . ' what an
[???] lot they all are ! ' he had half a mind to go and ask the [???]
who the inquirer was ; but he thought better ( or worse ) of it [???] and turned and
walked quickly back to bag end .
[???] was sitting on his pack in the porch . sam was not there . [???]
stepped inside the dark door . ' sam ! ' he called . ' sam ! time ! '
' coming [???] sir ! ' came the answer from far within [???] followed soon by sam
himself [???] wiping his mouth . he had been saying farewell to the beer - barrel in
the cellar .
' all aboard [???] sam ? ' said [???] .
' yes [???] sir . i ' ll last for a bit now [???] sir . '
[???] shut and locked the round door [???] and gave the key to sam . ' run
down with this to your home [???] sam ! ' he said . ' then cu t along the row and meet
us as quick as you can at the gate in the lane beyond the [???] . we are
not going through the village tonight . too many ears pricking and eyes
prying . ' sam ran off at full speed .
' well [???] now we ' re off at last ! ' said [???] . they shouldered their packs
and took up their sticks [???] and walked round the corner to the west side of
bag end . ' good - bye ! ' said [???] [???] looking at the dark blank windows . he
waved
his hand [???] and then turned and ( following [???] [???] if he had known it ) hurried
after [???] down the garden - path . they jumped over the low place in the

hedge at the bottom and took to the fields [???] passing into the darkness like a
rustle in the grasses .
at the bottom of the hill on its western side they came to the gate
opening on to a narrow lane . there they halted and [???] the straps of
their packs . presently sam appeared [???] trotting quickly and breathing hard ;
his heavy pack was hoisted high on his shoulders [???] and he had put on his head
a tall shapeless fell bag [???] which he called a hat . in the gloom he looked
very much like a dwarf .
' i am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff [???] ' said [???] . ' i
pity snails [???] and all that carry their homes on their backs . '
' i could take a lot more yet [???] sir . my packet is quite light [???] ' said sam
stoutly and [???] .
' no [???] you don ' t [???] sam ! ' said [???] . ' it is good for him . he ' s got
nothing except what he ordered us to pack . he ' s been slack lately [???] and he ' ll
feel the weight less when he ' s walked off some of his own . '
' be kind to a poor old hobbit ! ' laughed [???] . ' i shall be as thin as a
willow - wand [???] i ' m sure [???] before i get to buckland . but i was talking nonsense .
i suspect you have taken more than your share [???] sam [???] and i shall look into it
at our next packing . ' he picked up his stick again . ' well [???] we all like
walking in the dark [???] ' he said [???] ' so let ' s put some miles behind us before
bed . '
for a short way they followed the lane westwards . then leaving it they
turned left and took quietly to the fields again . they went in single file
along hedgerows and the borders of [???] [???] and night fell dark about them .
in their dark cloaks they were as invisible as if they all had magic rings .
since they were all [???] [???] and were trying to be silent [???] they made no
noise that even [???] would hear . even the wild things in the fields and
woods hardly noticed their passing .
after some time they crossed the water [???] west of [???] [???] by a narrow
plank - bridge . the stream was there no more than a winding black ribbon [???]
bordered with leaning alder - trees . a mile or two further south they hastily
crossed the great road from the [???] bridge ; they were now in the
tookland and bending south - eastwards they made for the green hill country .
as they began to climb its first [???] they looked back and saw the lamps
in [???] far off [???] in the gentle valley of the water . soon it
disappeared in the folds of the darkened land [???] and was followed by bywater
beside its grey pool . when the light of the last farm was far behind [???]

peeping among the trees [???] [???] turned and waved a hand in farewell .
' i wonder if i shall ever look down into that valley again [???] ' he said
quietly .
when they had walked for about three hours they rested . the night was
clear [???] cool [???] and starry [???] but smoke - like wisps of mist were creeping up the
hill - sides from the streams and deep [???] . thin - clad birches [???] swaying in
a light wind above their heads [???] made a black net aga inst the pale sky . they
ate a very [???] supper ( for [???] ) [???] and then went on again . soon they
struck a narrow road [???] that went rolling up and down [???] fading grey into the
darkness ahead : the road to [???] [???] and stock [???] and the [???] ferry .
it climbed away from the main road in the water - valley [???] and wound over the
skirts of the green hills towards woody - end [???] a wild corner of the
[???] .
after a while they [???] into a deeply cloven track between tall
trees that rustled their dry leaves in the night . it was very dark . at first
they talked [???] or hummed a tune softly together [???] being now far away from
[???] ears . then they marched on in silence [???] and [???] began to lag
behind . at last [???] as they began to climb a steep slope [???] he stopped and
yawned .
' i am so sleepy [???] ' he said [???] ' that soon i shall fall down on the road .
are you going to sleep on your legs ? it is nearly midnight . '
' i thought you liked walking in the dark [???] ' said [???] . ' but there is no
great hurry . merry expects us some time the day after tomorrow ; but that
leaves us nearly two days more . we ' ll halt at the first likely spot . '
' the wind ' s in the west [???] ' said sam . ' if we get to the other side of
this hill [???] we shall find a spot that is sheltered and snug enough [???] sir .
there is a dry fir - wood just ahead [???] if i remember rightly . ' sam knew the
land well within twenty miles of [???] [???] but that was the limit of his
[???] .
just over the top of the hill they came on the patch of fir - wood .
leaving the road they went into the deep resin - scented darkness of the
trees [???] and gathered dead sticks and cones to make a fire . soon they had a
merry crackle of flame at the foot of a large fir - tree and they sat round it
for a while [???] until they began to nod . then [???] each in an angle of the great
tree ' s roots [???] they curled up in their cloaks and blankets [???] and were soon
fast asleep . they set no watch ; even [???] feared no danger yet [???] for they
were still in the heart of the shire . a few creatures came and looked at

them when the fire had died away . a fox passing through the wood on business
of his own stopped several minutes and [???] .
' [???] ! ' he thought . ' well [???] what next ? i have heard of strange doings
in this land [???] but i have seldom heard of a hobbit sleeping out of doors
under a tree . three of them ! there ' s something mighty queer behind this . ' he
was quite right [???] but he never found out any more about it .
the morning came [???] pale and [???] . [???] woke up first [???] and found that
a tree - root had made a hole in his back [???] and that his neck was stiff .
' walking for pleasure ! why didn ' t i drive ? ' he thought [???] as he usually
did at the beginning of an expedition . ' and all my beautiful feather beds
are sold to the sackville - [???] ! these tree - roots would do them good . '
he stretched . ' wake up [???] [???] ! ' he cried . it ' s a beautiful morning . '
' what ' s beautiful about it ? ' said [???] [???] peering over the edge of his
blanket with one eye . ' sam ! gel breakfast ready for half - past nine ! have you
got the bath - water hot ? '
sam jumped up [???] looking rather bleary . ' no [???] sir [???] i haven ' t [???] sir ! ' he
said .
[???] stripped the blankets from [???] and rolled him over [???] and then
walked off to the edge of the wood . away eastward the sun was rising red out
of the mists that lay thick on the world . touched with gold and red the
autumn trees seemed to be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea . a little below
him to the left the road ran down steeply into a hollow and disappeared .
when he returned sam and [???] had got a good fire going . ' water ! '
shouted [???] . ' where ' s the water ? '
' i don ' t keep water in my pockets [???] ' said [???] . ' we thought you had
gone to find some [???] ' said [???] [???] busy setting out the food [???] and cups . ' you
had better go now . '
' you can come too [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and bring all the water - bottles . '
there was a stream at the foot of the hill . they filled their bottles and
the small camping [???] at a little fall where the water fell a few feet
over an [???] of grey stone . it was icy cold ; and they [???] and
puffed as they bathed their faces and hands .
when their breakfast was over [???] and their packs all [???] up again [???] it
was after ten o ' clock [???] and the day was beginning to turn fine and hot . they
went down the slope [???] and across the stream where it dived under the road [???]
and up the next slope [???] and up and down another shoulder of the hills ; and by
that time their cloaks [???] blankets [???] water [???] food [???] and other gear already seemed

a heavy burden .
the day ' s march promised to be warm and tiring work . after some miles [???]
however [???] the road ceased to roll up and down : it climbed to the top of a
steep bank in a weary zig - [???] sort of way [???] and then prepared to go down
for the last time . in front of them they saw the lower lands dotted with
small clumps of trees that melted away in the distance to a brown woodland
haze . they were looking across the woody end towards the [???]
river .
the road wound away before them like a piece of string .
' the road goes on for ever [???] ' said [???] ; ' but i can ' t without a rest .
it is high time for lunch . ' he sat down on the bank at the side of the road
and looked away east into the haze [???] beyond which lay the river [???] and the end
of the shire in which he had spent all his life . sam stood by him . his round
eyes were wide open - for he was looking across lands he had never seen to a
new [???] .
' do elves live in those woods ? ' he asked .
' not that i ever heard [???] ' said [???] . [???] was silent . he too was
gazing eastward along the road [???] as if he had never seen it before . suddenly
he spoke [???] aloud but as if to himself [???] saying slowly :
the road goes ever on and on
down from the door where it began .
now far ahead the road has gone [???]
and i must follow [???] if i can [???]
pursuing it with weary feet [???]
until it joins some larger way [???]
where many paths and errands meet .
and whither then ? i cannot say .
' that sounds like a bit of old [???] ' s rhyming [???] ' said [???] . ' or is it
one of your imitations ? it does not sound altogether encouraging . '
' i don ' t know [???] ' said [???] . it came to me then [???] as if i was making it
up ; but i may have heard it long ago . certainly it reminds me very much of
[???] in the last years [???] before he went away . he used often to say there was
only one road ; that it was like a great river : its springs were at every
doorstep [???] and every path was its [???] . [???] it ' s a dangerous business [???]
[???] [???] going out of your door [???] [???] he used to say . [???] you step into the road [???] and
if you don ' t keep your feet [???] there is no knowing where you might be swept
off to . do you realize that this is the very path that goes through

[???] [???] and that if you let it [???] it might take you to the lonely mountain
or even further and to worse places ? [???] he used to say that on the path
outside the front door at bag end [???] especially after he had been out for a
long walk . '
' well [???] the road won ' t sweep me a [???] for an hour at least [???] ' said
[???] [???] [???] his pack . the others followed his example [???] putting their
packs against the bank and their legs out into the road . after a rest they
had a good lunch [???] and then more rest .
the sun was beginning to get low and the light of afternoon was on the
land as they went down the hill . so far they had not met a soul on the road .
this way was not much used [???] being hardly fit for carts [???] and there was little
traffic to the woody end . they had been jogging along again for an hour or
more when sam stopped a moment as if listening . they were now on level
ground [???] and the road after much winding lay straight ahead through
grass - land [???] with tall trees [???] outliers of the approaching woods .
' i can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind [???] ' said sam .
they looked back [???] but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing
far . ' i wonder if that is [???] coming after us [???] ' said [???] ; but even as
he said it [???] he had a feeling that it was not so [???] and a sudden desire to hide
from the view of the rider came over him .
' it may not matter much [???] ' he said apologetically [???] ' but i would rather
not be seen on the road - by anyone . i am sick of my doings being noticed
and discussed . and if it is [???] [???] ' he added as an [???] [???] ' we can
give him a little surprise [???] to pay him out for being so late . let ' s get out
of sight ! '
the other two ran quickly to the left and down into a little hollow not
far from the road . there they lay flat . [???] [???] for a second :
curiosity or some other feeling was struggling with his desire to hide . the
sound of [???] drew nearer . just in time he threw himself down in a patch of
long grass behind a tree that [???] the road . then he lifted his head
and peered [???] above one of the great roots .
round the corner came a black horse [???] no hobbit - pony but a full - sized
horse ; and on it sat a large man [???] who seemed to crouch in the saddle [???]
wrapped in a great black cloak and hood [???] so that only his boots in the high
[???] showed below ; his face was shadowed and invisible .
when it reached the tree and was level with [???] the horse stopped .
the riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed [???] as if listening . from

inside the hood came a noise as of someone [???] to catch an [???]
scent ; the head turned from side to side of the road .
a sudden [???] fear of discovery laid hold of [???] [???] and he
thought of his ring . he hardly dared to breathe [???] and yet the desire to get
it out of his pocket became so strong that he began slowly to move his hand .
he felt that he had only to slip it on [???] and then he would be safe . the
advice of [???] seemed absurd . [???] had used the ring . ' and i am still in
the shire [???] ' he thought [???] as his hand touched the chain on which it hung . at
that moment the rider sat up [???] and shook the reins . the horse stepped
forward [???] walking slowly at first [???] and then breaking into a quick trot .
[???] [???] to the edge of the road and watched the rider [???] until he
[???] into the distance . he could not be quite sure [???] but it seemed to him
that suddenly [???] before it passed out of sight [???] the horse turned aside and
went into the trees on the right .
' well [???] i call that very queer [???] and indeed disturbing [???] ' said [???] to
himself [???] as he walked towards his companions . [???] and sam had remained
flat in the grass [???] and had seen nothing ; so [???] described the rider and
his strange behaviour .
' i can ' t say why [???] but i felt certain he was looking or smelling for me ;
and also i felt certain that i did not want him to discover me . i ' ve never
seen or fell anything like it in the shire before . '
' but what has one of the big people got to do with us ? ' said [???] .
' and what is he doing in this part of the world ? '
' there are some men about [???] ' said [???] . ' down in the [???] they
have had trouble with big people [???] i believe . but i have never heard of
anything like this rider . i wonder where he comes from . '
' begging your pardon [???] ' put in sam suddenly [???] ' i know where he comes
from . it ' s from [???] that this here black rider comes [???] unless there ' s
more than one . and i know where he ' s going to . '
' what do you mean ? ' said [???] sharply [???] looking at him in astonishment .
' why didn ' t you speak up before ? '
' i have only just remembered [???] sir . it was like this : when i got back to
our hole yesterday evening with the key [???] my dad [???] he says to me : hello [???] sam !
he says . i thought you were away with mr . [???] this morning . there ' s been a
strange customer asking for mr . [???] of bag end [???] and he ' s only just gone .
i ' ve sent him on to [???] . not that i liked the sound of him . he seemed
mighty put out [???] when i told him mr . [???] had left his old home for good .

[???] at me [???] he did . it gave me quite a shudder . what sort of a fellow was
he ? says i to the [???] . [???] don ' t know [???] says he ; but he wasn ' t a hobbit . he
was tall and black - like [???] and he stooped aver me . i reckon it was one of the
big folk from foreign parts . he spoke funny .
' i couldn ' t stay to hear more [???] sir [???] since you were waiting ; and i
didn ' t give much heed to it myself . the [???] is getting old [???] and more than
a bit blind [???] and it must have been near dark when this fellow come up the
hill and found him taking the air at the end of our row . i hope he hasn ' t
done no harm [???] sir [???] nor me . '
' the [???] can ' t be blamed anyway [???] ' said [???] . ' as a matter of fact i
heard him talking to a stranger [???] who seemed to be inquiring for me [???] and i
nearly went and asked him who it was . i wish i had [???] or you had told me about
it before . i might have been more careful on the road . '
' still [???] there may be no [???] between this rider and the [???] ' s
stranger [???] ' said [???] . ' we left [???] secretly enough [???] and i don ' t see
how he could have followed us . '
' what about the smelling [???] sir ? ' said sam . ' and the [???] said he was a
black chap . '
' i wish i had waited for [???] [???] ' [???] muttered . ' but perhaps it
would only have made matters worse . '
' then you know or guess something about this rider ? ' said [???] [???] who
had caught the muttered words .
' i don ' t know [???] and i would rather not guess [???] ' said [???] . ' all right [???]
cousin [???] ! you can keep your secret for the present [???] if you want to be
mysterious . in the meanwhile what are we to do ? i should like a bite and a
sup [???] but somehow i think we had better move on from here . your talk of
[???] riders with invisible noses has unsettled me . '
' yes [???] i think we will move on now [???] ' said [???] ; ' but not on the road
- in case that rider comes back [???] or another follows him . we ought to do a
good step more today . buckland is still miles away . '
the shadows of the trees were long and thin on the grass [???] as they
started off again . they now kept a stone ' s throw to the left of the road [???]
and kept out of sight of it as much as they could . but this hindered them ;
for the grass was thick and [???] [???] and the ground uneven [???] and the trees
began to draw together into thickets .
the sun had gone down red behind the hills at their backs [???] and evening
was coming on before they came back to the road at the end of the long level

over which it had run straight for some miles . at that point it bent left
and went down into the [???] of the yale making for stock ; but a lane
branched right [???] winding through a wood of ancient oak - trees on its way to
[???] . ' that is the way for us [???] ' said [???] .
not far from the road - meeting they came on the huge hulk of a tree : it
was still alive and had leaves on the small branches that it had put out
round the broken stumps of its long - fallen limbs ; but it was hollow [???] and
could be entered by a great crack on the side away from the road . the
[???] crept inside [???] and sat there upon a floor of old leaves and decayed
wood . they rested and had a light meal [???] talking quietly and listening from
time to time .
[???] was about them as they crept back to the lane . the west wind
was sighing in the branches . leaves were whispering . soon the road began to
fall gently but steadily into the [???] . a star came out above the trees in
the darkening east before them . they went [???] and in step [???] to keep up
their spirits . after a time [???] as the stars grew thicker and brighter [???] the
feeling of [???] left them [???] and they no longer listened for the sound of
[???] . they began to hum softly [???] as [???] have a way of doing as they walk
along [???] especially when they are drawing near to home at night . with most
[???] it is a supper - song or a bed - song ; but these [???] hummed a
walking - song ( though not [???] of course [???] without any mention of supper and bed ) .
[???] [???] had made the words [???] to a tune that was as old as the hills [???]
and taught it to [???] as they walked in the lanes of the water - valley and
talked about adventure .
upon the hearth the fire is red [???]
beneath the roof there is a bed ;
but not yet weary are our feet [???]
still round the corner we may meet
a sudden tree or standing stone
that none have seen but we alone .
tree and flower and leaf and grass [???]
let them pass ! let them pass !
hill and water under sky [???]
pass them by ! pass them by !

still round the corner there may wait
a new road or a secret gate [???]

and though we pass them by today [???]
tomorrow we may come this way
and take the hidden paths that run
towards the moon or to the sun .
apple [???] thorn [???] and nut and sloe [???]
let them go ! let them go !
sand and stone and pool and dell [???]
fare you well ! fare you well !

home is behind [???] the world ahead [???]
and there are many paths to tread
through shadows to the edge of night [???]
until the stars are all alight .
then world behind and home ahead [???]
we ' ll wander back to home and bed .
mist and [???] [???] cloud and shade [???]
away shall fade ! away shall fade !
fire and lamp [???] and meat and bread [???]
and then to bed ! and then to bed !
the song ended . ' and now to bed ! and now to bed ! ' sang [???] in a high
voice .
' hush ! ' said [???] . ' i think i hear [???] again . '
they [???] suddenly and stood as silent as tree - shadows [???] listening .
there was a sound of [???] in the lane [???] some way behind [???] but coming slow and
clear down the wind . quickly and quietly they slipped off the path [???] and ran
into the deeper shade under the oak - trees .
' don ' t let us go too far ! ' said [???] . ' i don ' t want to be seen [???] but i
want to see if it is another black rider . '
' very well ! ' said [???] . ' but don ' t forget the [???] ! '
the [???] drew nearer . they had no time to find any hiding - place better
than the general darkness under the trees ; sam and [???] [???] behind a
large tree - bole [???] while [???] crept back a few yards towards the lane . it
showed grey and pale [???] a line of fading light through the wood . above it the
stars were thick in the dim sky [???] but there was no moon .
the sound of [???] stopped . as [???] watched he saw something dark pass
across the lighter space between two trees [???] and then halt . it looked like
the black shade of a horse led by a smaller black shadow . the black shadow

stood close to the point where they had left the path [???] and it swayed from
side to side . [???] thought he heard the sound of snuffling . the shadow bent
to the ground [???] and then began to [???] towards him .
once more the desire to slip on the ring came over [???] ; but this time
it was stronger than before . so strong that [???] almost before he realized what
he was doing [???] his hand was groping in his pocket . but at that moment there
came a sound like mingled song and laughter . clear voices rose and fell in
the [???] air . the black shadow straightened up and retreated . it climbed
on to the shadowy horse and seemed to vanish across the lane into the
darkness on the other side . [???] breathed again .
' elves ! ' exclaimed sam in a hoarse whisper . ' elves [???] sir ! ' he would have
burst out of the trees and dashed off towards the voices [???] if they had not
pulled him back .
' yes [???] it is elves [???] ' said [???] . ' one can meet them sometimes in the
woody end . they don ' t live in the shire [???] but they wander into it in spring
and autumn [???] out of their own lands away beyond the tower hills . i am
thankful that they do ! you did not see [???] but that black rider stopped just
here and was actually [???] towards us when the song began . as soon as he
heard the voices he slipped away . '
' what about the elves ? ' said sam [???] too excited to trouble about the
rider . ' can ' t we go and see them ? '
' listen ! they are coming this way [???] ' said [???] . ' we have only to wait . '
the singing drew nearer . one clear voice rose now above the others . it was
singing in the fair elven - tongue [???] of which [???] knew only a little [???] and the
others knew nothing . yet the sound [???] with the melody seemed to shape
itself in their thought into words which they only partly understood . this
was the song as [???] heard it :
snow - white ! snow - white ! o lady clear !
o queen beyond the western seas !
o light to us that wander here
amid the world of woven trees !

[???] ! o [???] !
clear are thy eyes and bright thy breath !
snow - white ! snow - white ! we sing to thee
in a far land beyond the sea .


o stars that in the sunless year
with shining hand by her were sawn [???]
in windy fields now bright and clear
we see your silver blossom blown !

o [???] ! [???] !
we still remember [???] we who dwell
in this far land beneath the trees [???]
thy starlight on the western seas .
the song ended . ' these are high elves ! they spoke the name of
[???] ! ' said [???] in amazement [???] ' few of that fairest folk are ever seen
in the shire . not many now remain in middle - earth [???] east of the great sea .
this is indeed a strange chance ! '
the [???] sat in shadow by the wayside . before long the elves came
down the lane towards the valley . they passed slowly [???] and the [???] could
see the starlight [???] on their hair and in their eyes . they bore no
lights [???] yet as they walked a [???] [???] like the light of the moon above the
rim of the hills before it rises [???] seemed to fall about their feet . they were
now silent [???] and as the last elf passed he turned and looked towards the
[???] and laughed .
' hail [???] [???] ! ' he cried . ' you are abroad late . or are you perhaps
lost ? ' then he called aloud to the others [???] and all the company stopped and
gathered round .
' this is indeed wonderful ! ' they said . ' three [???] in a wood at
night ! we have not seen such a thing since [???] went away . what is the
meaning of it ? '
' the meaning of it [???] fair people [???] ' said [???] [???] ' is simply that we seem
to be going the same way as you are . i like walking under the stars . but i
would welcome your company . '
' but we have no need of other company [???] and [???] are so dull [???] ' they
laughed . ' and how do you know that we go the same way as you [???] for you do
not
know whither we are going ? '
' and how do you know my name ? ' asked [???] in return .
' we know many things [???] ' they said . ' we have seen you often before with
[???] [???] though you may not have seen us . '
' who are you [???] and who is your lord ? ' asked [???] .

' i am gildor [???] ' answered their leader [???] the elf who had first hailed him .
' gildor [???] of the house of finrod . we are exiles [???] and most of our
kindred have long ago departed and we too are now only tarrying here a
while [???] ere we return over the great sea . but some of our kinsfolk dwell
still in peace in [???] . come now [???] [???] [???] tell us what you are doing ?
for we see that there is some shadow of fear upon you . '
' o wise people ! ' interrupted [???] eagerly . ' tell us about the black
riders ! '
' black riders ? ' they said in low voices . ' why do you ask a bout black
riders ? '
' because two black riders have overtaken us today [???] or one has done so
twice [???] ' said [???] ; ' only a little while ago he slipped away as you drew
near . '
the elves did not answer at once [???] but spoke together softly in their
own tongue . at length gildor turned to the [???] . ' we will not speak of
this here [???] ' he said . ' we think you had best come now with us . it is not our
custom [???] but for this time we will lake you on our road [???] and you shall lodge
with us tonight [???] if you will . '
' o fair folk ! this is good fortune beyond my hope [???] ' said [???] . sam
was speechless . ' i thank you indeed [???] gildor [???] [???] ' said [???] bowing .
' elen [???] l [???] menn ' [???] [???] a star shines on the hour of our meeting [???] ' he
added in the high - elven speech .
' be careful [???] friends ! ' cried gildor laughing . ' speak no secrets ! here
is a scholar in the ancient tongue . [???] was a good master . hail [???]
elf - friend ! ' he said [???] bowing to [???] . ' come now with your friends and join
our company ! you had best walk in the middle so that you may not stray . you
may be weary before we halt . '
' why ? where are you going ? ' asked [???] .
' for tonight we go to the woods on the hills above [???] . it is some
miles [???] but you shall have rest at the end of it [???] and it will shorten your
journey tomorrow . '
they now marched on again in silence [???] and passed like shadows and faint
lights : for elves ( even more than [???] ) could walk when they wished
without sound or footfall . [???] soon began to feel sleepy [???] and [???]
once or twice ; but each time a tall elf at his side put out his arm and
saved him from a fall . sam walked along at [???] ' s side [???] as if in a dream [???]
with an expression on his face half of fear and half of astonished joy .

the woods on either side became denser ; the trees were now younger and
thicker ; and as the lane went lower [???] running down into a fold of the hills [???]
there were many deep brakes of hazel on the rising [???] at either hand . at
last the elves turned aside from the path . a green ride lay almost unseen
through the thickets on the right ; and this they followed as it wound away
back up the wooded [???] on to the top of a shoulder of the hills that
stood out into the lower land of the river - valley . suddenly they came out of
the shadow of the trees [???] and before them lay a wide space of grass [???] grey
under the night . on three sides the woods pressed upon it ; but eastward the
ground fell steeply and the tops of the dark trees [???] growing at the bottom of
the slope [???] were below their feet . beyond [???] the low lands lay dim and flat
under the stars . nearer at hand a few lights [???] in the village of
[???] .
the elves sat on the grass and spoke together in soft voices ; they
seemed to take no further notice of the [???] . [???] and his companions
wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets [???] and drowsiness stole over them .
the night grew on [???] and the lights in the valley went out . [???] fell
asleep [???] pillowed on a green hillock .
away high in the east swung [???] [???] the netted stars [???] and slowly
above the mists red [???] rose [???] glowing like a jewel of fire . then by some
shift of airs all the mist was drawn away like a veil [???] and there leaned up [???]
as he climbed over the rim of the world [???] the swordsman of the sky [???]
[???] with his shining belt . the elves all burst into song . suddenly
under the trees a fire sprang up with a red light .
' come ! ' the elves called to the [???] . ' come ! now is the time for
speech and merriment ! '
[???] sat up and rubbed his eyes . he shivered . ' there is a fire in the
hall [???] and food for hungry guests [???] ' said an elf standing before him .
at the south end of the [???] there was an opening . there the
green floor ran on into the wood [???] and formed a wide space like a hall [???]
roofed by the boughs of trees . their great trunks ran like pillars down each
side . in the middle there was a wood - fire blazing [???] and upon the tree - pillars
torches with lights of gold and silver were burning steadily . the elves sat
round the fire upon the grass or upon the sawn rings of old trunks . some
went to and fro bearing cups and pouring drink ; others brought food on
heaped plates and dishes .
' this is poor fare [???] ' they said to the [???] ; ' for we are lodging in

the [???] far from our halls . if ever you are our guests at home [???] we
will treat you better . '
' it seems to me good enough for a birthday - party [???] ' said [???] .
[???] afterwards recalled little o f either food or drink [???] for his mind
was filled with the light upon the elf - faces [???] and the sound of voices so
various and so beautiful that he felt in a waking dream . but he remembered
that there was bread [???] [???] the savour of a fair white loaf to one who
is starving ; and fruits sweet as [???] and richer than the tended
fruits of gardens ; he drained a cup that was filled with a fragrant draught [???]
cool as a clear fountain [???] golden as a summer afternoon .
sam could never describe in words [???] nor picture clearly to himself [???] what
he felt or thought that night [???] though it remained in his memory as one of
the chief events of his life . the nearest he ever got was to say : ' well [???]
sir [???] if i could grow apples like that [???] i would call myself a gardener . but
it was the singing that went to my heart [???] if you know what i mean . '
[???] sat [???] eating [???] drinking [???] and talking with delight ; but his mind was
chiefly on the words spoken . he knew a little of the elf - speech and listened
eagerly . now and again he spoke to those that served him and thanked them in
their own language . they smiled at him and said laughing : ' here is a jewel
among [???] ! '
after a while [???] fell fast asleep [???] and was lifted up and borne away
to a bower under the trees ; there he was laid upon a soft bed and slept the
rest of the night away . sam refused to leave his master . when [???] had
gone [???] he came and sat curled up at [???] ' s feet [???] where at last he nodded and
closed his eyes . [???] remained long awake [???] talking with gildor .
they spoke of many things [???] old and new [???] and [???] questioned gildor
much about happenings in the wide world outside the shire . the tidings were
mostly sad and [???] : of gathering darkness [???] the wars of men [???] and the
flight of the elves . at last [???] asked the question that was nearest to
his heart :
' tell me [???] gildor [???] have you ever seen [???] since he left us ? '
gildor smiled . ' yes [???] ' he answered . ' twice . he said farewell to us on
this very spot . but i saw him once again [???] far from here . ' he would say no
more about [???] [???] and [???] fell silent .
' you do not ask me or tell me much that concerns yourself [???] [???] [???] ' said
gildor . ' but i already know a little [???] and i can read more in your face and
in the thought behind your questions . you are leaving the shire [???] and yet you

doubt that you will find what you seek [???] or accomplish what you intend [???] or
that you will ever return . is not that so ? '
' it is [???] ' said [???] ; ' but i thought my going was a secret known only to
[???] and my faithful sam . ' he looked down at sam [???] who was [???]
gently .
' the secret will not reach the enemy from us [???] ' said gildor .
' the enemy ? ' said [???] . ' then you know why i am leaving the shire ? '
' i do not know for what reason the enemy is pursuing you [???] ' answered
gildor ; ' but i perceive that he is - strange indeed though that seems to me .
and i warn you that peril is now both before you and behind you [???] and upon
either side . '
' you mean the riders ? i feared that they were servants of the enemy .
what are the black riders ? '
' has [???] told you nothing ? '
' nothing about such creatures . '
' then i think it is not for me to say more - lest terror should keep
you from your journey . for it seems to me that you have set out only just in
time [???] if indeed you are in time . you must now make haste [???] and neither stay
nor turn back ; for the shire is no longer any protection to you . '
' i cannot imagine what information could be more terrifying than your
hints and warnings [???] ' exclaimed [???] . ' i knew that danger lay ahead [???] of
course ; but i did not expect to meet it in our own shire . can ' t a hobbit
walk from the water to the river in peace ? '
' but it is not your own shire [???] ' said gildor . ' others dwelt here before
[???] were ; and others will dwell here again when [???] are no more . the
wide world is all about you : you can fence yourselves in [???] but you cannot for
ever fence it out . '
' i know - and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar . what can i
do now ? my plan was to leave the shire secretly [???] and make my way to
[???] ; but now my [???] are dogged [???] before ever i get to buckland . '
' i think you should still follow that plan [???] ' said gildor . ' i do not
think the road will prove too hard for your courage . but if you desire
clearer counsel [???] you should ask [???] . i do not know the reason for your
flight [???] and therefore i do not know by what means your pursuers will assail
you . these things [???] must know . i suppose that you will see him before
you leave the shire ? '
' i hope so . but that is another thing that makes me anxious . i have

been expecting [???] for many days . he was to have come to [???] at
the
latest two nights ago ; but he has never appeared . now i am wondering what
can have happened . should i wait for him ? '
gildor was silent for a moment . ' i do not like this news [???] ' he said at
last . ' that [???] should be late [???] does not bode well . but it is said : do
not meddle in the affairs o f [???] [???] for they are subtle and quick to
anger . the choice is yours : to go or wait . '
' and it is also said [???] ' answered [???] : ' go not to the elves for
counsel [???] for they will say both no and yes . '
' is it indeed ? ' laughed gildor . ' elves seldom give [???] advice [???]
for advice is a dangerous gift [???] even from the wise to the wise [???] and all
courses may run ill . but what would you ? you have not told me all concerning
yourself ; and how then shall i choose better than you ? but if you demand
advice [???] i will for friendship ' s sake give it . i think you should now go at
once [???] without delay ; and if [???] does not come before you set out [???] then i
also advise this : do not go alone . take such friends as are trusty and
willing . now you should be grateful [???] for i do not give this counsel gladly .
the elves have their own labours and their own sorrows [???] and they are little
concerned with the ways of [???] [???] or of any other creatures upon earth .
our paths cross theirs seldom [???] by chance or purpose . in this meeting there
may be more than chance ; but the purpose is not clear to me [???] and i fear to
say too much . '
' i am deeply grateful [???] ' said [???] ; ' but i wish you would tell me
plainly what the black riders are . if i take your advice i may not see
[???] for a long while [???] and i ought to know what is the danger that
pursues me . '
' is it not enough to know that they are servants of the enemy ? '
answered gildor . ' flee them ! speak no words to them ! they are deadly . ask no
more of me ! but my heart [???] that [???] ere all is ended [???] you [???] [???] son of
drogo [???] will know more of these fell things than gildor [???] . may
[???] protect you ! '
' but where shall i find courage ? ' asked [???] . ' that is what i chiefly
need . '
' courage is found in unlikely places [???] ' said gildor . ' be of good hope !
sleep now ! in the morning we shall have gone ; but we will send our messages

through the lands . the wandering companies shall know of your journey [???]
and
those that have power for good shall be on the watch . i name you elf - friend ;
and may the stars shine upon the end of your road ! seldom have we had such
delight in strangers [???] and it is fair to hear words of the ancient speech
from the lips of other wanderers in the world . '
[???] felt sleep coming upon him [???] even as gildor finished speaking . ' i
will sleep now [???] ' he said ; and the elf led him to a bower beside [???] [???] and
he threw himself upon a bed and fell at once into a dreamless slumber .




chapter 4 . a short cut to [???]



in the morning [???] woke refreshed . he was lying in a bower made by a
living tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground ; his bed was of
fern and grass [???] deep and soft and strangely fragrant . the sun was shining
through the [???] leaves [???] which were still green upon the tree . he
jumped up and went out .
sam was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wood . [???] was
standing studying the sky and weather . there was no sign of the elves .
' they have left us fruit and drink [???] and bread [???] ' said [???] . ' come and
have your breakfast . the bread tastes almost as good as it did last night . i
did not want to leave you any [???] but sam insisted . '
[???] sat down beside sam and began to eat . ' wha t is the plan for
today ? ' asked [???] .
' to walk to [???] as quickly as possible [???] ' answered [???] [???] and
gave his attention to the food .
' do you think we shall see anything of those riders ? ' asked [???]
cheerfully . under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole troop of
them did not seem very alarming to him .
' yes [???] probably [???] ' said [???] [???] not liking the reminder . ' but i hope to
get across the river without their seeing us . '
' did you find out anything about them from gildor ? '
' not much - only hints and [???] [???] ' said [???] [???] . ' did you ask
about the [???] ? '
' we didn ' t discuss it [???] ' said [???] with his mouth full .
' you should have . i am sure it is very important . '
' in that case i am sure gildor would have refused to explain it [???] ' said
[???] sharply . ' and now leave me in peace for a bit ! i don ' t want to answer
a string of questions while i am eating . i want to think ! '
' good heavens ! ' said [???] . ' at breakfast ? ' he walked away towards the
edge of the green .
from [???] ' s mind the bright morning - treacherously bright [???] he thought
- had not banished the fear of pursuit ; and he pondered the words of gildor .
the merry voice of [???] came to him . he was running on the green turf and
singing .

' no ! i could not ! ' he said to himself . ' it is one thing to take my
young friends walking over the shire with me [???] until we are hungry and weary [???]
and food and bed are sweet . to take them into exile [???] where hunger and
weariness may ha ve no cure [???] is quite another - even if they are willing to
come . the inheritance is mine alone . i don ' t think i ought even to take
sam . ' he looked at sam [???] [???] and discovered that sam was watching him .
' well [???] sam ! ' he said . ' what about it ? i am leaving the shire as soon as
ever i can - in fact i have made up my mind now not even to wait a day at
[???] [???] if it can be helped . '
' very good [???] sir ! '
' you still mean to come with me ? '
' i do . '
' it is going to be very dangerous [???] sam . ' it is already dangerous . most
likely neither of us will come back . '
' if you don ' t come back [???] sir [???] then i shan ' t [???] that ' s certain [???] ' said sam .
' don ' t you leave him ! they said to me . leave him ! i said . i never mean to . i
am going with him [???] if he climbs to the moon [???] and if any of those black
rulers try to stop him [???] they ' ll have sam [???] to reckon with [???] i said . they
laughed . '
' who are they [???] and what are you talking about ? '
' the elves [???] sir . we had some talk last night ; and they seemed to know
you were going away [???] so i didn ' t see the use of denying it . wonderful folk [???]
elves [???] sir ! wonderful ! '
' they are [???] ' said [???] . ' do you like them still [???] now you have had a
closer view ? '
' they seem a bit above my likes and dislikes [???] so to speak [???] ' answered
sam slowly . ' it don ' t seem to matter what i think about them . they are quite
different from what i expected - so old and young [???] and so gay and sad [???] as it
were . '
[???] looked at sam rather startled [???] half expecting to see some outward
sign of the odd change that seemed to have come over him . it did not sound
like the voice of the old sam [???] that he thought he knew . but it looked
like the old sam [???] sitting there [???] except that his face was unusually
thoughtful .
' do you feel any need to leave the shire now - now that your wish to
see them has come true already ? ' he asked .
' yes [???] sir . i don ' t know how to say it [???] but after last night i feel

different . i seem to see ahead [???] in a kind of way . i know we are going to
take a very long road [???] into darkness ; but i know i can ' t turn back . it isn ' t
to see elves now [???] nor dragons [???] nor mountains [???] that i want - i don ' t rightly
know what i want : but i have something to do before the end [???] and it lies
ahead [???] not in the shire . i must see it through [???] sir [???] if you understand me . '
' i don ' t altogether . but i understand that [???] chose me a good
companion . i am content . we will go together . '
[???] finished his breakfast in silence . then standing up he looked
over the land ahead [???] and called to [???] .
' all ready to start ? ' he said as [???] ran up . ' we must be getting off
at once . we slept late ; and there are a good many miles to go . '
' you slept late [???] you mean [???] ' said [???] . ' i was up long before ; and we
are only waiting for you to finish eating and thinking . '
' i have finished both now . and i am going to make for [???] ferry
as quickly as possible . i am not going out of the way [???] back to the road we
left last night : i am going to cut straight across country from here . '
' then you are going to fly [???] ' said [???] . ' you won ' t cut straight on
foot anywhere in this country . '
' we can cut straighter than the road anyway [???] ' answered [???] . ' the
ferry is east from [???] ; but the hard road curves away to the left - you
can see a bend of it away north over there . it goes round the north end of
the marish so as to strike the causeway from the bridge above stock . but
that is miles out of the way . we could save a quarter of the distance if we
made a line for the ferry from where we stand . '
' short cuts make long delays [???] ' argued [???] . ' the country is rough
round here [???] and there are bogs and all kinds of difficulties down in the
marish - i know the land in these parts . and if you are [???] about black
riders [???] i can ' t see that it is any worse meeting them on a road than in a
wood or a field . '
' it is less easy to find people in the woods and fields [???] ' answered
[???] . ' and if you are supposed to be on the road [???] there is some chance that
you will be looked for on the road and not off it . '
' all right ! ' said [???] . ' i will follow you into every bog and ditch .
but it is hard ! i had counted on passing the golden perch at stock before
sundown . the best beer in the [???] [???] or used to be : it is a long time
since i tasted it . '
' that settles it ! ' said [???] . ' short cuts make delays [???] but inns make

longer ones . at all costs we must keep you away from the golden perch . we
want to get to [???] before dark . what do you say [???] sam ? '
' i will go along with you [???] mr . [???] [???] ' said sam ( in spite of private
[???] and a deep regret for the best beer in the [???] ) .
' then if we are going to toil through bog and briar [???] let ' s go now ! '
said [???] .
it was already nearly as hot as it had been the day before ; but clouds
were beginning to come up from the west . it looked likely to turn to rain .
the [???] [???] down a steep green bank and [???] into the thick
trees below . their course had been chosen to leave [???] to their left [???]
and to cut [???] through the woods that [???] along the eastern side
of the hills [???] until they reached the flats beyond . then they could make
straight for the ferry over country that was open [???] except for a few ditches
and fences . [???] reckoned they had eighteen miles to go in a straight line .
he soon found that the thicket was closer and more tangled than it had
appeared . there were no paths in the [???] [???] and they did not get on
very fast . when they had struggled to the bottom of the bank [???] they found a
stream running down from the hills behind in a deeply dug bed with steep
slippery sides [???] with [???] . most [???] it cut across the
line they had chosen . they could not jump over it [???] nor indeed get across it
at all without getting wet [???] scratched [???] and muddy . they halted [???] wondering
what to do . ' first check ! ' said [???] [???] smiling grimly .
sam [???] looked back . through an opening in the trees he caught a
glimpse of the top of the green bank from which they had climbed down .
' look ! ' he said [???] clutching [???] by the arm . they all looked [???] and on
the edge high above them they saw against the sky a horse standing . beside
it stooped a black figure .
they at once gave up any idea of going back . [???] led the way [???] and
[???] quickly into the thick bushes beside the stream . ' whew ! ' he said to
[???] . ' we were both right ! the short cut has gone crooked already ; but we
got under cover only just in time . you ' ve got sharp ears [???] sam : can you hear
anything coming ? '
they stood still [???] almost holding their breath as they listened ; but
there was no sound of pursuit . ' i don ' t fancy he would try bringing his
hor se down that bank [???] ' said sam . ' but i guess he knows we came down it . we
had better be going on . '
going on was not altogether easy . they had packs to carry [???] and the

bushes and [???] were [???] to let them through . they were cut off
from the wind by the ridge behind [???] and the air was still and stuffy . when
they forced their way at last into more open ground [???] they were hot and tired
and very scratched [???] and they were also no longer certain of the direction in
which they were going . the banks of the stream sank [???] as it reached the
levels and became broader and shallower [???] wandering off towards the marish
and the river .
' why [???] this is the stock - brook ! ' said [???] . ' if we are going to try
and get back on to our course [???] we must cross at once and bear right . '
they waded the stream [???] and hurried over a wide open space [???] rush - grown
and treeless [???] on the further side . beyond that they came again to a belt of
trees : tall oaks [???] for the most part [???] with here and there an elm tree or an
ash . the ground was fairly level [???] and there was little [???] ; but the
trees were loo close for them to see far ahead . the leaves blew upwards in
sudden gusts of wind [???] and spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky .
then the wind died away and the rain came streaming down . they [???]
along
as fast as they could [???] over patches of grass [???] and through thick drifts of
old leaves ; and all about them the rain pattered and trickled . they did not
talk [???] but kept glancing back [???] and from side to side .
after half an hour [???] said : ' i hope we have not turned too much
towards the south [???] and are not walking longwise through this wood ! it is not
a very broad belt - - i should have said no more than a mile at the widest -
and we ought to have been through it by now . '
' it is no good our starting to go in zig - [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' that won ' t
mend matters . let us keep on as we are going ! i am not sure that i want to
come out into the open yet . '
they went on for perhaps another couple of miles . then the sun gleamed
out of ragged clouds again and the rain lessened . it was now past mid - day [???]
and they felt it was high time for lunch . they halted under an elm tree : its
leaves though fast turning yellow were still thick [???] and the ground at its
feel was fairly dry and sheltered . when they came to make their meal [???] they
found that the elves had filled their bottles with a clear drink [???] pale
golden in colour : it had the scent of a honey made of many flowers [???] and was
wonderfully refreshing . very soon they were laughing [???] and snapping their
fingers at rain [???] and at black riders . the last few miles [???] they felt [???] would
soon be behind them .

[???] propped his back against the tree - trunk [???] and closed his eyes . sam
and [???] sat near [???] and they began to hum [???] and then to sing softly :
ho ! ho ! ho ! to the bottle i go
to heal my heart and drown my woe .
rain may fall and wind may blow [???]
and many miles be still to go [???]
but under a tall tree i will lie [???]
and let the clouds go sailing by .
ho ! ho ! ho ! they began again louder . they stopped short suddenly . [???]
sprang to his feet . a long - drawn wail came down the wind [???] like the cry of
some evil and lonely creature . it rose and fell [???] and ended on a high
piercing note . even as they sat and stood [???] as if suddenly frozen [???] it was
answered by another cry [???] fainter and further off [???] but no less chilling to
the blood . there was then a silence [???] broken only by the sound of the wind in
the leaves .
' and what do you think that was ? ' [???] asked at last [???] trying to speak
lightly [???] but [???] a little . ' if it was a bird [???] it was one that i never
heard in the shire before . '
' it was not bird or beast [???] ' said [???] . ' it was a call [???] or a signal - -
there were words in that cry [???] though i could not catch them . but no hobbit
has such a voice . '
no more was said about it . they were all thinking of the riders [???] but no
one spoke of them . they were now [???] either to stay or go on ; but
sooner or later they had got to get across the open country to the ferry [???]
and it was best to go sooner and in daylight . in a few moments they had
shouldered their packs again and were off .
before long the wood came to a sudden end . wide grass - lands stretched
before them . they now saw that they had [???] in fact [???] turned too much to the
south . away over the flats they could glimpse the low hill of [???]
across the river [???] but it was now to their left . creeping [???] out from
the edge of the trees [???] they set off across the open as quickly as they
could .
at first they felt afraid [???] away from the shelter of the wood . far back
behind them stood the high place where they had breakfasted . [???] half
expected to see the small distant figure of a horseman on the ridge dark
against the sky ; but there was no sign of one . the sun escaping from the
breaking clouds [???] as it sank towards the hills they had left [???] was now shining

brightly again . their fear left them [???] though they still felt uneasy . but the
land became steadily more tame and well - ordered . soon they came into
well - tended fields and [???] : there were hedges and gates and dikes for
[???] . everything seemed quiet and peaceful [???] just an ordinary corner of
the shire . their spirits rose with every step . the line of the river grew
nearer ; and the black riders began to seem like [???] of the woods now
left far behind .
they passed along the edge of a huge turnip - field [???] and came to a stout
gate . beyond it a rutted lane ran between low well - laid hedges towards a
distant clump of trees . [???] stopped .
' i know these fields and this gate ! ' he said . ' this is [???] [???] old
farmer [???] ' s land . that ' s his farm away there in the trees . '
' one trouble after another ! ' said [???] [???] looking nearly as much alarmed
as if [???] had declared the lane was the slot leading to a dragon ' s den .
the others looked at him in surprise .
' what ' s wrong with old [???] ? ' asked [???] . ' he ' s a good friend to
all the brandy bucks . of course he ' s a terror to trespassers [???] and keeps
[???] dogs - but after all [???] folk down here are near the border and have
to be more on their guard . '
' i know [???] ' said [???] . ' but all the same [???] ' he added with a [???]
laugh [???] ' i am terrified of him and his dogs . i have avoided his farm for
years and years . he caught me several times trespassing after [???] [???]
when i was a youngster at brandy hall . on the last occasion he beat me [???] and
then took me and showed me to his dogs . [???] see [???] lads [???] [???] he said [???] [???] next time
this young [???] sets foot on my land [???] you can eat him . now see him off ! [???]
they chased me all the way to the ferry . i have never got over the fright -
though i daresay the beasts knew their business and would not really have
touched me . '
[???] laughed . ' well [???] it ' s time you made it up . especially if you are
coming back to live in buckland . old [???] is really a stout fellow - if
you leave his [???] alone . let ' s get into the lane and then we shan ' t be
trespassing . if we meet him [???] i ' ll do the talking . he is a friend of merry ' s [???]
and i used to come here with him a good deal at one time . '
they went along the lane [???] until they saw the thatched roofs of a large
house and farm - buildings peeping ou t among the trees ahead . the [???] [???]
and
the [???] of stock [???] and most of the inhabitants of the marish [???] were

house - dwellers ; and this farm was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall
all round it . there was a wide wooden gate opening out of the wall into the
lane .
suddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baying and barking broke out [???]
and a loud voice was heard shouting : ' grip ! fang ! wolf ! come on [???] lads ! '
[???] and sam stopped dead [???] but [???] walked on a few paces . the gate
opened and three huge dogs came pelting out into the lane [???] and dashed
towards the travellers [???] barking fiercely . they took no notice of [???] ; but
sam shrank against the wall [???] while two wolvish - looking dogs [???] at him
suspiciously [???] and [???] if he moved . the largest and most [???] of the
three halted in front of [???] [???] [???] and growling .
through the gate there now appeared a broad thick - set hobbit with a
round red face . ' hallo ! hallo ! and who may you be [???] and what may you be
wanting ? ' he asked .
' good afternoon [???] mr . [???] ! ' said [???] .
the farmer looked at him closely . ' well [???] if it isn ' t master [???] -
mr . [???] took [???] i should say ! ' he cried [???] changing from a [???] to a grin .
' it ' s a long time since i saw you round here . it ' s lucky for you that i know
you . i was just going out to set my dogs on any strangers . there are some
funny things going on today . of course [???] we do get queer folk wandering in
these parts at times . too near the river [???] ' he said [???] shaking his head . ' but
this fellow was the most [???] i have ever set eyes on . he won ' t cross
my land without leave a second time [???] not if i can stop it . '
' what fellow do you mean ? ' asked [???] .
' then you haven ' t seen him ? ' said the farmer . ' h e went up the lane
towards the causeway not a long while back . he was a funny customer and
asking funny questions . but perhaps you ' ll come along inside [???] and we ' ll pass
the news more comfortable . i ' ve a drop of good ale on tap [???] if you and your
friends are willing [???] mr . took . '
it seemed plain that the farmer would tell them more [???] if allowed to do
it in his own time and fashion [???] so they all accepted the invitation . ' what
about the dogs ? ' asked [???] anxiously .
the farmer laughed . ' they won ' t harm you - not unless i tell ' em to .
here [???] grip ! fang ! heel ! ' he cried . ' heel [???] wolf ! ' to the relief of [???] and
sam [???] the dogs walked away and let them go free .
[???] introduced the other two to the farmer . ' mr . [???] [???] [???] ' he
said . ' you may not remember him [???] but he used to live at brandy hall . ' at the

name [???] the farmer started [???] and gave [???] a sharp glance . for a moment
[???] thought that the memory of stolen [???] had been [???] [???] and
that
the dogs would be told to see him off . but farmer [???] took him by the
arm .
' well [???] if that isn ' t [???] than ever ? ' he exclaimed . ' mr . [???] is
it ? come inside ! we must have a talk . '
they went into the farmer ' s kitchen [???] and sat by the wide fire - place .
mrs . [???] brought out beer in a huge jug [???] and filled four large mugs . it
was a good brew [???] and [???] found himself more than [???] for
missing
the golden perch . sam sipped his beer suspiciously . he had a natural
mistrust of the inhabitants of other parts of the shire ; and also he was not
disposed to be quick friends with anyone who had beaten his master [???] however
long ago .
after a few remarks about the weather and the [???] prospects
( which were no worse than usual ) [???] farmer [???] put down his mug and
looked
at them all in turn .
' now [???] mr . [???] [???] ' he said [???] ' where might you be coming from [???] and
where might you be going to ? were you coming to visit ' me ? for [???] if so [???] you
had gone past my gate without my seeing you . '
' well [???] no [???] ' answered [???] . ' to tell you the truth [???] since you have
guessed it [???] we got into the lane from the other end : we had come over your
fields . but that was quite by accident . we lost our way in the woods [???] back
near [???] [???] trying to take a short cu t to the ferry . '
' if you were in a hurry [???] the road would have served you better [???] ' said
the farmer . ' but i wasn ' t [???] about that . you have leave to walk over
my land [???] if you have a mind [???] mr . [???] . and you [???] mr . [???] - though i
daresay you still like [???] . ' he laughed . ' ah yes [???] i recognized the
name . i [???] the time when young [???] [???] was one of the worst
young rascals of buckland . but it wasn ' t [???] i was thinking of . i had
just heard the name [???] before you turned up . what do you think that
funny customer asked me ? '
they waited anxiously for him to go on . ' well [???] ' the farmer continued [???]
approaching his point with slow relish [???] ' he came riding on a big black horse
in at the gate [???] which happened to be open [???] and right up to my door . all

black he was himself [???] too [???] and cloaked and hooded up [???] as if he did not want
to be known . [???] now what in the shire can he want ? [???] i thought to myself . we
don ' t see many of the big folk over the border ; and [???] y i had never heard
of any like this black fellow .
' [???] good - day to you ! [???] i says [???] going out to him . [???] this lane don ' t lead
anywhere [???] and wherever you may be going [???] your quickest way will be back to
the road . [???] i didn ' t like the looks of him ; and when grip came out [???] he took
one sniff and let out a [???] as if he had been slung : he put down his tail
and bolted off howling . the black fellow sat quite still .
' [???] i come from yonder [???] [???] he said [???] slow and stiff - like [???] pointing back
west [???] over my fields [???] if you please . [???] have you seen [???] ? [???] he asked in a
queer voice [???] and bent down towards me . i could not see any face [???] for his
hood fell down so low ; and i felt a sort of shiver down my back . but i did
not see why he should come riding over my land so bold .
' [???] be off ! [???] i said . [???] there are no [???] here . you ' re in the wrong
part of the shire . you had better go back west to [???] - but you can go
by road this time . [???]
' [???] [???] has left [???] [???] he answered in a whisper . [???] he is coming . he is
not far away . i wish to find him . if he passes will you tell me ? i will come
back with gold . [???]
' [???] no you won ' t [???] [???] i said . [???] you ' ll go back where you belong [???] double
quick . i give you one minute before i call all my dogs . [???]
' he gave a sort of hiss . it might have been laughing [???] and it might not .
then he spurred his great horse right at me [???] and i jumped out of the way
only just in time . i called the dogs [???] but he swung off [???] and rode through the
gate and up the lane towards the causeway like a bolt of thunder . what do
you think of that ? '
[???] sat for a moment looking at the fire [???] but his only thought was
how on earth would they reach the ferry . ' i don ' t know what to think [???] ' he
said at last .
' then i ' ll tell you what to think [???] ' said [???] . ' you should never have
gone mixing yourself up with [???] folk [???] mr . [???] . folk are queer up
there . ' sam stirred in his chair [???] and looked at the farmer with an
[???] eye . ' but you were always a reckless lad . when i heard you had
left the [???] and gone off to that old mr . [???] [???] i said that you
were going to find trouble . mark my words [???] this all comes of those strange
doings of mr . [???] ' s . his money was got in some strange fashion in foreign

parts [???] they say . maybe there is some that want to know what has become of
the gold and jewels that he buried in the hill of [???] [???] as i hear ? '
[???] said nothing : the shrewd guesses of the farmer were rather
[???] .
' well [???] mr . [???] [???] ' [???] went on [???] ' i ' m glad that you ' ve had the sense
to come back to buckland . my advice is : stay there ! and don ' t get mixed up
with these [???] folk . you ' ll have friends in these parts . if any of
these black fellows come after you again [???] i ' ll deal with them . i ' ll say
you ' re dead [???] or have left the shire [???] or anything you like . and that might be
true enough ; for as like as not it is old mr . [???] they want news of . '
' maybe you ' re right [???] ' said [???] [???] avoiding the farmer ' s eye and staring
at the fire .
[???] looked at him thoughtfully . ' well [???] i see you have ideas of your
own [???] ' he said . ' it is as plain as my nose that no accident brought you and
that rider here on the same afternoon ; and maybe my news was no great news
to you [???] after all . i am not asking you to tell me anything you have a mind
to keep to yourself ; but i see you are in some kind of trouble . perhaps you
are thinking it won ' t be too easy to get to the ferry without being caught ? '
' i was thinking so [???] ' said [???] . ' but we have got to try and get there ;
and it won ' t be done by sitting and thinking . so i am afraid we must be
going . thank you very much indeed for your kindness ! i ' ve been in terror of
you and your dogs for over thirty years [???] farmer [???] [???] though you may laugh
to hear it . it ' s a pity : for i ' ve missed a good friend . and now i ' m sorry to
leave so soon . but i ' ll come back [???] perhaps [???] one day - if i get a chance . '
' you ' ll be welcome when you come [???] ' said [???] . ' but now i ' ve a notion .
it ' s near sundown already [???] and we are going to have our supper ; for we
mostly go to bed soon after the sun . if you and mr . [???] and all could
stay and have a bite with us [???] we would be pleased ! '
' and so should we ! ' said [???] . ' but we must be going at once [???] i ' m
afraid . even now it will be dark before we can reach the ferry . '
' ah ! but wait a minute ! i was going to say : after a bit of supper [???] i ' ll
gel out a small waggon [???] and i ' ll drive you all to the ferry . that will save
you a good step [???] and it might also save you trouble of another sort . '
[???] now accepted the invitation gratefully [???] to the relief of [???]
and sam . the sun was already behind the western hills [???] and the light was
failing . two of [???] ' s sons and his three daughters came in [???] and a
generous supper was laid on the large table . the kitchen was lit with

candles and the fire was mended . mrs . [???] hustled in and out . one or two
other [???] belonging to the farm - household came in . in a short while
fourteen sat down to eat . there was beer in plenty [???] and a mighty dish of
[???] and bacon [???] besides much other solid farmhouse fare . the dogs lay
by the fire and gnawed [???] and cracked bones .
when they had finished [???] the farmer and his sons went out with a lantern
and got the waggon ready . it was dark in the yard [???] when the guests came out .
they threw their packs on board and climbed in . the farmer sat in the
driving - seat [???] and whipped up his two stout [???] . his wife stood in the
light of the open door .
' you be careful of yourself . [???] ! ' she called . ' don ' t go [???]
with any foreigners [???] and come straight back ! '
' i will ! ' said he [???] and drove out of the gate . there was now no breath
of wind stirring ; the night was still and quiet [???] and a chill was in the air .
they went without lights and took it slowly . after a mile or two the lane
came to an end [???] crossing a deep dike [???] and climbing a short slope up on to
the high - banked causeway .
[???] got down and took a good look either way [???] north and south [???] but
nothing could be seen in the darkness [???] and there was not a sound in the
still air . thin [???] of river - mist were hanging above the dikes [???] and
[???] over the fields .
' it ' s going to be thick [???] ' said [???] ; ' but i ' ll not light my lantern
till i turn for home . we ' ll hear anything on the road long before we meet it
tonight . '
it was five miles or more from [???] ' s lane to the ferry . the [???]
wrapped themselves up [???] but their ears were strained for any sound above the
creak of the wheels and the slow clop of the [???] ' [???] . the waggon
seemed slower than a snail to [???] . beside him [???] was nodding towards
sleep ; but sam was staring forwards into the rising fog .
they reached the entrance to the ferry lane at last . it was marked by
two tall white posts that suddenly loomed up on their right . farmer [???]
drew in his [???] and the waggon creaked to a halt . they were just
beginning lo scramble out [???] when suddenly they heard what they had all been
dreading : [???] on the road ahead . the sound was coming towards them .
[???] jumped down and stood holding the [???] ' heads [???] and peering
forward into the gloom . clip - clop [???] clip - clop came the approaching rider . the
fall of the [???] sounded loud in the still [???] [???] air .

' you ' d better be hidden [???] mr . [???] [???] ' said sam anxiously . ' you get down
in the waggon and cover up with blankets [???] and we ' ll send this rider to the
rightabouts ! ' he climbed out and went to the farmer ' s side . black riders
would have to ride over him to get near the waggon .
clop - clop [???] clop - clop . the rider was nearly on them .
' hallo there ! ' called farmer [???] . the advancing [???] stopped short .
they thought they could dimly guess a dark cloaked shape in the mist [???] a yard
or two ahead . ' now then ! ' said the farmer [???] throwing the reins to sam and
striding forward . ' don ' t you come a step nearer ! what do you want [???] and where
are you going ? '
' i want mr . [???] . have you seen him ? ' sa id a muffled voice - but the
voice was the voice of merry [???] . a dark lantern was uncovered [???] and
its light fell on the astonished face of the farmer .
' mr . merry ! ' he cried .
' yes [???] of course ! who did you think it was ? ' said merry coming forward .
as he came out of the mist and their fears [???] [???] he seemed suddenly to
diminish to ordinary hobbit - size . he was riding a pony [???] and a scarf was
[???] round his neck and over his chin to keep out the fog .
[???] sprang out of the waggon to greet him . ' so there you are at
last ! ' said merry . ' i was beginning to wonder if you would turn up at all
today [???] and i was just going back to supper . when it grew [???] i came across
and rode up towards stock to see if you had fallen in any ditches . but i ' m
blest if i know which way you have come . where did you find them [???] mr .
[???] ? in your duck - pond ? '
' no [???] i caught ' em trespassing [???] ' said the farmer [???] ' and nearly set my
dogs on ' em ; but they ' ll tell you all the story [???] i ' ve no doubt . now [???] if
you ' ll excuse me [???] mr . merry and mr . [???] and all [???] i ' d best be turning for
home . mrs . [???] will be [???] with the night getting thick . '
he backed the waggon into the lane and turned it . ' well [???] good night to
you all [???] ' he said . ' it ' s been a queer day [???] and no mistake . but all ' s well as
ends well ; though perhaps we should not say that until we reach our own
doors . i ' ll not deny that i ' ll be glad now when i do . ' he lit his lanterns [???]
and got up . suddenly he produced a large basket from under the seat . ' i was
nearly forgetting [???] ' he said . ' mrs . [???] put this up for mr . [???] [???] with
her compliments . ' he handed it down and moved off [???] followed by a chorus of
thanks and good - nights .
they watched the pale rings of light round his lanterns as they

[???] into the [???] night . suddenly [???] laughed : from the covered
basket he held [???] the scent of [???] was rising .




chapter 5 . a conspiracy [???]



' now we had better get home ourselves [???] ' said merry . there ' s something
funny about all this [???] i see ; but it must wait till we get in . '
they turned down the ferry lane [???] which was straight and well - kept and
edged with large white - washed stones . in a hundred yards or so it brought
them to the river - bank [???] where there was a broad wooden landing - stage . a
large flat ferry - boat was moored beside it . the white [???] near the
water ' s edge [???] in the light of two lamps on high posts . behind them
the mists in the flat fields were now above the hedges ; but the water before
them was dark [???] with only a few curling wisps like steam among the reeds by
the bank . there seemed to be less fog on the further side .
merry led the pony over a [???] on to the ferry [???] and the others
followed . merry then pushed slowly off with a long pole . the [???]
flowed slow and broad before them . on the other side the bank was steep [???] and
up it a winding path climbed from the further landing . lamps were [???]
there . behind loomed up the buck hill ; and out of it [???] through stray shrouds
of mist [???] shone many round windows [???] yellow and red . they were the windows
of
brandy hall [???] the ancient home of the [???] .
long ago [???] [???] [???] head of the [???] family [???] one of the
oldest in the marish or indeed in the shire [???] had crossed the river [???] which
was the original boundary of the land eastwards . he built ( and [???] )
brandy hall [???] changed his name to [???] [???] and settled down to become
master of what was virtually a small [???] country . his family grew
and grew [???] and after his days continued to grow [???] until brandy hall occupied
the whole of the low hill [???] and had three large front - doors [???] many side - doors [???]
and about a hundred windows . the [???] and their [???]
dependants
then began to burrow [???] and later to build [???] all round about . that was the
origin of buckland [???] a thickly inhabited strip between the river and the old
forest [???] a sort of colony from the shire . its chief village was [???] [???]
[???] in the banks and [???] behind brandy hall .
the people in the marish were friendly with the [???] [???] and the
authority of the master of the hall ( as the head of the [???] family

was called ) was still acknowledged by the farmers between stock and rushey .
but most of the folk of the old shire regarded the [???] as peculiar [???]
half foreigners as it were . though [???] as a matter of fact [???] they were not very
different from the other [???] of the four farthings . except in one point :
they were fond of boats [???] and some of them could swim .
their land was originally [???] from the east ; but on that side
they had built a hedge : the high hay . it had been planted many generations
ago [???] and was now thick and tail [???] for it was constantly tended . it ran all
the way from [???] bridge [???] in a big loop curving away from the river [???]
to [???] ( where the [???] flowed out of the forest into the
[???] ) : well over twenty miles from end to end . but [???] of course [???] it was
not a complete protection . the forest drew close to the hedge in many
places . the [???] kept their doors locked after dark [???] and that also
was not usual in the shire .
the ferry - boat moved slowly across the water . the buckland shore drew
nearer . sam was the only member of the party who had not been over the river
before . he had a strange feeling as the slow [???] stream slipped by : his
old life lay behind in the mists [???] dark adventure lay in front . he scratched
his head [???] and for a moment had a passing wish that mr . [???] could have gone
on living quietly at bag end .
the four [???] stepped off the ferry . merry was tying it up [???] and
[???] was already leading the pony up the path [???] when sam ( who had been
looking ba ck [???] as if to take farewell of the shire ) said in a hoarse whisper :
' look back [???] mr . [???] ! do you see anything ? '
on the far stage [???] under the distant lamps [???] they could just make out a
figure : it looked like a dark black bundle left behind . but a s they looked
it seemed to move and sway this way and that [???] as if searching the ground . it
then [???] [???] or went [???] [???] back into the gloom beyond the lamps .
' what in the shire is that ? ' exclaimed merry .
' something that is following us [???] ' said [???] . ' but don ' t ask any more
now ! let ' s get away at once ! ' they hurried up the path to the top of the
bank [???] but when they looked back the far shore was shrouded in mist [???] and
nothing could be seen .
' thank goodness you don ' t keep any boats on the west - bank ! ' said [???] .
' can horses cross the river ? '
' they can go twenty miles north to [???] bridge - or they might
swim [???] ' answered merry . ' though i never heard of any horse swimming the

[???] . but what have horses to do with it ? ' i ' ll tell you later . let ' s
get [???] and then we can talk . '
' all right ! you and [???] know your way ; so i ' ll just ride on and tell
fatty bolger that you are coming . we ' ll see about supper and things . '
' we had our supper early with farmer [???] [???] ' said [???] ; ' but we could
do with another . '
' you shall have it ! give me that basket ! ' said merry [???] and rode ahead
into the darkness .
it was some distance from the [???] to [???] ' s new house at
[???] . they passed buck hill and brandy hall on their left [???] and on the
[???] of [???] struck the main road of buckland that ran south from
the bridge . half a mile northward along this they came to a lane opening on
their right . this they followed for a couple of miles as it climbed up and
down into the country .
at last they came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge . nothing could be
seen of the house in the dark : it stood back from the lane in the middle of
a wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of low trees inside the outer
hedge . [???] had chosen it [???] because it stood in an out - of - the - way corner of
the country [???] and there were no other dwellings close by . you could get in
and out without being noticed . it had been built a long while before by the
[???] [???] for the use of guests [???] or members of the family that wished to
escape from the crowded life of brandy hall for a time . it was an
old - fashioned [???] house [???] as much like a hobbit - hole as possible : it
was long and low [???] with no upper storey ; and it had a roof of turf [???] round
windows [???] and a large round door .
as they walked lip the green path from the gate no light was visible ;
the windows were dark and shuttered . [???] knocked on the door [???] and fatty
bolger opened it . a friendly light streamed out . they slipped in quickly and
shut themselves and the light inside . they were in a wide hall with doors on
either side ; in front of them a passage ran back down the middle of the
house .
' well [???] what do you think of it ? ' asked merry coming up the passage . ' we
have done our best in a short time to make it look like home . after all
fatty and i only got here with the last cart - load yesterday . '
[???] looked round . it did look like home . many of his own favourite
things - or [???] ' s things ( they reminded him sharply of him in their new
selling ) - were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at bag end .

it was a pleasant [???] comfortable [???] welcoming place ; and he found himself
wishing that he was really coming here to settle down in quiet retirement .
it seemed unfair to have put his friends to all this trouble ; and he
wondered again how he was going to break the news to them that he must leave
them so soon [???] indeed at once . yet that would have to be done that very
night [???] before they all went to bed .
' it ' s delightful ! ' he said with an effort . ' i hardly feel that i have
moved at all . '
the travellers hung up their cloaks [???] and piled their packs on the
floor . merry led them down the passage and threw open a door at the far end .
firelight came out [???] and a puff of steam .
' a bath ! ' cried [???] . ' o blessed [???] ! '
' which order shall we go in ? ' said [???] . ' eldest first [???] or quickest
first ? you ' ll be last either way [???] master [???] . '
' trust me to arrange things better than that ! ' said merry . ' we can ' t
begin life at [???] with a quarrel over baths . in that room there are
three tubs [???] and a copper full of boiling water . there are also towels [???] mats
and soap . get inside [???] and be quick ! '
merry and fatty went into the kitchen on the other side of the passage [???]
and busied themselves with the final preparations for a late supper .
snatches of competing songs came from the bathroom mixed with the sound
of
[???] and [???] . the voice of [???] was suddenly lifted up above
the others in one of [???] ' s favourite bath - songs .
sing hey ! for the bath at close of day
that washes the weary mud away !
a loon is he that will not sing :
o ! water hot is a noble thing !

o ! sweet is the sound of falling rain [???]
and the brook that leaps from hill to plain ;
but better than rain or [???] streams
is water hot that smokes and steams .

o ! water cold we may pour at need
down a thirsty throat and be glad indeed ;
but better is beer [???] if drink we lack [???]

and water hot poured down the back .

o ! water is fair that leaps on high
in a fountain white beneath the sky ;
but never did fountain sound so sweet
as [???] hot water with my feet !
there was a terrific splash [???] and a shout of whoa ! from [???] . it
appeared that a lot of [???] ' s bath had imitated a fountain and leaped on
high .
merry went to the door : ' what about supper a nd beer in the throat ? ' he
called . [???] came out drying his hair .
' there ' s so much water in the air that i ' m coming into the kitchen to
finish [???] ' he said .
' lawks ! ' said merry [???] looking in . the stone floor was swimming . ' you
ought to mop all that up before you get anything to eat . [???] [???] ' he said .
' hurry up [???] or we shan ' t wait for you . '
they had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire . ' i suppose you
three won ' t want [???] again ? ' said [???] without much hope .
' yes we shall ! ' cried [???] .
' they ' re mine ! ' said [???] . ' given to me by mrs . [???] [???] a queen among
farmers ' wives . take your greedy hands away [???] and i ' ll serve them . '
[???] have a passion for [???] [???] [???] even the [???]
likings of big people . a fact which partly explains young [???] ' s long
expeditions to the renowned fields of the marish [???] and the wrath of the
injured [???] . on this occasion there was plenty for all [???] even according to
hobbit standards . there were also many other things to follow [???] and when they
had finished even fatty bolger heaved a sigh of content . they pushed back
the table [???] and drew chairs round the fire .
' we ' ll clear up later [???] ' said merry . ' now tell me all about it ! i guess
that you have been having adventures [???] which was not quite fair without me . i
want a full account ; and most of all i want to know what was the matter with
old [???] [???] and why he spoke to me like that . he sounded almost as if he was
scared [???] if that is possible . '
' we have all been scared [???] ' said [???] after a pause [???] in which [???]
stared at the fire and did not speak . ' you would have been [???] too [???] if you had
been chased for two days by black riders . '
' and what are they ? '

' black figures riding on black horses [???] ' answered [???] . ' if [???]
won ' t talk [???] i will tell you the whole tale from the beginning . ' he then gave
a full account of their journey from the time when they left [???] . sam
gave various supporting nods and [???] . [???] remained silent .
' i should think you were making it all up [???] ' said merry [???] ' if i had not
seen that black shape on the landing - stage - and heard the queer sound in
[???] ' s voice . what do you make of it all [???] [???] ? '
' cousin [???] has been very close [???] ' said [???] . ' but the time has come
for him to open out . so far we have been given nothing more to go on than
farmer [???] ' s guess that it has something to do with old [???] ' s
treasure . '
' that was only a guess [???] ' said [???] hastily . ' [???] does not know
anything . '
' old [???] is a shrewd fellow [???] ' said merry . ' a lot goes on behind his
round face that does not come out in his talk . i ' ve heard that he used to go
into the old forest at one time [???] and he has the reputation of knowing a good
many strange things . but you can at least tell us [???] [???] [???] whether you think
his guess good or bad . '
' i think [???] ' answered [???] slowly [???] ' that it was a good guess [???] as far as
it goes . there is a [???] with [???] ' s old adventures [???] and the riders
are looking [???] or perhaps one ought to say searching [???] for him or for me . i
also fear [???] if you want to know [???] that it is no joke at all ; and that i am not
safe here or anywhere else . ' he looked round at the windows and walls [???] as if
he was afraid they would su [???] give way . the others looked at him in
silence [???] and exchanged meaning glances among themselves .
' it ' s coming out in a minute [???] ' whispered [???] to merry . merry nodded .
' well ! ' said [???] at last [???] sitting up and straightening his back [???] as
if he had made a decision . ' i can ' t keep it dark any longer . i have got
something to tell you all . but i don ' t know quite how to begin . '
' i think i could help you [???] ' said merry quietly [???] ' by telling you some of
it myself . '
' what do you mean ? ' said [???] [???] looking at him anxiously . ' just this [???]
my dear old [???] : you are miserable [???] because you don ' t know how to say
good - bye . you meant to leave the shire [???] of course . but danger has come on
you sooner than you expected [???] and now you are making up your mind to go at
once . and you don ' t want to . we are very sorry for you . '
[???] opened his mouth and shut it again . his look of surprise was so

comical that they laughed . ' dear old [???] ! ' said [???] . ' did you really
think you had thrown dust in all our eyes ? you have not been nearly careful
or clever enough for that ! you have obviously been planning to go and saying
farewell to all your haunts all this year since april . we have constantly
heard you muttering : [???] shall i ever look down into that valley again [???] i
wonder [???] [???] and things like that . and pretending that you had come to the end
of your money [???] and actually selling your beloved bag end to those
sackville - [???] ! and all those close talks with [???] . '
' good heavens ! ' said [???] . ' i thought i had been both careful and
clever . i don ' t know what [???] would say . is all the shire discussing my
departure then ? '
' oh no ! ' said merry . ' don ' t worry about that ! the secret won ' t keep for
long [???] of course ; but at present it is [???] i think [???] only known to us
conspirators . after all [???] you must remember that we know you well [???] and are
often with you . we can usually guess what you are thinking . i knew [???] [???]
too . to tell you the truth [???] i had been watching you rather closely ever
since he left . i thought you would go after him sooner or later ; indeed i
expected you to go sooner [???] and lately we have been very anxious . we have
been terrified that you might give us the slip [???] and go off suddenly [???] all on
your own like he did . ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open [???] and
done a good deal of planning on our own account . you are not going to escape
so easily ! '
' but i must go [???] ' said [???] . ' it cannot be helped [???] dear friends . it is
wretched for us all [???] but it is no use your trying to keep me . since you have
guessed so much [???] please help me and do not hinder me ! '
' you do not understand ! ' said [???] . ' you must go - and therefore we
must [???] too . merry and i are coming with you . sam is an excellent fellow [???] and
would jump down a dragon ' s throat to save you [???] if he did not trip over his
own feet ; but you will need more than one companion in your dangerous
adventure . '
' my dear and most beloved [???] ! ' said [???] deeply moved . ' but i
could not allow it . i decided that long ago [???] too . you speak of danger [???] but
you do not understand . this is no treasure - hunt [???] no there - and - back journey .
i am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril . '
' of course we understand [???] ' said merry firmly . ' that is why we have
decided to come . we know the ring is no laughing - matter ; but we are going to
do our best to help you against the enemy . '

' the ring ! ' said [???] [???] now completely amazed .
' yes [???] the ring [???] ' said merry . ' my dear old hobbit [???] you don ' t allow for
the [???] of friends . i have known about the existence of the ring
for years - before [???] went away [???] in fact ; but since he obviously regarded
it as secret [???] i kept the knowledge in my head [???] until we formed our
conspiracy . i did not know [???] [???] of course [???] as well as i know you ; i was
too young [???] and he was also more careful - but he was not careful enough . if
you want to know how i first found out [???] i will tell you . '
' go on ! ' said [???] faintly .
' it was the sackville - [???] that were his downfall [???] as you might
expect . one day [???] a year before the party [???] i happened to be walking along the
road [???] when i saw [???] ahead . suddenly in the distance the s . - b . s appeared [???]
coming towards us . [???] slowed down [???] and then hey presto ! he vanished . i
was so startled that i hardly had the wits to hide myself in a more ordinary
fashion ; but i got through the hedge and walked along the field inside . i
was peeping through into the road [???] after the s . - b . s had passed [???] and was
looking straight at [???] when he suddenly reappeared . i caught a glint of
gold as he put something back in his trouser - pocket .
' after that i kept my eyes open . in fact [???] i confess that i spied . but
you must admit that it was very [???] [???] and i was only in my teens . i
must be the only one in the shire [???] besides you [???] [???] that has ever seen the
old fellow ' s secret book . '
' you have read his book ! ' cried [???] . ' good heavens above ! is nothing
safe ? '
' not too safe [???] i should say [???] ' said merry . ' but i have only had one
rapid glance [???] and that was difficult to get . he never left the book about . i
wonder what became of it . i should like another look . have you got it [???]
[???] ? '
' no . it was not at bag end . he must have taken it away . '
' well [???] as i was saying [???] ' merry proceeded [???] ' i kept my knowledge to
myself [???] till this spring when things got serious . then we formed our
conspiracy ; and as we were serious [???] too [???] and meant business [???] we have not
been too [???] . you are not a very easy nut to crack [???] and [???] is
worse . but if you want to be introduced to our chief [???] [???] i can
produce him . '
' where is he ? ' said [???] [???] looking round [???] as if he expected a masked
and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard .

' step forward [???] sam ! ' said merry ; and sam stood up with a face scarlet
up to the ears . ' here ' s our collector of information ! and he collected a
lot [???] i can tell you [???] before he was finally caught . after which [???] i may say [???]
he seemed to regard himself as on parole [???] and dried up . '
' sam ! ' cried [???] [???] feeling that amazement could go no further [???] and
quite unable to decide whether he felt angry [???] amused [???] relieved [???] or merely
foolish .
' yes [???] sir ! ' said sam . ' begging your pardon [???] sir ! but i meant no wrong
to you [???] mr . [???] [???] nor to mr . [???] for that matter . he has some sense [???]
mind you ; and when you said go alone [???] he said no ! lake someone as you can
trust . '
' but it does not seem that i can trust anyone [???] ' said [???] . sam looked
at him unhappily . ' it all depends on what you want [???] ' put in merry . ' you can
trust us to stick to you through thick and thin - to the bitter end . and you
can trust us to keep any secret of yours - closer than you keep it yourself .
but you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone [???] and go off without a
word . we are your friends [???] [???] . anyway : there it is . we know most of what
[???] has told you . we know a good deal about the ring . we are horribly
afraid - but we are coming with you ; or following you like hounds . '
' and after all [???] sir [???] ' added sam [???] ' you did ought to take the elves '
advice . gildor said you should take them as was willing [???] and you can ' t deny
it . '
' i don ' t deny it [???] ' said [???] [???] looking at sam [???] who was now grinning . ' i
don ' t deny it [???] but i ' ll never believe you are sleeping again [???] whether you
snore or not . i shall kick you hard to make sure .
' you are a set of deceitful [???] ! ' he said [???] turning to the
others . ' but bless you ! ' he laughed [???] getting up and waving his arms [???] ' i give
in . i will take gildor ' s advice . if the danger were not so dark [???] i should
dance for joy . even so [???] i cannot help feeling happy ; happier than i have
felt for a long time . i had dreaded this evening . '
' good ! that ' s settled . three cheers for captain [???] and company ! '
they shouted ; and they danced round him . merry and [???] began a song [???]
which they had apparently got ready for the occasion .
it was made on the model of the dwarf - song that started [???] on his
adventure long ago [???] and went to the same tune :
farewell we call to hearth and hall !
though wind may blow and rain may fall [???]

we must away ere break of day
far over wood and mountain tall .

to [???] [???] where elves yet dwell
in glades beneath the misty fell [???]
through moor and waste we ride in haste [???]
and whither then we cannot tell .

with foes ahead [???] behind us dread [???]
beneath the sky shall be our bed [???]
until at last our toil be passed [???]
our journey done [???] our errand sped .

we must away ! we must away !
we ride before the break of day !
' very good ! ' said [???] . ' but in that case there are a lot of things to
do before we go to bed - under a roof [???] for tonight at any rate . '
' oh ! that was poetry ! ' said [???] . ' do you really mean to start before
the break of day ? '
' i don ' t know [???] ' answered [???] . ' i fear those black riders [???] and i am
sure it is unsafe to stay in one place long [???] especially in a place to which
it is known i was going . also gildor advised me not to wait . but i should
very much like to see [???] . i could see that even gildor was disturbed
when he heard that [???] had never appeared . it really depends on two
things . how soon could the riders get to [???] ? and how soon could
we
get off ? it will take a good deal of preparation . '
' the answer to the second question [???] ' said merry [???] ' is that we could get
off in an hour . i have prepared practically everything . there are six [???]
in a stable across the fields ; stores and tackle are all packed [???] except for
a few extra clothes [???] and the perishable food . '
' it seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy [???] ' said [???] . ' but
what about the black riders ? would it be safe to wait one day for [???] ? '
' that all depends on what you think the riders would do [???] if they found
you here [???] ' answered merry . ' they could have reached here by now [???] of course [???]
if they were not stopped at the north - gate [???] where the hedge runs down to the
river - bank [???] just this side of the bridge . the gate - guards would not let them

through by night [???] though they might break through . even in the daylight they
would try to keep them out [???] i think [???] at any rate until they got a message
through to the master of the hall - for they would not like the look of the
riders [???] and would certainly be frightened by them . but [???] of course [???] buckland
cannot resist a determined attack for long . and it is possible that in the
morning even a black rider that rode up and asked for mr . [???] would be
let through . it is pretty generally known that you are coming back to live
at [???] . '
[???] sat for a while in thought . ' i have made up my mind [???] ' he said
finally . ' i am starting tomorrow [???] as soon as it is light . but i am not going
by road : it would be safer to wait here than that . if i go through the
north - gate my departure from buckland will be known at once [???] instead of
being secret for several days at least [???] as it might be . and what is more [???]
the bridge and the east road near the borders will certainly be watched [???]
whether any rider gets into buckland or not . we don ' t know how many there
are ; but there are at least two [???] and possibly more . the only thing to do is
to go off in a qu ite unexpected direction . '
' but that can only mean going into the old forest ! ' said [???]
[???] . ' you can ' t be thinking of doing that . it is quite as dangerous as
black riders . '
' not quite [???] ' said merry . it sounds very desperate [???] but i believe [???]
is right . it is the only way of getting off without being followed at once .
with luck we might gel a considerable start . '
' but you won ' t have any luck in the old forest [???] ' objected [???] . ' no
one ever has luck in there . you ' ll gel lost . people don ' t go in there . '
' oh yes they do ! ' said merry . ' the [???] go in - occasionally
when the fit takes them . we have a private entrance . [???] went in once [???]
long ago . i have been in several times : usually in daylight [???] of course [???] when
the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet . '
' well [???] do as you think best ! ' said [???] . ' i am more afraid of the
old forest than of anything i know about : the stories about it are a
[???] ; but my vote hardly counts [???] as i am not going on the journey .
still [???] i am very glad someone is stopping behind [???] who can tell [???] what
you have done [???] when he turns up [???] as i am sure he will before long . '
fond as he was of [???] [???] fatty bolger had no desire to leave the shire [???]
nor to see what lay outside it . his family came from the [???] [???] from
[???] in [???] in fact [???] but he had never been over the [???]

bridge . his task [???] according to the original plans of the conspirators [???] was
to stay behind and deal with [???] folk [???] and to keep up as long as
possible the pretence that mr . [???] was still living at [???] . he
had even brought along some old clothes of [???] ' s to help him in playing
the part . they little thought how dangerous that part might prove .
' excellent ! ' said [???] [???] when he understood the plan . ' we could not
have left any message behind for [???] otherwise . i don ' t know whether
these riders can read or not [???] of course [???] but i should not have dared to risk
a written message [???] in case they got in and searched the house . but if fatty
is willing to hold the fort [???] and i can be sure of [???] knowing the way we
have gone [???] that decides me . i am going into the old forest first thing
tomorrow . '
' well [???] that ' s that [???] ' said [???] . ' on the whole i would rather have our
job than fatty ' s - waiting here till black riders come . '
' you wait till you are well inside the forest [???] ' said [???] . ' you ' ll
wish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow . '
' it ' s no good [???] about it any more [???] ' said merry . ' we have still
got to tidy up and put the finishing touches to the packing [???] before we get
to bed . i shall call you all before the break of day . '
when at last he had got to bed [???] [???] could not sleep for some time .
his legs ached . he . was glad that he was riding in the morning . eventually
he fell into a vague dream [???] in which he seemed to be looking out of a high
window over a dark sea of tangled trees . down below among the roots there
was the sound of creatures [???] and snuffling . he felt sure they would
smell him out sooner or later .
then he heard a noise in the distance . at first he thought it was a
great wind coming over the leaves of the forest . then he knew that it was
not leaves [???] but the sound of the sea far - off ; a sound he had never heard in
waking life [???] though it had often troubled his dreams . suddenly he found he
was out in the open . there were no trees after all . he was on a dark heath [???]
and there was a strange salt smell in the air . looking up he saw before him
a tall white tower [???] standing alone on a high ridge . a great desire came over
him to climb the tower and see the sea . he started to struggle up the ridge
towards the tower : but suddenly a light came in the sky [???] and there was a
noise of thunder .



[???] h4 [???] chapter 6 . [???] [???] h4 [???] the old forest



[???] woke suddenly . it was still dark in the room . merry was standing
there with a candle in one hand [???] and banging on the door with the other .
' all right ! what is it ? ' said [???] [???] still shaken and [???] .
' what is it ! ' cried merry . ' it is time to get up . it is half past four
and very [???] . come on ! sam is already getting breakfast ready . even [???]
is up . i am just going to saddle the [???] [???] and fetch the one that is to be
the [???] - carrier . wake that [???] fatty ! at least he must get up and
see us off . '
soon after six o ' clock the five [???] were ready to start . fatty
bolger was still yawning . they stole quietly out of the house . merry went in
front leading a laden pony [???] and took his way along a path that went through
a spinney behind the house [???] and then cut across several fields . the leaves
of trees were [???] [???] and every twig was dripping ; the grass was grey
with cold dew . everything was still [???] and far - away noises seemed near and
clear : fowls chattering in a yard [???] someone closing a door of a distant
house .
in their shed they found the [???] ; [???] little beasts of the kind
loved by [???] [???] not speedy [???] but good for a long day ' s work . they mounted [???]
and soon they were riding off into the mist [???] which seemed to open
[???] before them and close [???] behind them . after riding for
about an hour [???] slowly and without talking [???] they saw the hedge looming
suddenly ahead . it was tall and netted over with silver cobwebs . ' how are
you going to get through this ? ' asked [???] . ' follow me ! ' said merry [???]
' and you will see . ' he turned to the left along the hedge [???] and soon they
came to a point wher e it bent inwards [???] running along the lip of a hollow . a
cutting had been made [???] at some distance from the hedge [???] and went [???]
gently down into the ground . it had walls of brick at the sides [???] which rose
steadily [???] until suddenly they arched over a nd formed a tunnel that dived
deep under the hedge and came out in the hollow on the other side .
here fatty bolger halted . ' good - bye [???] [???] ! ' he said . ' i wish you were
not going into the forest . i only hope you will not need [???] before the
day is out . but good luck to you - today and every day ! '
' if there are no worse things ahead than the old forest [???] i shall be
lucky [???] ' said [???] . ' tell [???] to hurry along the east road : we shall

soon be back on it and going as fast as we can . ' ' good - bye ! ' they cried [???] and
rode down the slope and disappeared from [???] ' s sight into the tunnel .
it was dark and damp . at the far end it was closed by a gate of
thick - set iron bars . merry got down and unlocked the gate [???] and when they had
all passed through he pushed it to again . it shut with a clang [???] and the lock
clicked . the sound was [???] .
' there ! ' said merry . ' you have left the shire [???] and are now outside [???] and
on the edge of the old forest . '
' are the stories about it true ? ' asked [???] .
' i don ' t know what stories you mean [???] ' merry answered . ' if you mean the
old [???] - stories fatty ' s nurses used to tell him [???] about [???] and wolves
and things of that sort [???] i should say no . at any rate i don ' t believe them .
but the forest is queer . everything in it is very much more alive [???] more
aware of what is going on [???] so to speak [???] than things are in the shire . and
the trees do not like strangers . they watch you . they are usually content
merely to watch you [???] as long a s daylight lasts [???] and don ' t do much .
occasionally the most [???] ones may drop a branch [???] or stick a root
out [???] or grasp at you with a long [???] . but at night things can be most
alarming [???] or so i am told . i have only once or twice been in here after
dark [???] and then only near the hedge . i thought all the trees were whispering
to each other [???] passing news and plots along in an [???] language ;
and the branches swayed and groped without any wind . they do say the trees
do actually move [???] and can surround strangers and hem them in . in fact long
ago they attacked the hedge : they came and planted themselves right by it [???]
and leaned over it . but the [???] came and cut down hundreds of trees [???] and
made a great [???] in the forest [???] and burned all the ground in a long
strip east of the hedge . after that the trees gave up the attack [???] but they
became very [???] . there is still a wide bare space not far inside
where the [???] was made . '
' is it only the trees that are dangerous ? ' asked [???] .
' there are various queer things living deep in the forest [???] and on the
far side [???] ' said merry [???] ' or at least i have heard so ; but i have never seen
any of them . but something makes paths . whenever one comes inside one
finds
open tracks ; but they seem to shift and change from time to time in a queer
fashion . not far from this tunnel there is [???] or was for a long time [???] the
beginning of quite a broad path leading to the [???] glade [???] and then on

more or less in our direction [???] east and a little north . that is the path i
am going to try and find . '
the [???] now left the tunnel - gate and rode across the wide hollow .
on the far side was a faint path leading up on to the floor of the forest [???] a
hundred yards a nd more beyond the hedge ; but it vanished as soon as it
brought them under the trees . looking back they could see the dark line of
the hedge through the stems of trees that were already thick about them .
looking ahead they could see only tree - trunks of [???] sizes and
shapes : straight or bent [???] twisted [???] leaning [???] squat or slender [???] smooth or
[???] and branched ; and all the stems were green or grey with moss and
[???] [???] [???] growths .
merry alone seemed fairly cheerful . ' you had better lead on and find
that path [???] ' [???] said to him . ' don ' t let us lose one another [???] or forget
which way the hedge lies ! '
they picked a way among the trees [???] and their [???] [???] along [???]
carefully avoiding the many [???] and [???] roots . there was no
[???] . the ground was rising steadily [???] and as they went forward it
seemed that the trees became taller [???] darker [???] and thicker . there was no
sound [???] except an occasional drip of moisture falling through the still
leaves . for the moment there was no whispering or movement among the
branches ; but they all got an uncomfortable feeling that they were being
watched with [???] [???] deepening to dislike and even enmity . the feeling
steadily grew [???] until they found themselves looking up quickly [???] or glancing
back over their shoulders [???] as if they expected a sudden blow .
there was not as yet any sign of a path [???] and the trees seemed
constantly to bar their way . [???] suddenly felt that he could not bear it
any longer [???] and without warning let out a shout . ' oi ! oi ! ' he cried . ' i am
not going to do anything . just let me pass through [???] will you ! '
the others halted startled ; but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy
curtain . there was no echo or answer though the wood seemed to become
more
crowded and more watchful than before .
' i should not shout [???] if i were you [???] ' said merry . it does more harm than
good . '
[???] began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through [???] a nd if
he had been right to make the others come into this abominable wood . merry
was looking from side to side [???] and seemed already uncertain which way to go .

[???] noticed it . ' it has not taken you long to lose us [???] ' he said . but at
that moment merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead .
' well [???] well ! ' he said . ' these trees do shift . there is the [???]
glade in front of us ( or i hope so ) [???] but the path to it seems to have moved
away ! '
the light grew clearer as they went forward . suddenly they came out of
the trees and found themselves in a wide circular space . there was sky above
them [???] blue and clear to their surprise [???] for down under the forest - roof they
had not been able to see the rising morning and the lifting of the mist . the
sun was not [???] however [???] high enough yet to shine down into the clearing [???]
though its light was on the tree - tops . the leaves were all thicker and
greener about the edges of the glade [???] enclosing it with an almost solid
wall . no tree grew there [???] only rough grass and many tall plants : stalky and
faded [???] and wood - parsley [???] fire - weed seeding into [???] ashes [???] and
rampant nettles and thistles . a dreary place : but it seemed a charming and
cheerful garden after the close forest .
the [???] felt encouraged [???] and looked up hopefully at the broadening
daylight in the sky . at the far side of the glade there was a break in the
wall of trees [???] and a clear path beyond it . they could see it running on into
the wood [???] wide in places and open above [???] though every now and again the
trees drew in and [???] it with their dark boughs . up this path they
rode . they were still climbing gently [???] but they now went much quicker [???] and
with better heart ; for it seemed to them that the forest had relented [???] and
was going to let them pass [???] after all .
but after a while the air began to get hot and stuffy . the trees drew
close again on either side [???] and they could no longer see far ahead . now
stronger than ever they felt again the ill will of the wood pressing on
them . so silent was it that the fall of their [???] ' [???] [???] rustling on
dead leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden roots [???] seemed to thud in
their ears . [???] tried to sing a song to encourage them [???] but his voice sank
to a murmur .
o ! wanderers in the shadowed land
despair not ! for though dark they stand [???]
all woods there be must end at last [???]
and see the open sun go past :
the setting sun [???] the rising sun [???]
the day ' s end [???] or the day begun .

for east or west all woods must fail . . .
fail - even as he said the word his voice faded into silence . the air
seemed heavy and the making of words [???] . just behind them a large
branch fell from an old [???] tree with a crash into the path . the
trees seemed to close in before them .
' they do not like all that about ending and failing [???] ' said merry . ' i
should not sing any more at present . wait till we do get to the edge [???] and
then we ' ll turn and give them a rousing chorus ! '
he spoke cheerfully [???] and if he felt any great anxiety [???] he did not show
it . the others did not answer . they were depressed . a heavy weight was
settling steadily on [???] ' s heart [???] and he [???] now with every step
forward that he had ever thought of challenging the menace of the trees . he
was [???] indeed [???] just about to stop and propose going back ( if that was still
possible ) [???] when things took a new turn . the path stopped climbing [???] and
became for a while nearly level . the dark trees drew aside [???] and ahead they
could see the path going almost straight forward . before them [???] but some
distance off [???] there stood a green hill - top [???] treeless [???] rising like a bald
head out of the [???] wood . the path seemed to be making directly for
it .
they now hurried forward again [???] delighted with the thought of climbing
out for a while above the roof of the forest . the path dipped [???] and then
again began to climb upwards [???] leading them at last to the foot of the steep
hillside . there it left the trees and faded into the turf . the wood stood
all round the hill like thick hair that ended sharply in a circle round a
shaven crown .
the [???] led their [???] up [???] winding round and round until they
reached the top . there they stood and gazed about them . the air was gleaming
and [???] [???] but hazy ; and they could not see to any great distance . near at
hand the mist was now almost gone ; though here and there it lay in hollows
of the wood [???] and to the south of them [???] out of a deep fold cutting right
across the forest [???] the fog still rose like steam or wisps of white smoke .
' that [???] ' said merry [???] pointing with his hand [???] ' that is the line of the
[???] . it comes down out of the downs and flows south - west through
the
midst of the forest to join the [???] below [???] . we don ' t want to
go that way ! the [???] valley is said to be the [???] part of the
whole wood - the centre from which all the [???] comes [???] as it were . '

the others looked in the direction that merry pointed out [???] but they
could see little but mists over the damp and deep - cut valley ; and beyond it
the southern half of the forest faded from view .
the sun on the hill - lop was now getting hot . it must have been a bout
eleven o ' clock ; but the autumn haze still prevented them from seeing much in
other directions . in the west they could not make out either the line of the
hedge or the valley of the [???] beyond it . northward [???] where they
looked most hopefully [???] they could see nothing that might be the line of the
great east road [???] for which they were making . they were on an island in a sea
of trees [???] and the [???] was veiled .
on the south - eastern side the ground fell very steeply [???] as if the
[???] of the hill were continued far down under the trees [???] like
island - shores that really are the sides of a mountain rising out of deep
waters . they sat on the green edge and looked out over the woods below them [???]
while they ate their mid - day meal . as the sun rose and passed noon they
[???] far off in the east the grey - green lines of the downs that lay
beyond the old forest on that side . that cheered them greatly ; for it was
good to see a sight of anything beyond the wood ' s border s [???] though they did
not mean to go that way [???] if they could help it : the barrow - downs had as
sinister a reputation in hobbit - legend as the forest itself .
at length they made up their minds to go on again . the path that had
brought them to the hill reappeared on the northward side ; but they had not
followed it far before they became aware that it was bending steadily to the
right . soon it began to descend rapidly and they guessed that it must
actually be heading towards the [???] va lley : not at all the direction
they wished lo take . after some discussion they decided to leave this
[???] path and strike northward ; for although they had not been able to
see it from the hill - top [???] the road must lie that way [???] and it could not be
many miles off . also northward [???] and to the left of the path [???] the land seemed
lo be drier and more open [???] climbing up to [???] where the trees were
thinner [???] and pines and firs replaced the oaks and ashes and other strange
and nameless trees of the denser wood .
at first their choice seemed to be good : they got along at a fair
speed [???] though whenever they got a glimpse of the sun in an open glade they
seemed [???] to have veered eastwards . but after a time the trees
began to close in again [???] just where they had appeared from a distance to be
thinner and less tangled . then deep folds in the ground were discovered

[???] [???] like the ruts of great giant - wheels or wide moats and sunken
roads long disused and choked with [???] . these lay usually right across
their line of march [???] and could only be crossed by [???] down and out
again [???] which was troublesome and difficult with their [???] . each time they
climbed down they found the hollow filled with thick bushes and matted
[???] [???] which somehow would not yield to the left [???] but only gave way
when they turned to the right ; and they had to go some distance along the
bottom before they could find a way up the further bank . each time they
[???] out [???] the trees seemed deeper and darker ; and always to the left
and upwards it was most difficult to find a way [???] and they were forced to the
right and downwards .
after an hour or two they had lost all clear sense of direction [???] though
they knew well enough that they had long ceased to go northward at all . they
were being headed off [???] and were simply following a course chosen for them -
eastwards and southwards [???] into the heart of the forest and not out of it .
the afternoon was wearing away when they [???] and [???] into a
fold that was wider and deeper than any they had yet met . it was so sleep
and [???] that it proved impossible to climb out of it again [???] either
forwards or backwards [???] without leaving their [???] and their [???]
behind . all they could do was to follow the fold - downwards . the ground
grew soft [???] and in places [???] ; springs appeared in the banks [???] and soon they
found themselves following a brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy
bed . then the ground began to fall rapidly [???] and the brook growing strong and
noisy [???] flowed and leaped swiftly [???] . they were in a deep dim - lit gully
over - arched by trees high above them .
after stumbling along for some way along the stream [???] they came quite
suddenly out of the gloom . as if through a gate they saw the sunlight before
them . coming to the opening they found that they had made their way down
through a cleft in a high sleep bank [???] almost a cliff . at its feet was a wide
space of grass and reeds ; and in the distance could be [???] another bank
almost as steep . a golden afternoon of late sunshine lay warm and drowsy
upon the hidden land between . in the midst of it there wound [???] a dark
river of brown water [???] bordered with ancient willows [???] arched over with
willows [???] blocked with fallen willows [???] and flecked with thousands of faded
willow - leaves . the air was thick with them [???] [???] yellow from the
branches ; for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing softly in the
valley [???] and the reeds were rustling [???] and the willow - boughs were creaking .

' well [???] now i have at least some notion of where we are ! ' said merry .
' we have come almost in the opposite direction to which we intended . this is
the river [???] ! i will go on and explore . '
he passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long grasses .
after a while he reappeared [???] and reported that there was fairly solid ground
between the cliff - foot and the river ; in some places firm turf went down to
the water ' s edge . ' what ' s more [???] ' he said [???] ' there seems to be something like
a [???] winding along on this side of the river . if we turn left and
follow it [???] we shall be bound to come out on the east side of the forest
eventually . '
' i dare say ! ' said [???] . ' that is [???] if the track goes on so far [???] and
does not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there . who made the track [???]
do you suppose [???] and why ? i am sure it was not for our benefit . i am getting
very suspicious of this forest and everything in it [???] and i begin to believe
all the stories about it . and have you any idea how far eastward we should
have to go ? '
' no [???] ' said merry [???] ' i haven ' t . i don ' t know in the least how far down
the [???] we are [???] or who could possibly come here often enough to
make
a path along it . but there is no other way out that i can see or think of . '
there being nothing else for it [???] they filed out [???] and merry led them to
the path that he had discovered . everywhere the reeds and grasses were lush
and tall [???] in places far above their heads ; but once found [???] the path was easy
to follow [???] as it turned and twisted [???] picking out the sounder ground among
the bogs and [???] . here and there it passed over other [???] [???] running down
gullies into the wi [???] out of the higher forest - lands [???] and at these
points there were tree - trunks or bundles of [???] laid carefully across .
the [???] began to feel very hot . there were armies of flies of all
kinds buzzing round their ears [???] and the afternoon sun was burning on their
backs . at last they came suddenly into a thin shade ; great grey branches
reached across the path . each step forward became more [???] than the
last . sleepiness seemed to be creeping out of the ground and up their legs [???]
and falling softly out of the air upon their heads and eyes .
[???] felt his chin go down and his head nod . just in front of him
[???] fell forward on to his knees . [???] halted . ' it ' s no good [???] ' he heard
merry saying . ' can ' t go another step without rest . must have nap . it ' s cool
under the willows . less flies ! '

[???] did not like the sound of this . ' come on ! ' he cried . ' we can ' t
have a nap yet . we must get clear of the forest first . ' but the others were
too far gone to care . besi de them sam stood yawning and blinking stupidly .
suddenly [???] himself felt sleep overwhelming him . his head swam .
there now seemed hardly a sound in the air . the flies had stopped buzzing .
only a gentle noise on the edge of hearing [???] a soft [???] as of a song
half whispered [???] seemed to stir in the boughs above . he lifted his heavy eyes
and saw leaning over him a huge willow - tree [???] old and hoary . enormous it
looked [???] its [???] branches going up like reaching arms with many
long - fingered hands [???] its knotted and twisted trunk gaping in wide [???]
that creaked faintly as the boughs moved . the leaves [???] against the
bright sky dazzled him [???] and he toppled over [???] lying where he fell upon the
grass .
merry and [???] dragged themselves forward and lay down with their
backs to the willow - trunk . behind them the great cracks gaped wide to
receive them as the tree swayed and creaked . they looked up at the grey and
yellow leaves [???] moving softly against the light [???] and singing . they shut their
eyes [???] and then it seemed that they could almost hear words [???] cool words [???]
saying something about water and sleep . they gave themselves up to the spell
and fell fast asleep at the foot of the great grey willow .
[???] lay for a while fighting with the sleep that was [???]
him ; then with an effort he struggled to his feel again . he felt a
compelling desire for cool water . ' wait for me [???] sam [???] ' he [???] . ' must
bathe feet a minute . '
half in a dream he wandered forward to the riverward side of the tree [???]
where great winding roots grew out into the stream [???] like [???] dragonets
straining down to drink . he [???] one of these [???] and [???] his hot feel
in the cool brown water ; and there he too suddenly fell asleep with his back
against the tree .
sam sat down and scratched his head [???] and yawned like a cavern . he was
worried . the afternoon was getting late [???] and he thought this sudden
sleepiness uncanny . ' there ' s more behind this than sun and warm air [???] ' he
muttered to himself . ' i don ' t like this great big tree . i don ' t trust it .
hark at it singing about sleep now ! this won ' t do at all ! '
he pulled himself to his feet [???] and [???] off to see what had become
of the [???] . he found that two had wandered on a good way along the path ;
and he had just caught them and brought them back towards the others [???] when

he heard two noises ; one loud [???] and the other soft but very clear . one was
the splash of something heavy falling into the water ; the other was a noise
like the snick of a lock when a door quietly closes fast .
he rushed back to the bank . [???] was in the water close to the edge [???]
and a great tree - root seemed to be over him and holding him down [???] but he was
not struggling . sam gripped him by the jacket [???] and dragged him from under
the root ; and then with difficulty hauled him on to the bank . almost at once
he woke [???] and coughed and [???] .
' do you know [???] sam [???] ' he said at length [???] ' the beastly tree threw me in ! i
felt it . the big root just twisted round and tipped me in ! '
' you were dreaming i expect [???] mr . [???] [???] ' said sam . ' you shouldn ' t sit
in such a place [???] if you feel sleepy . '
' what about the others ? ' [???] asked . ' i wonder what sort of dr eams
they are having . '
they went round to the other side of the tree [???] and then sam understood
the click that he had heard . [???] had vanished . the crack by which he had
laid himself had closed together [???] so that not a chink could be seen . merry
was trapped : another crack had closed about his waist ; his legs lay outside [???]
but the rest of him was inside a dark opening [???] the edges of which gripped
like a pair of [???] .
[???] and sam beat first upon the tree - trunk where [???] had lain .
they then struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of the crack that held
poor merry . it was quite useless .
' what a foul thing to happen ! ' cried [???] wildly . ' why did we ever
come into this dreadful forest ? i wish we were all back at [???] ! ' he
kicked the tree with all his strength [???] heedless of his own feet . a hardly
[???] shiver ran through the stem and up into the branches ; the leaves
rustled and whispered [???] but with a sound now of faint and far - off laughter .
' i suppose we haven ' t got an axe among our [???] [???] mr . [???] ? ' asked
sam .
' i brought a little hatchet for chopping [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' that
wouldn ' t be much use . '
' wait a minute ! ' cried sam [???] struck by an idea suggested by [???] .
' we might do something with fire ! '
' we might [???] ' said [???] doubtfully . ' we might succeed in roasting [???]
alive inside . '



' we might try to hurt or frighten this tree to begin with [???] ' said sam
fiercely . ' if it don ' t let them go [???] i ' ll have it down [???] if i have to gnaw
it . ' he ran to the [???] and before long came back with two tinder - boxes
and a hatchet .
quickly they gathered dry grass and leaves [???] and bits of bark ; and made
a pile of broken twigs and chopped sticks . these they heaped against the
trunk on the far side of the tree from the prisoners . as soon as sam had
struck a spark into the tinder [???] it kindled the dry grass and a [???] of
flame and smoke went up . the twigs crackled . little fingers of fire licked
against the dry scored rind of the ancient tree and [???] it . a tremor
ran through the whole willow . the leaves seemed to hiss above their heads
with a sound of pain and anger . a loud scream came from merry [???] and from far
inside the tree they heard [???] give a muffled yell .
' put it out ! put it out ! ' cried merry . ' he ' ll [???] me in two [???] if you
don ' t . he says so ! '
' who ? what ? ' shouted [???] [???] rushing round to the other side of the
tree .
' put it out ! put it out ! ' begged merry . the branches of the wi llow
began to sway violently . there was a sound as of a wind rising and spreading
outwards to the branches of all the other trees round about [???] as though they
had dropped a stone into the quiet slumber of the river - valley and set up
ripples of anger that ran out over the whole forest . sam kicked at the
little fire and stamped out the sparks . but [???] [???] without any clear idea of
why he did so [???] or what he hoped for [???] ran along the path crying help ! help !
help ! it seemed to him that he could hardly hear the sound of his own shrill
voice : it was blown away from him by the willow - wind and drowned in a
clamour of leaves [???] as soon as the words left his mouth . he felt desperate :
lost and witless .
suddenly he [???] . there was an answer [???] or so he thought ; but it
seemed to come from behind him [???] away down the path further back in the
forest . he turned round and listened [???] and soon there could be no doubt :
someone was singing a song ; a deep glad voice was singing carelessly and
happily [???] but it was singing nonsense :
hey dol ! merry dol ! ring a dong dillo !
ring a dong ! hop along ! fal lal the willow !
tom bom [???] jolly tom [???] tom [???] !

half hopeful and half afraid of some new danger [???] [???] and sam now both
stood still . suddenly out of a long string of nonsense - words ( or so they
seemed ) the voice rose up loud and clear and burst into this song :
hey ! come merry dot ! derry dol ! my darling !
light goes the weather - wind and the feathered starling .
down along under hill [???] shining in the sunlight [???]
waiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight [???]
there my pretty lady is . river - woman ' s daughter [???]
slender as the willow - wand [???] clearer than the water .
old tom [???] water - lilies bringing
comes hopping home again . can you hear him singing ?
hey ! come merry dol ! deny dol ! and merry - o [???]
goldberry [???] goldberry [???] merry yellow berry - o !
poor old willow - man [???] you tuck your roots away !
tom ' s in a hurry now . evening will follow day .
tom ' s going home again water - lilies bringing .
hey ! come derry dol ! can you hear me singing ?
[???] and sam stood as if enchanted . the wind puffed out . the leaves
hung silently again on stiff branches . there was another burst of song [???] and
then suddenly [???] hopping and dancing along the path [???] there appeared above the
reeds an old battered hat with a tall crown and a long blue feather stuck in
the band . with another hop and a bound there came into view a man [???] or so it
seemed . at any rate he wa s too large and heavy for a hobbit [???] if not quite
tall enough for one of the big people [???] though he made noise enough for one [???]
[???] along with great yellow boots on his thick legs [???] and charging
through grass and rushes like a cow going down to drink . he had a blue coat
and a long brown beard ; his eyes were blue and bright [???] and his face was red
as a ripe apple [???] but creased into a hundred wrinkles of laughter . in his
hands he carried on a large leaf as on a tray a small pile of white
water - lilies .
' help ! ' cried [???] and sam running towards him with their hands
stretched out .
' whoa ! whoa ! steady there ! ' cried the old man [???] holding up one hand [???] and
they stopped short [???] as if they had been struck stiff . ' now [???] my little
fellows [???] where be you a - going to [???] puffing like a bellows ? what ' s the matter
here then ? do you know who i am ? i ' m tom [???] . tell me what ' s
your

trouble ! tom ' s in a hurry now . don ' t you crush my lilies ! '
' my friends are caught in the willow - tree [???] ' cried [???] breathlessly .
' master merry ' s being [???] in a crack ! ' cried sam .
' what ? ' shouted tom [???] [???] leaping up in the air . ' old man willow ?
naught worse than that [???] eh ? that can soon be mended . i know the tune for
him . old grey willow - man ! i ' ll freeze his marrow cold [???] if he don ' t behave
himself . i ' ll sing his roots off . i ' ll sing a wind up and blow leaf and
branch away . old man willow ! ' setting down his lilies carefully on the
grass [???] he ran to the tree . there he saw merry ' s feet still sticking out -
the rest had already been drawn further inside . tom put his mouth to the
crack and began singing into it in a low voice . they could not catch the
words [???] but evidently merry was [???] . his legs began to kick . tom sprang
away [???] and breaking off a hanging branch smote the side of the willow with
it . ' you let them out again [???] old man willow ! ' he said . ' what be you
a - thinking of ? you should not be waking . eat earth ! dig deep ! drink water !
go to sleep ! [???] is talking ! ' he then seized merry ' s feet and drew him
out of the suddenly widening crack .
there was a tearing creak and the other crack split open [???] and out of it
[???] sprang [???] as if he had been kicked . then with a loud snap both cracks
closed fast again . a shudder ran through the tree from root to tip [???] and
complete silence fell .
' thank you ! ' said the [???] [???] one after the other .
tom [???] burst out laughing . ' well [???] my little fellows ! ' said he [???]
stooping so that he peered into their faces . ' you shall come home with me !
the table is all laden with yellow cream [???] [???] [???] and white bread and
butter . goldberry is waiting . time enough for questions around the supper
table . you follow after me as quick as you are able ! ' with that he picked up
his lilies [???] and then with a [???] wave of his hand went hopping and
dancing along the path eastward [???] still singing loudly and [???] .
too surprised and too relieved to talk [???] the [???] followed a fter him
as fast as they could . but that was not fast enough . tom soon disappeared in
front of them [???] and the noise of his singing got fainter and further away .
suddenly his voice came floating back to them in a loud halloo !
hop along [???] my little friends [???] up the [???] !
tom ' s going on ahead candles for to kindle .
down west sinks the sun : soon you will be groping .
when the night - shadows fall [???] then the door will open [???]

out of the window - panes light will [???] yellow .
fear no alder black ! heed no hoary willow !
fear neither root nor bough ! tom goes on before you .
hey now ! merry dot ! we ' ll be waiting for you !
after that the [???] heard no more . almost at once the sun seemed to
sink into the trees behind them . they thought of the [???] light of
evening glittering on the [???] river [???] and the windows of [???]
beginning to gleam with hundreds of lights . great shadows fell across them ;
trunks and branches of trees hung dark and threatening over the path . white
mists began to rise and curl on the surface of the river and stray about the
roots of the trees upon its borders . out of the very ground at their feet a
shadowy steam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling [???] .
it became difficult to follow the path [???] and they were very tired . their
legs seemed leaden . strange [???] noises ran among the bushes and reeds on
either side of them ; and if they looked up to the pale sky [???] they caught
sight of queer [???] and [???] faces that gloomed dark against the
[???] [???] and leered down at them from the high bank and the edges of the
wood . they began to feel that all this country was unreal [???] and that they
were stumbling through an [???] dream that led to no awakening .
just as they felt their feet slowing down to a [???] [???] they noticed
that the ground was gently rising . the water began to murmur . in the
darkness they caught the white glimmer of foam [???] where the river flowed over
a short fall . then suddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were left
behind . they stepped out from the forest [???] and found a wide sweep of grass
welling up before them . the river [???] now small and swift [???] was leaping merrily
down to meet them [???] [???] here and there in the light of the stars [???] which
were already shining in the sky .
the grass under their feet was smooth and short [???] as if it had been mown
or shaven . the eaves of the forest behind were clipped [???] and trim as a hedge .
the path was now plain before them [???] well - tended and bordered with stone . it
wound up on to the top of a grassy knoll [???] now grey under the pale starry
night ; and there [???] still high above them on a further slope [???] they saw the
[???] lights of a house . down again the path went [???] and then up aga in [???] up
a long smooth hillside of turf [???] towards the light . suddenly a wide yellow
beam flowed out brightly from a door that was opened . there was tom
[???] ' s house before them [???] up [???] down [???] under hill . behind it a steep
shoulder of the land lay grey and bare [???] and beyond that the dark shapes of

the barrow - downs stalked away into the eastern night .
they all hurried forward [???] [???] and [???] . already half their
weariness and all their fears had fallen from them . hey ! come merry dol !
rolled out the song to greet them .
hey ! come derry dol ! hop along [???] my hearties !
[???] ! [???] all ! we are fond of parties .
now let the fun begin ! let us sing together !
then another clear voice [???] as young and as ancient as spring [???] like the
song of a glad water flowing down into the night from a bright morning in
the hills [???] came falling like silver to meet them :
now let the song begin ! let us sing together
of sun [???] stars [???] moon and mist [???] rain and cloudy weather [???]
light on the budding leaf [???] dew on the feather [???]
wind on the open hill [???] bells on the heather [???]
reeds by the shady pool [???] lilies on the water :
old tom [???] and the river - daughter !
and with that song the [???] stood upon the [???] [???] and a golden
light was all about them .




chapter 7 . in the house of tom [???]



the four [???] stepped over the wide stone [???] [???] and stood
still [???] blinking . they were in a long low room [???] filled with the light of
lamps swinging from the beams of the roof ; and on the table of dark polished
wood stood many candles [???] tall and yellow [???] burning brightly .
in a chair [???] at the far side of the room facing the outer door [???] sat a
woman . her long yellow hair rippled down her shoulders ; her gown was
green [???]
green as young reeds [???] shot with silver like beads of dew ; and her belt was
of gold [???] shaped like a chain of flag - lilies set with the pale - blue eyes of
forget - me - nots . about her feel in wide vessels of green and brown
[???] [???] white water - lilies were floating [???] so that she seemed to be
[???] in the midst of a pool .
' enter [???] good guests ! ' she said [???] and as she spoke they knew that it was
her clear voice they had heard singing . they came a few timid steps further
into the room [???] and began to bow low [???] feeling strangely surprised and
[???] [???] like folk that [???] knocking at a cottage door to beg for a drink of
water [???] have been answered by a fair young elf - queen clad in living flowers .
but before they could say anything [???] she sprang lightly up and over the
lily - bowls [???] and ran laughing towards them ; and as she ran her gown rustled
softly like the wind in the flowering borders of a river .
' come dear folk ! ' she said [???] taking [???] by the hand . ' laugh and be
merry ! i am goldberry [???] daughter of the river . ' then lightly she passed them
and closing the door she turned her back to it [???] with her white arms spread
out across it . ' let us shut out the night ! ' she said . ' for you are still
afraid [???] per haps [???] of mist and tree - shadows and deep water [???] and untame things .
fear nothing ! for tonight you are under the roof of tom [???] . '
the [???] looked at her in wonder ; and she looked at each of them and
smiled . ' fair lady goldberry ! ' said [???] at last [???] feeling his heart moved
with a joy that he did not understand . he stood as he had at times stood
enchanted by fair elven - voices ; but the spell that was now laid upon him was
different : less keen and lofty was the delight [???] but deeper and nearer to
mortal heart ; marvellous and yet not strange . ' fair lady goldberry ! ' he said
again . ' now the joy that was hidden in the songs we heard is made plain to

me .
o slender as a willow - wand ! o clearer than clear water !
o reed by the living pool ! fair river - daughter !
o spring - time and summer - time [???] and spring again after !
o wind on the waterfall [???] and the leaves ' laughter ! '
suddenly he stopped and [???] [???] overcome with surprise to hear
himself saying such things . but goldberry laughed .
' welcome ! ' she said . ' i had not heard that folk of the shire were so
sweet - tongued . but i see you are an elf - friend ; the light in your eyes and
the ring in your voice tells it . this is a merry meeting ! sit now [???] and wait
for the master of the house ! he will not be long . he is tending your tired
beasts . '
the [???] sat down gladly in low rush - seated chairs [???] while goldberry
busied herself about the table ; and their eyes followed her [???] for the slender
grace of her movement filled them with quiet delight . from somewhere behind
the house came the sound of singing . every now and again they caught [???] among
many a derry dol and a merry dol and a ring a ding dillo the repeated words :
old tom [???] is a merry fellow ;
bright blue his jacket is [???] and his boots are yellow .
' fair lady ! ' said [???] again after a while . ' tell me [???] if my asking
does not seem foolish [???] who is tom [???] ? '
' he is [???] ' said goldberry [???] staying her swift movements and smiling .
[???] looked a t her questioningly . ' he is [???] as you have seen him [???] ' she
said in answer to his look . ' he is the master of wood [???] water [???] and hill . '
' then all this strange land belongs to him ? '
' no indeed ! ' she answered [???] and her smile faded . ' that would indeed be a
burden [???] ' she added in a low voice [???] as if to herself . ' the trees and the
grasses and all things growing or living in the land belong each to
themselves . tom [???] is the master . no one has ever caught old tom
walking in the forest [???] wading in the water [???] leaping on the hill - tops under
light and shadow . he has no fear . tom [???] is master . '
a door opened and in came tom [???] . he had now no hat and his
thick
brown hair was crowned with autumn leaves . he laughed [???] and going to
goldberry [???] took her hand .
' here ' s my pretty lady ! ' he said [???] bowing to the [???] . ' here ' s my
goldberry clothed all in silver - green with flowers in her girdle ! is the

table laden ? i see yellow cream and [???] [???] and white bread [???] and butter ;
milk [???] cheese [???] and green herbs and ripe berries gathered . is that enough for
us ? is the supper ready ? '
' it is [???] ' said goldberry ; ' but the guests perhaps are not ? '
tom clapped his hands and cried : ' tom [???] tom ! your guests are tired [???] and
you had near forgotten ! come now [???] my merry friends [???] and tom will refresh
you ! you shall clean grimy hands [???] and wash your weary faces ; cast off your
muddy cloaks and comb out your [???] ! '
he opened the door [???] and they followed him down a short passage and
round a sharp turn . they came to a low room with a [???] roof ( a
penthouse [???] it seemed [???] built on to the north end of the house ) . its walls
were of clean stone [???] but they were mostly covered with green hanging mats
and yellow curtains . the floor was flagged [???] and strewn with fresh green
rushes . there were four deep [???] [???] each piled with white blankets [???]
laid on the floor along one side . against the opposite wall was a long bench
laden with wide [???] basins [???] and beside it stood brown ewers filled
with water [???] some cold [???] some steaming hot . there were soft green slippers set
ready beside each bed .
before long [???] washed and refreshed [???] the [???] were seated at the
table [???] two on each side [???] while at e ither end sat goldberry and the master .
it was a long and merry meal . though the [???] ate [???] as only famished
[???] can eat [???] there was no lack . the drink in their drinking - bowls seemed
to be clear cold water [???] yet it went to their hearts like wi ne and set free
their voices . the guests became suddenly aware that they were singing
merrily [???] as if it was easier and more natural than talking .
at last tom and goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftly . the
guests were commanded to sit quiet [???] and were set in chairs [???] each with a
[???] to his tired feet . there was a fire in the wide hearth before
them [???] and it was burning with a sweet smell [???] as if it were built of
apple - wood . when everything was set in order [???] a ll the lights in the room
were put out [???] except one lamp and a pair of candles at each end of the
chimney - shelf . then goldberry came and stood before them [???] holding a candle ;
and she wished them each a good night and deep sleep .
' have peace now [???] ' she said [???] ' until the morning ! heed no nightly noises !
for nothing passes door and window here save moonlight and starlight and the
wind off the hill - top . good night ! ' she passed out of the room with a
glimmer and a rustle . the sound of her [???] was like a stream falling

gently away [???] over cool stones in the quiet of night .
tom sat on a while beside them in silence [???] while each of them tried to
muster the courage to ask one of the many questions he had meant to ask at
supper . sleep gathered on their eyelids . at last [???] spoke :
' did you hear me calling [???] master [???] or was it just chance that brought
you at that moment ? '
tom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream . ' eh [???] what ? ' said
he . ' did i hear you calling ? nay [???] i did not hear : i was busy singing . just
chance brought me then [???] if chance you call it . it was no plan of mine [???]
though i was waiting for you . we heard news of you [???] and learned that you
were wandering . we guessed you ' d come ere long down to the water : all paths
lead that way [???] down to [???] . old grey willow - man [???] he ' s a mighty
singer ; and it ' s hard for little folk to escape his cunning [???] . but tom
had an errand there [???] that he dared not hinder . ' tom nodded as if sleep was
taking him again ; but he went on in a soft singing voice :
i had an errand there : gathering water - lilies [???]
green leaves and lilies white to please my pretty lady [???]
the last ere the year ' s end to keep them from the winter [???]
to flower by her pretty feet tilt the snows are melted .
each year at summer ' s end i go to find them for her [???]
in a wide pool [???] deep and clear [???] far down [???] ;
there they open first in spring and there they linger latest .
by that pool long ago i found the river - daughter [???]
fair young goldberry sitting in the rushes .
sweet was her singing then [???] and her heart was beating !
he opened his eyes and looked at them with a sudden glint of blue :
and that proved well for you - - for now i shall no longer
go down deep again along the forest - water [???]
not while the year is old . nor shall i be passing
old man willow ' s house this side of spring - time [???]
not till the merry spring [???] when the river - daughter
dances down the withy - path to bathe in the water .
he fell silent again ; but [???] could not help asking one more
question : the one he most desired to have answered . ' tell us [???] master [???] ' he
said [???] ' about the willow - man . what is he ? i have never heard of him before . '
' no [???] don ' t ! ' said merry and [???] together [???] sitting suddenly upright .
' not now ! not until the morning ! '

' that is right ! ' said the old man . ' now is the time for resting . some
things are ill to hear when the world ' s in shadow . sleep till the
morning - light [???] rest on the pillow ! heed no nightly noise ! fear no grey
willow ! ' and with that he took down the lamp and blew it out [???] and grasping a
candle in either hand he led them out of the room .
their [???] and pillows were soft as down [???] and the blankets were
of white wool . they had hardly laid themselves on the deep beds and drawn
the light covers over them before they were asleep .
in the dead night [???] [???] lay in a dream without light . then he saw the
young moon rising ; under its thin light there loomed before him a black wall
of rock [???] pierced by a dark arch like a great gate . it seemed to [???] that
he was lifted up [???] and passing over he saw that the rock - wall was a circle of
hills [???] and that within it was a plain [???] and in the midst of the plain stood a
[???] of stone [???] like a vast tower but not made by hands . on its top stood
the figure of a man . the moon as it rose seemed to hang for a moment above
his head and [???] in his white hair as the wind stirred it . up from the
dark plain below came the crying of fell voices [???] and the howling of many
wolves . suddenly a shadow [???] like the shape of great wings [???] passed across the
moon . the figure lifted his arms and a light flashed from the staff that he
[???] . a mighty ea gle swept down and bore him away . the voices wailed
and
the wolves [???] . there was a noise like a strong wind blowing [???] and on it
was borne the sound of [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] from the east .
' black riders ! ' thought [???] as he wakened [???] with the sound of the [???]
still echoing in his mind . he wondered if he would ever again have the
courage to leave the safety of these stone walls . he lay motionless [???] still
listening ; but all was now silent [???] and at last he turned and fell asleep
again or wandered into some other [???] dream .
at his side [???] lay dreaming pleasantly ; but a change came over his
dreams and he turned and groaned . suddenly he woke [???] or thought he had
waked [???]
and yet still heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed his dream :
tip - tap [???] squeak : the noise was like branches fretting in the wind [???]
twig - fingers scraping wall and window : creak [???] creak [???] creak . he wondered if
there were willow - trees close to the house ; and then suddenly he had a
dreadful feeling that he was not in an ordinary house at all [???] but inside the
willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him

again . he sat up [???] and felt the soft pillows yield to his hands [???] and he lay
down again relieved . he seemed to hear the echo of words in his ears : ' fear
nothing ! have peace until the morning ! heed no nightly noises ! ' then he went
to sleep again .
it was the sound of water that merry heard falling into his quiet
sleep : water streaming down gently [???] and then spreading [???] spreading
[???] all round the house into a dark shoreless pool . it [???]
under the walls [???] and was rising slowly but surely . ' i shall be drowned ! ' he
thought . it will find its way in [???] and then i shall drown . ' he felt that he
was lying in a soft [???] bog [???] and springing up he set his fool on the
corner of a cold hard flagstone . then he remembered where he was and lay
down again . he seemed to hear or remember hearing : ' nothing passes doors or
windows save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill - top . ' a
little breath of sweet air moved the curtain . he breathed deep and fell
asleep again .
as far as he could remember [???] sam slept through the night in deep
content [???] if logs are contented .
they woke up [???] all four at once [???] in the morning light . tom was moving
about the room whistling like a starling . when he heard them stir he clapped
his hands [???] and cried : ' hey ! come merry dol ! derry dol ! my hearties ! ' he drew
back the yellow curtains [???] and the [???] saw that these had covered the
windows [???] at either end of the room [???] one looking east and the other looking
west .
they leapt up refreshed . [???] ran to the eastern window [???] and found
himself looking into a kitchen - garden grey with dew . he had half expected to
see turf right up to the walls [???] turf all pocked with hoof - prints . actually
his view was screened by a tall line of beans on poles ; but above and far
beyond them the grey top of the hill loomed up against the [???] . it was a
pale morning : in the east [???] behind long clouds like lines of soiled wool
stained red at the edges [???] lay [???] deeps of yellow . the sky spoke of
rain to come ; but the light was broadening quickly [???] and the red flowers on
the beans began to glow against the wet green leaves .
[???] looked out of the western window [???] down into a pool of mist . the
forest was hidden under a fog . it was like looking down on to a [???]
cloud - roof from above . there was a fold or channel where the mist was broken
into many plumes and billows ; the valley of the [???] . the stream ran
down the hill on the left and vanished into the white shadows . near at hand

was a flower - garden and a clipped hedge silver - netted [???] and beyond that grey
shaven grass pale with dew - drops . there was no willow - tree to be seen .
' good morning [???] merry friends ! ' cried tom [???] opening the eastern window
wide . a cool air flowed in ; it had a rainy smell . ' sun won ' t show her face
much today . i ' m thinking . i have been walking wide [???] leaping on the [???] [???]
since the grey dawn began [???] nosing wind and weather [???] wet grass underfoot [???] wet
sky above me . i wakened goldberry singing under window ; but nought
wakes
hobbit - folk in the early morning . in the night little folk wake up in the
darkness [???] and sleep after light has come ! ring a ding dillo ! wake now [???] my
merry friends ! forget the nightly noises ! ring a ding dillo del ! derry del [???]
my hearties ! if you come soon you ' ll find breakfast on the table . if you
come late you ' ll get grass and rain - water ! '
needless to say - not that tom ' s threat sounded very serious - the
[???] came soon [???] and left the table late and only when it was beginning lo
look rather empty . neither tom nor goldberry were there . tom could be heard
about the house [???] [???] in the kitchen [???] and up and down the stairs [???] and
singing here and there outside . the room looked westward over the
mist - clouded valley [???] and the window was open . water dripped down from the
thatched eaves above . before they had finished breakfast the clouds had
joined into an [???] roof [???] and a straight grey rain came softly and
steadily down . behind its deep curtain the forest was completely veiled .
as they looked out of the window there came falling gently as if it was
flowing down the rain out of the sky [???] the clear voice of goldberry singing
up above them . they could hear few words [???] but it seemed plain to them that
the song was a rain - song [???] as sweet as showers on dry hills [???] that told the
tale of a river from the spring in the [???] to the sea far below . the
[???] listened with delight ; and [???] was glad in his heart [???] and blessed
the kindly weather [???] because it delayed them from departing . the thought of
going had been heavy upon him from the moment he awoke ; but he guessed
now
that they would not go further that day .
the upper wind settled in the west and deeper and wetter clouds rolled
up to spill their laden rain on the bare heads of the downs . nothing could
be seen all round the house but falling water . [???] stood near the open
door and watched the white [???] path turn into a little river of milk and

go [???] away down into the valley . tom [???] came trotting round
the
corner of the house [???] waving his arms as if he was warding off the rain - and
indeed when he sprang over the [???] he seemed quite dry [???] except for his
boots . these he took off and put in the chimney - corner . then he sat in the
largest chair and called the [???] to gather round him .
' this is goldberry ' s washing day [???] ' he said [???] ' and her autumn - cleaning .
too wet for hobbit - folk - let them rest while they are able ! it ' s a good day
for long tales [???] for questions and for answers [???] so tom will start the
talking . '
he then told them many remarkable stories [???] sometimes half as if
speaking to himself [???] sometimes looking at them suddenly with a bright blue
eye under his deep brows . often his voice would turn to song [???] and he would
get out of his chair and dance about . he told them tales of bees and
flowers [???] the ways of trees [???] and the strange creatures of the forest [???] about
the evil things and good things [???] things friendly and things [???] [???]
cruel things and kind things [???] and secrets hidden under [???] .
as they listened [???] they began to understand the lives of the forest [???]
apart from themselves [???] indeed to feel themselves as the strangers where all
other things were at home . moving constantly in and out of his talk was old
man willow [???] and [???] learned now enough to content him [???] indeed more
than
enough [???] for it was not comfortable lore . tom ' s words laid bare the hearts of
trees and their thoughts [???] which were often dark and strange [???] and filled with
a hatred of things that go free upon the earth [???] gnawing [???] biting [???] breaking [???]
hacking [???] burning : destroyers and usurpers . it was not called the old forest
without reason [???] for it was indeed ancient [???] a [???] of vast forgotten
woods ; and in it there lived yet [???] ageing no quicker than the hills [???] the
fathers of the fathers of trees [???] remembering times when they were lords . the
countless years had filled them with pride and rooted wisdom [???] and with
malice . but none were more dangerous than the great willow : his heart was
rotten [???] but his strength was green ; and he was cunning [???] and a master of
winds [???] and his song and thought ran through the woods on both sides of the
river . his grey thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth and spread like
fine root - threads in the ground [???] and invisible twig - fingers in the air [???] till
it had under its dominion nearly all the trees of the forest from the hedge
to the downs .

suddenly tom ' s talk left the woods and went leaping up the young
stream [???] over [???] [???] [???] over [???] and worn rocks [???] and among
small flowers in close grass and wet [???] [???] wandering at last up on to
the downs . they heard of the great barrows [???] and the green mounds [???] and the
stone - rings upon the hills and in the hollows among the hills . sheep were
bleating in flocks . green walls and white walls rose . there were fortresses
on the heights . kings of little kingdoms fought together [???] and the young sun
shone like fire on the red metal of their new and greedy swords . there was
victory and defeat ; and towers fell [???] fortresses were burned [???] and flames went
up into the sky . gold was piled on the biers of dead kings and queens ; and
mounds covered them [???] and the stone doors were shut ; and the grass grew over
all . sheep walked for a while biting the grass [???] but soon the hills were
empty again . a shadow came out of dark places far away [???] and the bones were
stirred in the mounds . barrow - [???] walked in the hollow places with a
clink of rings on cold fingers [???] and gold chains in the wind . ' stone rings
grinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the moonlight .
the [???] [???] . even in the shire the rumour of the
barrow - [???] of the barrow - downs beyond the forest had been heard . but it
was not a tale that any hobbit liked to listen to [???] even by a comfortable
fireside far away . these four now suddenly remembered what the joy of this
house had driven from their minds : the house of tom [???] nestled under
the very shoulder of those dreaded hills . they lost the thread of his tale
and shifted [???] [???] looking aside at one another .
when they caught his words again they found that he had now wandered
into strange regions beyond their memory and beyond their waking thought [???]
into limes when the world was wider [???] and the seas flowed straight to the
western shore ; and still on and back tom went singing out into ancient
starlight [???] when only the elf - sires were awake . then suddenly he [???] [???] and
they saw that he nodded as if he was falling asleep . the [???] sat still
before him [???] enchanted ; and it seemed as if [???] under the spell of his words [???]
the wind had gone [???] and the clouds had dried up [???] and the day had been
withdrawn [???] and darkness had come from east and west [???] and all the sky was
filled with the light of white stars .
whether the morning and evening of one day or of many days had passed
[???] could not tell . he did not feel either hungry or tired [???] only filled
with wonder . the stars shone through the window and the silence of the
heavens seemed to be round him . he spoke at last out of his wonder and a

sudden fear of that silence :
' who are you [???] master ? ' he asked .
' eh [???] what ? ' said tom sitting up [???] and his eyes [???] in the gloom .
' don ' t you know my name yet ? that ' s the only answer . tell me [???] who are you [???]
alone [???] yourself and nameless ? but you are young and i am old . eldest [???] that ' s
what i am . mark my words [???] my friends : tom was here before the river and the
trees ; tom remembers the first [???] and the first acorn . he made paths
before the big people [???] and saw the little people arriving . he was here
before the kings and the graves and the barrow - [???] . when the elves passed
westward [???] tom was here already [???] before the seas were bent . he knew the dark
under the stars when it was fearless - before the dark lord came from
outside . '
a shadow seemed to pass by the window [???] and the [???] glanced hastily
through the panes . when they turned again [???] goldberry stood in the door
behind [???] framed in light . she held a candle [???] shielding its flame from the
draught with her hand ; and the light flowed through it [???] like sunlight
through a white shell .
' the rain has ended [???] ' she said ; ' and new waters are running [???] [???]
under the stars . let us now laugh and be glad ! '
' and let us have food and drink ! ' cried tom . ' long tales are thirsty .
and long listening ' s hungry work [???] morning [???] noon [???] and evening ! ' with that he
jumped out of his chair [???] and with a bound took a candle from the
chimney - shelf and lit it in the flame that goldberry held ; then he danced
about the table . suddenly he hopped through the door and disappeared .
quickly he returned [???] bearing a large and laden tray . then tom and
goldberry set the table ; and the [???] sat half in wonder and half in
laughter : so fair was the grace of goldberry and so merry and odd the
[???] of tom . yet in some fashion they seemed to weave a single dance [???]
neither hindering the other [???] in and out of the room [???] and round about the
table ; and with great speed food and vessels and lights were set in order .
the boards blazed with candles [???] white and yellow . tom bowed to his guests .
' supper is ready [???] ' said goldberry ; and now the [???] saw that she was
clothed all in silver with a white girdle [???] and her shoes were like fishes '
mail . but tom was all in clean blue [???] blue as rain - washed forget - me - nots [???] and
he had green stockings .
it was a supper even better than before . the [???] under the spell of

tom ' s words may have missed one meal or many [???] but when the food was
before
them it seemed at least a week since they had eaten . they did not sing or
even speak much for a while [???] and paid close attention to business . but after
a time their hearts and spirit rose high again [???] and their voices rang out in
mirth and laughter .
after they had eaten [???] goldberry sang many songs for them [???] songs that
began merrily in the hills and fell softly down into silence ; and in the
silences they saw in their minds [???] and waters wider than any they had
known [???] and looking into them they saw the sky below them and the stars like
jewels in the depths . then once more she wished them each good night and
left them by the fireside . but tom now seemed wide awake and plied them
with
questions .
he appeared already to know much about them and all their [???] [???] and
indeed to know much of all the history and doings of the shire down from
days hardly remembered among the [???] themselves . it no longer surprised
them ; but he made no secret that he owed his recent knowledge largely to
farmer [???] [???] whom he seemed to regard as a person of more importance
than
they had imagined . ' there ' s earth under his old feet [???] and clay on his
fingers ; wisdom in his bones [???] and both his eyes are open [???] ' said tom . it was
also clear that tom had dealings with the elves [???] and it seemed that in some
fashion [???] news had reached him from gildor concerning the flight of [???] .
indeed so much did tom know [???] and so cunning was his questioning [???] that
[???] found himself telling him more about [???] and his own hopes and fears
than he had told before even to [???] . tom wagged his head up and down [???]
and there was a glint in his eyes when he heard of the riders .
' show me the precious ring ! ' he said suddenly in the midst of the
story : and [???] [???] to his own astonishment [???] drew out the chain from his
pocket [???] and [???] the ring handed it at once to tom .
it seemed to grow larger as it lay for a moment on his big
brown - skinned hand . then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed . for a
second the [???] had a vision [???] both comical and alarming [???] of his bright
blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold . then tom put the ring round the
end of his little finger and held it up to the candlelight . for a moment the
[???] noticed nothing strange about this . then they gasped . there was no

sign of tom disappearing !
tom laughed again [???] and then he spun the ring in the air - and it
vanished with a flash . [???] gave a cry - and tom leaned forward and handed
it back to him with a smile .
[???] looked at it closely [???] and rather suspiciously ( like one who has
lent a [???] to a [???] ) . it was the same ring [???] or looked the same and
weighed the same : for that ring had always seemed to [???] to weigh
strangely heavy in the hand . but something prompted him to make sure . he
was
perhaps a trifle annoyed with tom for seeming to make so light of what even
[???] thought so perilously important . he waited for an opportunity [???] when
the talk was going again [???] and tom was telling an absurd story about [???]
and their queer ways - then he slipped the ring on .
merry turned towards him to say something and gave a start [???] and checked
an exclamation . [???] was delighted ( in a way ) : it was his own ring all
right [???] for merry was staring blankly at his chair [???] and obviously could not
see him . he got up and crept quietly away from the fireside towards the
outer door .
' hey there ! ' cried tom [???] glancing towards him with a most seeing look in
his shining eyes . ' hey ! come [???] [???] there ! where be you a - going ? old tom
[???] ' s not as blind as that yet . take off your golden ring ! your hand ' s
more fair without it . come back ! leave your game and sit down beside me !
we
must talk a while more [???] and think about the morning . tom must teach the
right road [???] and keep your feet from wandering . '
[???] laughed ( trying to feel pleased ) [???] and taking off the ring he came
and sat down again . tom now told them that he reckoned the sun would shine
tomorrow [???] and it would be a glad morning [???] and setting out would be hopeful .
but they would do well to start early ; for weather in that country was a
thing that even tom could not be sure of for long [???] and it would change
sometimes quicker than he could change his jacket . ' i am no weather - master [???] '
he said ; ' nor is aught that goes on two legs . '
by his advice they decided to make nearly due north from his house [???]
over the western and lower [???] of the downs : they might hope in that way
to strike the east road in a day ' s journey [???] and avoid the barrows . he told
them not to be afraid - but to mind their own business .
' keep to the green grass . don ' t you go a - meddling with old stone or

cold [???] or prying in their houses [???] unless you be strong folk with hearts
that never falter ! ' he said this more than once ; and he advised them to pass
barrows by on the west - side [???] if they chanced to stray near one . then he
taught them a rhyme to sing [???] if they should by ill - luck fall into any danger
or difficulty the next day .
ho ! tom [???] [???] tom [???] !
by water [???] wood and hill [???] by the reed and willow [???]
by fire [???] sun and moon [???] harken now and hear us !
come [???] tom [???] [???] for our need is near us !
when they had sung this altogether after him [???] he clapped them each on
the shoulder with a laugh [???] and taking candles led them back to their
bedroom .




chapter 8 . fog on the barrow - downs



that night they heard no noises . but either in his dreams or out of
them [???] he could not tell which [???] [???] heard a sweet singing running in his
mind ; a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a grey
rain - curtain [???] and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver [???]
until at last it was rolled back [???] and a far green country opened before him
under a swift [???] .
the vision melted into waking ; and there was tom whistling like a
tree - full of birds ; and the sun was already [???] down the hill and
through the open window . outside everything was green and pale gold .
after breakfast [???] which they again ate alone [???] they made ready to say
farewell [???] as nearly heavy of heart as was possible on such a morning : cool [???]
bright [???] and clean under a washed autumn sky of thin blue . the air came fresh
from the north - west . their quiet [???] were almost [???] [???] [???] and
moving restlessly . tom came out of the house and waved his hat and danced
upon the doorstep [???] bidding the [???] to get up and be off and go with good
speed .
they rode off along a path that wound away from behind the house [???] and
went [???] up towards the north end of the hill - brow under which it
sheltered . they had just [???] to lead their [???] up the last steep
slope [???] when suddenly [???] stopped .
' goldberry ! ' he cried . ' my fair lady [???] clad all in silver green ! we have
never said farewell to her [???] nor seen her since the evening ! ' he was so
distressed tha t he turned back ; but at that moment a clear call came
[???] down . there on the hill - brow she stood [???] to them : her hair
was flying loose [???] and as it caught the sun it shone and [???] . a light
like the glint of water on dewy grass flashed from under her feet as she
danced .
they hastened up the last slope [???] and stood breathless beside her . they
bowed [???] but with a wave of her arm she bade them look round ; and they looked
out from the hill - top over lands under the morning . it was now as clear and
far - seen as it had been veiled and misty when they stood upon the knoll in
the forest [???] which could now be seen rising pale and green out of the dark
trees in the west . in that direction the land rose in wooded ridges [???] green [???]

yellow [???] russet under the sun [???] beyond which lay hidden the valley of the
[???] . to the south [???] over the line of the [???] [???] there was a
distant glint like pale glass where the [???] river made a great loop
in the [???] and flowed away out of the knowledge of the [???] .
northward beyond the [???] downs the land ran away in flats and
swellings of grey and green and pale earth - colours [???] until it faded into a
featureless and shadowy distance . eastward the barrow - downs rose [???] ridge
behind ridge into the morning [???] and vanished out of eyesight into a guess : it
was no more than a guess of blue and a remote white glimmer [???] with
the hem of the sky [???] but it spoke to them [???] out of memory and old tales [???] of
the high and distant mountains .
they took a deep draught of the air [???] and felt that a skip and a few
stout strides would bear them wherever they wished . it seemed [???]
to go jogging aside over the [???] skirts of the downs towards the road [???]
when they should be leaping [???] as lusty as tom [???] over the stepping stones of
the hills straight towards the mountains .
goldberry spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoughts . ' speed
now [???] fair guests ! ' she said . ' and hold to your purpose ! north with the wind
in the left eye and a blessing on your [???] ! make haste while the sun
shines ! ' and to [???] she said : ' farewell [???] elf - friend [???] it was a merry
meeting ! '
but [???] found no words to answer . he bowed low [???] and mounted his pony [???]
and followed by his friends jogged slowly down the gentle slope behind the
hill . tom [???] ' s house and the valley [???] and the forest were lost to view .
the air grew warmer between the green walls of hillside and hillside [???] and
the scent of turf rose strong and sweet as they breathed . turning back [???] when
they reached the bottom of the green hollow [???] they saw goldberry [???] now small
and slender like a [???] flower against the sky : she was standing still
watching them [???] and her hands were stretched out towards them . as they looked
she gave a clear call [???] and lifting up her hand she turned and vanished
behind the hill .
their way wound along the floor of the hollow [???] and round the green feet
of a steep hill into another deeper and broader valley [???] and then over the
shoulder of further hills [???] and down their long limbs [???] and up their smooth
sides again [???] up on to new hill - tops and down into new [???] . there was no
tree nor any visible water : it was a country of grass and short springy
turf [???] silent except for the whisper of the air over the edges of the land [???]

and high lonely cries of strange birds . as they journeyed the sun mounted [???]
and grew hot . each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown
less . when they caught a glimpse of the country westward the distant forest
seemed to be smoking [???] as if the fallen rain was steaming up again from leaf
and root and mould . a shadow now lay round the edge of sight [???] a dark haze
above which the upper sky was like a blue cap [???] hot and heavy .
about mid - day they came to a hill whose top was wide and [???] [???]
like a shallow saucer with a green mounded rim . inside there was no air
stirring [???] and the sky seemed near their heads . they rode across and looked
northwards . then their hearts rose [???] for it seemed plain that they had come
further already than they had expected . certainly the distances had now all
become hazy and [???] [???] but there could be no doubt that the downs were
coming to an end . a long valley la y below them winding away northwards [???]
until it came to an opening between two steep shoulders . beyond [???] there
seemed to be no more hills . due north they faintly [???] a long dark
line . that is a line of trees [???] ' said merry [???] ' and that must mark the road .
all along it for many leagues east of the bridge there are trees growing .
some say they were planted in the old days . '
' [???] ! ' said [???] . ' if we make as good going this afternoon as we
have done this morning [???] we shall have left the downs before the sun sets and
be jogging on in search of a camping place . ' but even as he spoke he turned
his glance eastwards [???] and he saw that on that side the hills were higher and
looked down upon them ; and all those hills were crowned with green mounds [???]
and on some were standing stones [???] pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of
green gums .
that view was somehow [???] ; so they turned from the sight and
went down into the hollow circle . in the midst of it there stood a single
stone [???] standing tall under the sun above [???] and at this hour casting no
shadow . it was shapeless and yet [???] : like a landmark [???] or a guarding
finger [???] or more like a warning . but they were now hungry [???] and the sun was
still at the fearless noon ; so they set their backs against the east side of
the stone . it was cool [???] as if the sun had had no power to warm it ; but at
that time this seemed pleasant . there they took food and drink [???] and made as
good a noon - meal under the open sky as anyone could wish ; for the food came
from ' down under hill ' . tom had provided them with plenty for the comfort of
the day . their [???] [???] strayed upon the grass .
riding over the hills [???] and eating their fill [???] the warm sun and the

scent of turf [???] lying a little too long [???] stretching out their legs and
looking at the sky above their noses : these things are [???] perhaps [???] enough to
explain what happened . however [???] that may be : they woke suddenly and
uncomfortably from a sleep they had never meant to take . the standing stone
was cold [???] and it cast a long pale shadow that stretched eastward over them .
the sun [???] a pale and watery yellow [???] was gleaming through the mist just above
the west wall of the hollow in which they lay ; north [???] south [???] and east [???]
beyond the wall the fog was thick [???] cold and white . the air was silent [???] heavy
and chill . their [???] were standing crowded together with their heads
down .
the [???] sprang to their feet in alarm [???] and ran to the western rim .
they found that they were upon an island in the fog . even as they looked out
in dismay towards the setting sun [???] it sank before their eyes into a white
sea [???] and a cold grey shadow sprang up in the east behind . the fog rolled up
to the walls and rose above them [???] and as it mounted it bent over their heads
until it became a roof : they were shut in a hall of mist whose central
pillar was the standing stone .
they felt as if a trap was closing about them ; but they did not quite
lose heart . they still remembered the hopeful view they had had of the line
of the road ahead [???] and they still knew in which direction it lay . in any
case [???] they now had so great a dislike for that hollow place about the stone
that no thought of remaining there was in their minds . they packed up as
quickly as their chilled fingers would work .
soon they were leading their [???] in single file over the rim and
down the long northward slope of the hill [???] down into a [???] sea . as they
went down the mist became colder and damper [???] and their hair hung lank and
dripping on their foreheads . when they reached the bottom it was so cold
that they halted and got out cloaks and hoods [???] which soon became [???]
with grey drops . then [???] mounting their [???] [???] they went sl owly on again [???]
feeling their way by the rise and fall of the ground . they were steering [???] as
well as they could guess [???] for the gate - like opening at the far northward end
of the long valley which they had seen in the morning . once they were
through the gap [???] they had only lo keep on in anything like a straight line
and they were bound in the end to strike the road . their thoughts did not go
beyond that [???] except for a vague hope that perhaps away beyond the downs
there might be no fog .
their going was very slow . to prevent their getting separated and

wandering in different directions they went in file [???] with [???] leading . sam
was behind him [???] and after him came [???] [???] and then merry . the valley
seemed
to stretch on endlessly . suddenly [???] saw a hopeful sign . on either side
ahead a darkness began to loom through the mist ; and he guessed that they
were at last approaching the gap in the hills [???] the north - gate of the
barrow - downs . if they could pass that [???] they would be free .
' come on ! follow me ! ' he called back over his shoulder [???] and he hurried
forward . but his hope soon changed to [???] and alarm . the dark
patches grew darker [???] but they shrank ; and suddenly he saw [???] towering [???]
before him and leaning slightly towards one another like the pillars of a
headless door [???] two huge standing stones . he could not remember having seen
any sign of these in the valley [???] when he looked out from the hill in the
morning . he had passed between them almost before he was aware : and even
as
he did so darkness seemed to fall round him . his pony reared and snorted [???]
and he fell off . when he looked back he found that he was alone : the others
had not followed him . ' sam ! ' he called . ' [???] ! merry ! come along ! why
don ' t you keep up ? '
there was no answer . fear took him [???] and he ran back past the stones
shouting wildly : ' sam ! sam ! merry ! [???] ! ' the pony bolted into the mist
and vanished . from some way off [???] or so it seemed [???] he thought he heard a cry :
' hoy ! [???] ! hoy ! ' it was away eastward [???] on his left as he stood under the
great stones [???] staring and straining into the gloom . he [???] off in the
direction of the call [???] and found himself going steeply [???] .
as he struggled on he called again [???] and kept on calling more and more
frantically ; but he heard no answer for some time [???] and then it seemed faint
and far ahead and high above him . ' [???] ! hoy ! ' came the thin voices out of
the mist : and then a cry that sounded like help [???] help ! often repeated [???]
ending with a last help ! that trailed off into a long wail suddenly cut
short . he [???] forward with all the speed he could towards the cries ;
but the light was now gone [???] and [???] night had closed about him [???] so that
it was impossible to be sure of any direction . he seemed all the time to be
climbing up and up .
only the change in the level of the ground at his feet told him when he
at last came to the top of a ridge or hill . he was weary [???] sweating and yet
chilled . it was wholly dark .

' where are you ? ' he cried out miserably .
there was no reply . he stood listening . he was suddenly aware that it
was getting very cold [???] and that up here a wind was beginning to blow [???] an icy
wind . a change was coming in the weather . the mist was flowing past him
now
in shreds and [???] . his breath was smoking [???] and the darkness was less
near and thick . he looked up and saw with surprise that faint stars were
appearing overhead amid the [???] of hurrying cloud and fog . the wind
began to hiss over the grass .
he imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry [???] and he made towards
it ; and even as he went forward the mist was rolled up and thrust aside [???] and
the starry sky was [???] . a glance showed him that he was now facing
southwards and was on a round hill - top [???] which he must have climbed from the
north . out of the east the biting wind was blowing . to his right there
loomed against the westward stars a dark black shape . a great barrow stood
there .
' where are you ? ' he cried again [???] both angry and afraid .
' here ! ' said a voice [???] deep and cold [???] that seemed to come out of the
ground . ' i am waiting for you ! '
' no ! ' said [???] ; but he did not run away . his knees gave [???] and he fell
on the ground . nothing happened [???] and there was no sound . trembling he
looked
up [???] in time to see a tall dark figure like a shadow against the stars . it
leaned over him . he thought there were two eyes [???] very cold though lit with a
pale light that seemed to come from some remote distance . then a grip
stronger and colder than iron seized him . the icy touch froze his bones [???] and
he remembered no more .
when he came to himself again [???] for a moment he could recall nothing
except a sense of dread . then suddenly he knew that he was imprisoned [???]
caught hopelessly ; he was in a barrow . a barrow - wight had taken him [???] and he
was probably already under the dreadful spells of the barrow - [???] about
which whispered tales spoke . he dared not move [???] but lay as he found himself :
flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his breast .
but though his fear was so great that it seemed to be part of the very
darkness that was round him [???] he found himself as he lay thinking about [???]
[???] and his stories [???] of their jogging along together in the lanes of the
shire and talking about roads and adventures . there is a seed of courage

hidden ( often deeply [???] it is true ) in the heart of the [???] and most timid
hobbit [???] wailing for some final and desperate danger to make it grow . [???]
was neither very fat nor very timid ; indeed [???] though he did not know it [???]
[???] ( and [???] ) had thought him the best hobbit in the shire . he thought
he had come to the end of his adventure [???] and a terrible end [???] but the thought
hardened him . he found himself stiffening [???] as if for a final spring ; he no
longer felt limp like a helpless prey .
as he lay there [???] thinking and getting a hold of himself [???] he noticed all
at once that the darkness was slowly giving way : a pale greenish light was
growing round him . it did not at first show him what kind of a place he was
in [???] for the light seemed to be coming out of himself [???] and from the floor
beside him [???] and had not yet reached the roof or wall . he turned [???] and there
in the cold glow he saw lying beside him sam [???] [???] [???] and merry . they were
on their backs [???] and their faces looked deathly pale ; and they were clad in
white . about them lay many treasures [???] of gold maybe [???] though in that light
they looked cold and [???] . on their heads were circlets [???] gold chains
were about their waists [???] and on their fingers were many rings . swords lay by
their sides [???] and shields were at their feet . but across their three necks
lay one long naked sword .
suddenly a song began : a cold murmur [???] rising and falling . the voice
seemed far away and [???] dreary [???] sometimes high in the air and thin [???]
sometimes like a low moan from the ground . out of the formless stream of sad
but horrible sounds [???] strings of words would now and again shape themselves :
grim [???] hard [???] cold words [???] heartless and miserable . the night was railing
against the morning of which it was [???] [???] and the cold was cursing the
warmth for which it hungered . [???] was chilled to the marrow . after a while
the song became clearer [???] and with dread in his heart he perceived that it
had changed into an [???] :
cold be hand and heart and bone [???]
and cold be sleep under stone :
never mare to wake on stony bed [???]
never [???] till the sun fails and the moon is dead .
in the black wind the stars shall die [???]
and still on gold here let them lie [???]
till the dark lord lifts his hand
over dead sea and withered land .
he heard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound . raising himself

on one arm he looked [???] and saw now in the pale light that they were in a kind
of passage which behind them turned a corner . round the corner a long arm
was groping [???] walking on its fingers towards sam [???] who was lying nearest [???] and
towards the hilt of the sword that lay upon him .
at first [???] felt as if he had indeed been turned into stone by the
[???] . then a wild thought of escape came to him . he wondered if he
put on the ring [???] whether the barrow - wight would miss him [???] and he might find
some way ou t . he thought of himself running free over the grass [???] grieving
for merry [???] and sam [???] and [???] [???] but free and alive himself . [???] would
admit that there had been nothing else he could do .
but the courage that had been awakened in him was now too strong : he
could not leave his friends so easily . he wavered [???] groping in his pocket [???]
and then fought with himself again ; and as he did so the arm crept nearer .
suddenly resolve hardened in him [???] and he seized a short sword that lay
beside him [???] and kneeling he stooped low over the bodies of his companions .
with what strength he had he hewed at the [???] arm near the wrist [???] and
the hand broke off ; but at the same moment the sword [???] up to the
hilt . there was a shriek and the light vanished . in the dark there was a
[???] noise .
[???] fell forward over merry [???] and merry ' s face felt cold . all at once
back into his mind [???] from which it had disappeared with the first coming of
the fog [???] came the memory of the house down under the hill [???] and of tom
singing . he remembered the rhyme that tom had taught them . in a small
desperate voice he began : ho ! tom [???] ! and with that name his voice
seemed to grow strong : it had a full and lively sound [???] and the dark chamber
echoed as if to drum and trumpet .
ho ! tom [???] [???] tom [???] !
by water [???] wood and hill [???] by the reed and willow [???]
by fire [???] sun and moon [???] harken now and hear us !
come [???] tom [???] [???] for our need is near us !
there was a sudden deep silence [???] in which [???] could hear his heart
beating . after a long slow moment he heard plain [???] but far away [???] as if it was
coming down through the ground or through thick walls [???] an answering voice
singing :
old tom [???] is a merry fellow [???]
bright blue his jacket is [???] and his boots are yellow .
none has ever caught him yet [???] for tom [???] he is the master :

his songs are stronger songs [???] and his feet are faster .
there was a loud rumbling sound [???] as of stones rolling and falling [???] and
suddenly light streamed in [???] real light [???] the plain light of day . a low
door - like opening appeared at the end of the chamber beyond [???] ' s feet ;
and there was tom ' s head ( hat [???] feather [???] and all ) framed against the light of
the sun rising red behind him . the light fell upon the floor [???] and upon the
faces of the three [???] lying beside [???] . they did not stir [???] but the
sickly hue had left them . they looked now as if they were only very deeply
asleep .
tom stooped [???] removed his hat [???] and came into the dark chamber [???] singing :
get out [???] you old wight ! vanish in the sunlight !
shrivel like the cold mist [???] like the winds go wailing [???]
out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains !
come never here again ! leave your barrow empty !
lost and forgotten be [???] darker than the darkness [???]
where gates stand for ever shut [???] till the world is mended .
at these words there was a cry and part of the inner end of the chamber
fell in with a crash . then there was a long trailing shriek [???] fading away
into an [???] distance ; and after that silence .
' come [???] friend [???] ! ' said tom . ' let us get out on to clean grass ! you
must help me bear them . '
together they carried out merry [???] [???] [???] and sam . as [???] left the
barrow for the last time he thought he saw a severed hand [???] still [???]
like a wounded spider [???] in a heap of fallen earth . tom went back in again [???]
and there was a sound of much thumping and stamping . when he came out he
was
bearing in his arms a great load of treasure : things of gold [???] silver [???]
copper [???] and [???] ; many beads and chains and jewelled ornaments . he
climbed
the green barrow and laid them all on top in the sunshine .
there he stood [???] with his hat in his hand and the wind in his hair [???] and
looked down upon the three [???] [???] that had been laid on their backs upon
the grass at the west side of the mound . raising his right hand he said in a
clear and commanding voice :
wake now my merry tads ! wake and hear me calling !
warm now be heart and limb ! the cold stone is fallen ;
dark door is standing wide ; dead hand is broken .

night under night is flown [???] and the gate is open !
to [???] ' s great joy the [???] stirred [???] stretched their arms [???] rubbed
their eyes [???] and then suddenly sprang up . they looked about in amazement [???]
first at [???] [???] and then at tom standing large as life on the barrow - top
above them ; and then at themselves in their thin white rags [???] crowned and
belted with pale gold [???] and [???] with [???] .
' what in the name of wonder ? ' began merry [???] feeling the golden circlet
that had slipped over one eye . then he stopped [???] and a shadow came over his
face [???] and he closed his eyes . ' of course [???] i remember ! ' he said . ' the men of
carn dym came on us at night [???] and we were worsted . ah ! the spear in my
heart ! ' he clutched at his breast . ' no ! no ! ' he said [???] opening his eyes .
' what am i saying ? i have been dreaming . where did you get to [???] [???] ? '
' i thought that i was lost [???] ' said [???] ; ' but i don ' t want to speak of
it . let us think of what we are to do now ! let us go on ! '
' dressed up like this [???] sir ? ' said sam . ' where are my clothes ? ' he flung
his circlet [???] belt [???] and rings on the grass [???] and looked round helplessly [???] as
if he expected to find his cloak [???] jacket [???] and breeches [???] and other
hobbit - garments lying somewhere to hand .
' you won ' t find your clothes again [???] ' said tom [???] bounding down from the
mound [???] and laughing as he danced round them in the sunlight . one would have
thought that nothing dangerous or dreadful had happened ; and indeed the
horror faded out of their hearts as they looked at him [???] and saw the merry
glint in his eyes .
' what do you mean ? ' asked [???] [???] looking at him [???] half puzzled and half
amused . ' why not ? '
but tom shook his head [???] saying : ' you ' ve found yourselves again [???] out of
the deep water . clothes are but little loss [???] if you escape from drowning . be
glad [???] my merry friends [???] and let the warm sunlight heal now heart and limb !
cast off these cold rags ! run naked on the grass [???] while tom goes a - hunting ! '
he sprang away down hill [???] whistling and calling . looking down after him
[???] saw him running away southwards along the green hollow between
their
hill and the next [???] still whistling and crying :
hey ! now ! come hoy now ! whither do you wander ?
up [???] down [???] near or far [???] here [???] there or yonder ?
sharp - ears [???] wise - nose [???] swish - tail and [???] [???]
white - socks my little lad [???] and old fatty lumpkin !

so he sang [???] running fast [???] tossi ng up his hat and catching it [???] until he
was hidden by a fold of the ground : but for some time his hey now ! hoy now !
came floating back down the wind [???] which had shifted round towards the south .
the air was growing very warm again . the [???] ran about for a while
on the grass [???] as he told them . then they lay basking in the sun with the
delight of those that have been [???] suddenly from bitter winter to a
friendly clime [???] or of people that [???] after being long ill and [???] [???] wake
one day to find that they are [???] well and the day is again full of
promise .
by the time that tom returned they were feeling strong ( and hungry ) . he
reappeared [???] hat first [???] over the brow of the hill [???] and behind him came in an
obedient line six [???] : their own five and one more . the last was plainly
old fatty lumpkin : he was larger [???] stronger [???] fatter ( and older ) than their
own [???] . merry [???] to whom the others belonged [???] had not [???] in fact [???] given them
any such names [???] but they answered to the new names that tom had given
them
for the rest of their lives . tom called them one by one and they climbed
over the brow and stood in a line . then tom bowed to the [???] .
' here are your [???] [???] now ! ' he said . ' they ' ve more sense ( in some
ways ) than you wandering [???] have - more sense in their noses . for they
sniff danger ahead which you walk right into ; and if they run to save
themselves [???] then they run the right way . you must forgive them all ; for
though their hearts are faithful [???] to face fear of barrow - [???] is not what
they were made for . see [???] here they come again [???] bringing all their burdens ! '
merry [???] sam [???] and [???] now clothed themselves in spare garments from
their packs ; and they soon felt too hot [???] for they were obliged to put on
some of the thicker and warmer things that they had brought against the
[???] of winter .
' where does that other old animal [???] that fatty lumpkin [???] come from ? '
asked [???] .
' he ' s mine [???] ' said tom . ' my four - legged friend ; though i seldom ride
him [???] and he wanders often far [???] free upon the hillsides . when your [???]
stayed with me [???] they got to know my lumpkin ; and they smelt him in the
night [???] and quickly ran to meet him . i thought he ' d look for them and with
his words of wisdom take all their fear away . but now [???] my jolly lumpkin [???] old
tom ' s going to ride . hey ! he ' s coming with you [???] just to set you on the road ;
so he needs a pony . for you cannot easily talk to [???] that are riding [???]

when you ' re on your own legs trying to trot beside them . '
the [???] were delighted to hear this [???] and thanked tom many times ;
but he laughed [???] and said that they were so good at losing themselves that he
would not feel happy till he had seen them safe over the borders of his
land . ' i ' ve got things to do [???] ' he said : ' my making and my singing [???] my
talking and my walking [???] and my watching of the country . tom can ' t be always
near to open doors and willow - cracks . tom has his house to mind [???] and
goldberry is wait ing . '
it was still fairly early by the sun [???] something between nine and ten [???]
and the [???] turned their minds to food . their last meal had been lunch
beside the standing stone the day before . they breakfasted now off the
remainder of tom ' s provisions [???] meant for their supper [???] with additions that
tom had brought with him . it was not a large meal ( considering [???] and
the circumstances ) [???] but they felt much better for it . while they were eating
tom went up to the mound [???] and looked through the treasures . most of these he
made into a pile that [???] and sparkled on the grass . he bade them lie
there ' free to all finders [???] birds [???] beasts . elves or men [???] and all kindly
creatures ' ; for so the spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and
no wight ever come back to it . he chose for himself from the pile a brooch
set with blue stones [???] many - shaded like flax - flowers or the wings of blue
[???] . he looked long at it [???] as if stirred by some memory [???] shaking his
head [???] and saying at last :
' here is a pretty toy for tom and for his lady ! fair was she who long
ago wore this on her shoulder . goldberry shall wear it now [???] and we will not
forget her ! '
for each of the [???] he chose a dagger [???] long [???] leaf - shaped [???] and keen [???]
of marvellous [???] [???] [???] with serpent - forms in red and gold .
they
gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths [???] wrought of some strange
metal [???] light and strong [???] and set with many fiery stones . whether by some
virtue in these sheaths or because of the spell that lay on the mound [???] the
blades seemed [???] by time [???] [???] [???] sharp [???] glittering in the sun .
' old knives are long enough as swords for hobbit - people [???] ' he said .
' sharp blades are good to have [???] if shire - folk go walking [???] east [???] south [???] or
far away into dark and danger . ' then he told them that these blades were
forged many long years ago by men of westernesse : they were foes of the
dark

lord [???] but they were overcome by the evil king of carn dym in the land of
[???] .
' few now remember them [???] ' tom murmured [???] ' yet still some go wandering [???]
sons of forgotten kings walking in loneliness [???] guarding from evil things
folk that are heedless . '
the [???] did not understand his words [???] but as he spoke they had a
vision as it were of a great [???] of years behind them [???] like a vast
shadowy plain over which there strode shapes of men [???] tall and grim with
bright swords [???] and last came one with a star on his brow . then the vision
faded [???] and they were back in the [???] world . it was time to start again .
they made ready [???] packing their bags and lading their [???] . their new
weapons they hung on their leather belts under their jackets [???] feeling them
very [???] [???] and wondering if they would be of any use . fighting had not
before occurred to any of them as one of the adventures in which their
flight would land them .
at last they set off . they led their [???] down the hill ; and then
mounting they trotted quickly along the valley . they looked back and saw the
top of the old mound on the hill [???] and from it the sunlight on the gold went
up like a yellow flame . then they turned a shoulder of the downs and it was
hidden from view .
though [???] looked about him on every side he saw no sign of the great
stones standing like a gate [???] and before long they came to the northern gap
and rode swiftly through [???] and the land fell away before them . it was a merry
journey with tom [???] trotting gaily beside them [???] or before them [???] on
fatty lumpkin [???] who could move much faster than his girth promised . tom
sang
most of the time [???] but it was chiefly nonsense [???] or else perhaps a strange
language unknown to the [???] [???] an ancient language whose words were
mainly
those of wonder and delight .
they went forward steadily [???] but they soon saw that the road was further
away than they had imagined . even without a fog [???] their sleep at mid - day
would have prevented them from reaching it until after nightfall on the day
before . the dark line they had seen was not a line of trees but a line of
bushes growing on the edge of a deep dike with a steep wall on the further
side . tom said that it had once been the boundary of a kingdom [???] but a very
long lime ago . he seemed to remember something sad about it [???] and would not

say much .
they climbed down and out of the dike and through a gap in the wall [???]
and then tom turned due north [???] for they had been bearing somewhat to the
west . the land was now open and fairly level [???] and they quickened their pace [???]
but the sun was already sinking low when at last they saw a line of tall
trees ahead [???] and they knew that they had come back to the road after many
unexpected adventures . they [???] their [???] over the last [???] [???]
and halted u nder the long shadows of the trees . they were on the top of a
[???] bank [???] and the road [???] now dim as evening drew on [???] wound away
below
them . at this point it ran nearly from south - west to north - east [???] and on
their right it fell quickly down into a wide hollow . it was rutted and bore
many signs of the recent heavy rain ; there were [???] and pot - holes full of
water . they rode down the bank and looked up and down . there was nothing
to
be seen . ' well [???] here we are again at last ! ' said [???] . ' i suppose we
haven ' t lost more than two days by my short cut through the forest ! but
perhaps the delay will prove useful - it may have put them off our trail . '
the others looked at him . the shadow of the fear of the black riders
came suddenly over them again . ever since they had entered the forest they
had thought chiefly of getting back to the road ; only now when it lay
beneath their feet did they remember the danger which pursued them [???] and was
more than likely to be lying in wait for them upon the road itself . they
looked anxiously back towards the setting sun [???] but the road was brown and
empty .
' do you think [???] ' asked [???] [???] [???] ' do you think we may be
pursued [???] tonight ? '
' no [???] i hope not tonight [???] ' answered tom [???] ; ' nor perhaps the next
day . but do not trust my guess ; for i cannot tell for certain . out east my
knowledge fails . tom is not master of riders from the black land far beyond
his country . '
all the same the [???] wished he was coming with them . they felt that
he would know how to deal with black riders [???] if anyone did . they would
soon
now be going forward into lands wholly strange to them [???] and beyond all but
the most vague and distant [???] of the shire [???] and in the gathering
[???] they longed for home . a deep loneliness and sense of loss was on

them . they stood silent [???] [???] to make the final parting [???] and only
slowly became aware that tom was wishing them farewell [???] and telling them to
have good heart and to ride on till dark without halting .
' tom will give you good advice [???] till this day is over ( after that your
own luck must go with you and guide you ) : four miles along the road you ' ll
come upon a village [???] bree under bree - hill [???] with doors looking westward .
there you ' ll find an old inn that is called the prancing pony . [???]
[???] is the worthy keeper . there you can stay the night [???] and afterwards
the morning will speed you upon your way . be bold [???] but wary ! keep up your
merry hearts [???] and ride to meet your fortune ! '
they begged him to come at least as far as the inn and drink once more
with them ; but he laughed and refused [???] saying :
tom ' s country ends here : he will not pass the borders .
tom has his house to mind [???] and goldberry is waiting !
then he turned [???] tossed up his hat [???] leaped on lumpkin ' s back [???] and rode
up over the bank and away singing into the [???] .
the [???] climbed up and watched him until he was out of sight .
' i am sorry to take leave of master [???] [???] ' said sam . ' he ' s a
caution and no mistake . i reckon we may go a good deal further and see
naught better [???] nor [???] . but i won ' t deny i ' ll be glad to see this
prancing pony he spoke of . i hope it ' ll be like the green dragon away back
home ! what sort of folk are they in bree ? '
' there are [???] in bree [???] ' said merry [???] ' as well as big folk . i
daresay it will be homelike enough . the pony is a good inn by all accounts .
my people ride out there now and again . '
' it may be all we could wish [???] ' said [???] ; ' but it is outside the shire
all the same . don ' t make yourselves too much at home ! please remember - all
of you - that the name of [???] must not be mentioned . i am mr . [???] [???]
if any name must be given . '
they now mounted their [???] and rode off silently into the evening .
darkness came down quickly [???] as they [???] slowly [???] and up again [???]
until at last they saw lights [???] some distance ahead .
before them rose bree - hill barring the way [???] a dark mass against misty
stars ; and under its western flank nestled a large village . towards it they
now hurried desiring only to find a fire [???] and a door between them and the
night .




chapter 9 . at the sign of



the prancing pony
bree was the chief village of the bree - land [???] a small inhabited region [???]
like an island in the empty lands round about . besides bree itself [???] there
was [???] on the other side of the hill [???] combe in a deep valley a little
further eastward [???] and archet on the edge of the [???] . lying round
bree - hill and the villages was a small country of fields and tamed woodland
only a few miles broad .
the men of bree were brown - haired [???] broad [???] and rather short [???] cheerful
and [???] : they belonged to nobody but themselves ; but they were more
friendly and familiar with [???] [???] [???] [???] elves [???] and other inhabitants of
the world about them than was ( or is ) usual with big people . according to
their own tales they were the original inhabitants and wer e the descendants
of the first men that ever wandered into the west of the middle - world . few
had survived the [???] of the elder days ; but when the kings returned
again over the great sea they had found the bree - men still there [???] and they
were st ill there now [???] when the memory of the old kings had faded into the
grass .
in those days no other men had settled dwellings so far west [???] or within
a hundred leagues of the shire . but in the wild lands beyond bree there were
mysterious wanderers . the bree - folk called them rangers [???] and knew nothing
of
their origin . they were taller and darker than the men of bree and were
believed to have strange powers of sight and hearing [???] and to understand the
languages of beasts and birds . they roamed at will southwards [???] and eastwards
even as far as the misty mountains ; but they were now few and rarely seen .
when they appeared they brought news from afar [???] and told strange forgotten
tales which were eagerly listened to ; but the bree - folk did not make friends
of them .
there were also many [???] of [???] in the bree - land and they
claimed to be the oldest settlement of [???] in the world [???] one that was
founded long before even the [???] was crossed and the shire [???] .
they lived mostly in [???] though there were some in bree itself [???]
especially on the higher [???] of the hill [???] above the houses of the men .

the big folk and the little folk ( as they called one another ) were on
friendly terms [???] minding their own affairs in their own ways [???] but both
rightly regarding themselves as necessary parts of the bree - folk . nowhere
else in the world was this peculiar ( but excellent ) arrangement to be found .
the bree - folk [???] big and little [???] did not themselves travel much ; and the
affairs of the four villages were their chief concern . occasionally the
[???] of bree went as far as buckland [???] or the [???] ; but though
their link land was not much further than a day ' s riding east of the
[???] bridge [???] the [???] of the shire now seldom visited it . an
occasional [???] or adventurous took would come out to the inn for a
night or two [???] but even that was becoming less and less usual . the
shire - [???] referred to those of bree [???] and to any others that lived beyond
the borders [???] as [???] [???] and took very little interest in them [???]
considering them dull and uncouth . there were probably many more
[???]
scattered about in the west of the world in those days than the people of
the shire imagined . some [???] doubtless [???] were no better than tramps [???] ready to
dig a hole in any bank and stay only as long as it suited them . but in the
bree - land [???] at any rate [???] the [???] were decent and prosperous [???] and no more
rustic tha n most of their distant [???] inside . it was not yet forgotten
that there had been a time when there was much coming and going between
the
shire and bree . there was bree - blood in the [???] by all accounts .
the village of bree had some hundred stone houses of the big folk [???]
mostly above the road [???] nestling on the hillside with windows looking west .
on that side [???] running in more than half a circle from the hill and back to
it [???] there was a deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side . over this
the road crossed by a causeway ; but where it pierced the hedge it was barred
by a great gate . there was another gate in the southern comer where the road
ran out of the village . the gates were closed at nightfall ; but just inside
them were small lodges for the [???] .
down on the road [???] where it swept to the right to go round the foot of
the hill [???] there was a large inn . it had been built long ago when the traffic
on the roads had been far greater . for bree stood at an old meeting of ways ;
another ancient road crossed the east road just outside ( he dike at the
western end of the village [???] and in former days men and other folk of various
sorts had travelled much on it . strange as news from bree was still a saying

in the [???] [???] descending from those days [???] when news from north [???]
south [???] and east could be heard in the inn [???] and when the shire - [???] used
to go more often to hear it . but the northern lands had long been desolate [???]
and the north road was now seldom used : it was grass - grown [???] and the
bree - folk called it the greenway .
the inn of bree was still there [???] however [???] and the [???] was an
important person . his house was a meeting place for the idle [???] talkative [???] and
[???] among the inhabitants [???] large and small [???] of the four villages ;
and a resort of rangers and other wanderers [???] and for such travellers ( mostly
[???] ) as still journeyed on the east road [???] to and from the mountains .
it was dark [???] and white stars were shining [???] when [???] and his
companions came at last to the greenway - crossing and drew near the village .
they came to the west - gate and found it shut [???] but at the door of the lodge
beyond it [???] there was a man sitting . he jumped up and fetched a lantern and
looked over the gate at them in surprise .
' what do you want [???] and where do you come from ? ' he asked [???] .
' we are making for the inn here [???] ' answered [???] . ' we are journeying
east and cannot go further tonight . '
' [???] ! four [???] ! and what ' s more [???] out of the shire by their
talk [???] ' said the [???] [???] softly as if speaking to himself . he stared at
them darkly for a moment [???] and then slowly opened the gate and let them ride
through .
' we don ' t often see shire - folk riding on the road at night [???] ' he went
on [???] as they halted a moment by his door . ' you ' ll pardon my wondering what
business takes you away east of bree ! what may your names be [???] might i ask ? '
' our names and our business are our own [???] and this does not seem a good
place to discuss them [???] ' said [???] [???] not liking the look of the man or the
tone of his voice .
' your business is your own [???] no doubt [???] ' said the man ; ' but it ' s my
business to ask questions after nightfall . '
' we are [???] from buckland [???] and we have a fancy to travel and to
stay at the inn here [???] ' put in merry . ' i am mr . [???] . is that enough
for you ? the bree - folk used to be fair - spoken to travellers [???] or so i had
heard . '
' all right [???] all right ! ' said the man . ' i meant no offence . but you ' ll
find maybe that more folk than old harry at the gate will be asking you
questions . there ' s queer folk about . if you go on to the pony [???] you ' ll find

you ' re oat the only guests . '
he wished them good night [???] and they said no more ; but [???] could see
in the lantern - light that the man was still eyeing them curiously . he was
glad to hear the gate clang to behind them [???] as they rode forward . he
wondered why the man was so suspicious [???] and whether any one had been
asking
for news of a party of [???] . could it have been [???] ? he might have
arrived [???] while they were delayed in the forest and the downs . but there was
something in the look and the voice of the [???] that made him uneasy .
the man stared after the [???] for a moment [???] and then he went back to
his house . as soon as his back was turned [???] a dark figure climbed quickly in
over the gate and melted into the shadows of the village street .
the [???] rode on up a gentle slope [???] passing a few detached houses [???]
and drew up outside the inn . the houses looked large and strange to them .
sam stared up at the inn with its three storeys and many windows [???] and felt
his heart sink . he had imagined himself meeting giants taller than trees [???]
and other creatures even more terrifying [???] some time or other in the course
of his journey ; but at the moment he was finding his first sight of men and
their tall houses quite enough [???] indeed too much for the dark end of a tiring
day . he pictured black horses standing all saddled in the shadows of the
inn - yard [???] and black riders peering out of dark upper windows .
' we surely aren ' t going to stay here for the night [???] are we [???] sir ? ' he
exclaimed . ' if there are hobbit - folk in these pans [???] why don ' t we look for
some that would be willing to take us in ? it would be more homelike . '
' what ' s wrong with the inn ? ' said [???] . ' tom [???] recommended it .
i expect it ' s homelike enough inside . '
even from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar eyes .
it had a front on the road [???] and two wings running back on land partly cut
out of the lower [???] of the hill [???] so that at the rear the second - floor
windows were level with the ground . there was a wide arch leading to a
courtyard between the two wings [???] and on the left under the arch there was a
large doorway reached by a few broad steps . the door was open and light
streamed out of it . above the arch there was a lamp [???] and beneath it swung a
large signboard : a fat white pony reared up on its hind legs . over the door
was painted in white letters : the prancing pony by [???]
[???] . many
of the lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains .

as they [???] outside in the gloom [???] someone began singing a merry
song inside [???] and many cheerful voices joined loudly in the chorus . they
listened to this encouraging sound for a moment and then got off their
[???] . the song ended and there was a burst of laughter and clapping .
they led their [???] under the arch [???] and leaving them standing in the
yard they climbed up the steps . [???] went forward and nearly [???] into a
short fat man with a bald head and a red face . he had a white apron on [???] and
was bustling out of one door and in through another [???] carrying a tray laden
with full mugs .
' can we - - ' began [???] .
' half a minute [???] if you please ! ' shouted the man over his shoulder [???] and
vanished into a babel of voices and a cloud of smoke . in a moment he was out
again [???] wiping his hands on his apron .
' good evening [???] little master ! ' he said [???] bending down . ' what may you be
wanting ? '
' beds for four [???] and stabling for five [???] [???] if that can be managed .
are you mr . [???] ? '
' that ' s right ! [???] is my name . [???] [???] at your service !
you ' re from the shire [???] eh ? ' he said [???] and then suddenly he clapped his hand
to his forehead [???] as if trying to remember something . ' [???] ! ' he cried .
' now what does that remind me of ? might i ask your names [???] sir ? '
' mr . took and mr . [???] [???] ' said [???] ; ' and this is sam [???] . my
name is [???] . '
' there now ! ' said mr . [???] [???] snapping his fingers . ' it ' s gone
again ! but it ' ll come back [???] when i have time to think . i ' m run off my feet ;
but i ' ll see what i can do for you . we don ' t often get a party out of the
shire [???] [???] and i should be sorry not to make you welcome . but there is
such a crowd already in the house tonight as there hasn ' t been for long
enough . it never rains but it pours [???] we say in bree .
' hi ! nob ! ' he shouted . ' where are you [???] you woolly - footed slow - coach ?
nob ! '
' coming [???] sir ! coming ! ' a cheery - looking hobbit [???] out of a door [???]
and seeing the travellers [???] stopped short and stared at them with great
interest .
' where ' s bob ? ' asked the landlord . ' you don ' t know ? well find him !
double sharp ! i haven ' t got six legs [???] nor six eyes neither ! tell bob there ' s
five [???] that have to be stabled . he must find room somehow . ' nob trotted

off with a grin and a wink .
' well [???] now [???] what wa s i going to say ? ' said mr . [???] [???] tapping his
forehead . ' one thing drives out another [???] so to speak . i ' m that busy tonight [???]
my head is going round . there ' s a party that came up the greenway from
down
south last night - and that was strange enough to begin with . then there ' s a
travelling company of [???] going west come in this evening . and now
there ' s you . if you weren ' t [???] [???] i doubt if we could house you . but
we ' ve got a room or two in the north wing that were made special for
[???] [???] when this place was built . on the ground floor as they usually
prefer ; round windows and all as they like it . i hope you ' ll be comfortable .
you ' ll be wanting supper [???] i don ' t doubt . as soon as may be . this way now ! '
he led them a short way down a passage [???] and opened a door . ' here is a
nice little parlour ! ' he said . ' i hope it will suit . excuse me now . i ' m that
busy . no time for talking . i must be trotting . it ' s hard work for two legs [???]
but i don ' t get thinner . i ' ll look in again la ter . if you want anything [???]
ring the hand - bell [???] and nob will come . if he don ' t come [???] ring and shout ! '
off he went at last [???] and left them feeling rather breathless . he seemed
capable of an endless stream of talk [???] however busy he might be . they found
themselves in a small and cosy room . there was a bit of bright fire burning
on the hearth [???] and in front of it were some low and comfortable chairs .
there was a round table [???] already spread with a white cloth [???] and on it was a
large hand - bell . but nob [???] the hobbit servant [???] came bustling in long before
they thought of ringing . he brought candles and a tray full of plates .
' will you be wanting anything to drink [???] masters ? ' he asked . ' and shall
i show you the bedrooms [???] while your supper is got ready ? '
they were washed and in the middle of good deep mugs of beer when mr .
[???] and nob came in again . in a [???] the table was laid . there
was hot soup [???] cold meats [???] a blackberry tart [???] new loaves [???] [???] of butter [???]
and half a ripe cheese : good plain food [???] as good as the shire could show [???]
and homelike enough to dispel the last of sam ' s [???] ( already much
relieved by the excellence of the beer ) .
the landlord hovered round for a link [???] and then prepared to leave them .
' i don ' t know whether you would care to join the company [???] when you have
supped [???] ' he said [???] standing at the door . ' perhaps you would rather go to your
beds . still the company would be very pleased to welcome you [???] if you had a
mind . we don ' t get [???] - travellers from the shire [???] i should say [???]

begging your pardon - often ; and we like to hear a bit of news [???] or any story
or song you may have in mind . but as you please ! ring the bell [???] if you lack
anything ! '
so refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the end of their supper
( about three quarters of an hour ' s steady going [???] not hindered by unnecessary
talk ) that [???] [???] [???] [???] and sam decided to join the company . merry said it
would be too stuffy . ' i shall sit here quietly by the fire for a bit [???] and
perhaps go out later for a sniff of the air . mind your ps and qs [???] and don ' t
forget that you are supposed to be escaping in secret [???] and are still on the
high - road and not very far from the shire ! '
' all right ! ' said [???] . ' mind yourself ! don ' t get lost [???] and don ' t
forget that it is safer [???] ! '
the company was in the big common - room of the inn . the gathering was
large and mixed [???] as [???] discovered [???] when his eyes got used to the light .
this came chiefly from a blazing log - fire [???] for the three lamps hanging from
the beams were dim [???] and half veiled in smoke . [???] [???] was
standing near the fire [???] talking to a couple of [???] and one or two
strange - looking men . on the benches were various folk : men of bree [???] a
collection of local [???] ( sitting chattering together ) [???] a few more
[???] [???] and other vague figures difficult to make out away in the shadows
and comers .
as soon as the shire - [???] entered [???] there was a chorus of welcome
from the bree - landers . the strangers [???] especially those that had come up the
greenway [???] stared at them curiously . the landlord introduced the [???] to
the bree - folk [???] so quickly that [???] though they caught many names [???] they were
seldom sure who the names belonged to . the men of bree seemed all to have
rather [???] ( and to the shire - folk rather odd ) names [???] like rushlight [???]
[???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] and ferny ( not to mention
[???] ) . some of the [???] had similar names . the [???] [???] for
instance [???] seemed [???] . but most of them had natural names [???] such as
banks [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] and [???] [???] many of which
were
used in the shire . there were several [???] from saddle [???] and as they
could not imagine sharing a name without being related [???] they took [???] to
their hearts as a long - lost cousin .
the bree - [???] were [???] in fact [???] friendly and [???] [???] and [???]
soon found that some explanation of what he was doing would have to be

given . he gave out that he was interested in history and [???] ( at which
there was much wagging of heads [???] although neither of these words were much
used in the bree - dialect ) . he said he was thinking of writing a book ( at
which there was silent astonishment ) [???] and that he and his friends wanted to
collect information about [???] living outside the shire [???] especially in
the eastern lands .
at this a chorus of voices broke out . if [???] had really wanted to
write a book [???] and had had many ears [???] he would have learned enough for
several chapters in a few minutes . and if that was not enough [???] he was given
a whole list of names [???] beginning with ' old [???] here ' [???] to whom he could
go for further information . but after a time [???] a s [???] did not show any sign
of writing a book on the spot [???] the [???] returned to their questions about
doings in the shire . [???] did not prove very communicative [???] and he soon
found himself sitting alone in a comer [???] listening and looking around .
the men and [???] were mostly talking of distant events and telling
flews of a kind that was becoming only too familiar . there was trouble away
in the south [???] and it seemed that the men who had come up the greenway
were
on the move [???] looking for lands where they could find some peace . the
bree - folk were sympathetic [???] but plainly not very ready to take a large
number of strangers into their little land . one of the travellers [???] a
squint - eyed ill - favoured fellow [???] was [???] that more and more people
would be coming north in the near future . ' if room isn ' t found for them [???]
they ' ll find it for themselves . they ' ve a right to live [???] same as other
folk [???] ' he said loudly . the local inhabitants did not look pleased at the
prospect .
the [???] did not pay much attention to all this [???] and it did not at
the moment seem to concern [???] . big folk could hardly beg for lodgings
in hobbit - holes . they were more interested in sam and [???] [???] who were now
feeling quite at home [???] and were chatting gaily about events in the shire .
[???] roused a good deal of laughter with an account of the [???] of the
roof of the town hole in michel delving : will whitfoot [???] the mayor [???] and the
[???] hobbit in the [???] [???] had been buried in chalk [???] and came out
like a floured [???] . but there were several questions asked that made
[???] a little uneasy . one of the bree - landers [???] who seemed to have been in
the shire several times [???] wanted to know where the [???] lived and who
they were related to .

suddenly [???] noticed that a strange - looking weather - beaten man [???]
sitting in the shadows near the wall [???] was also listening intently to the
hobbit - talk . he had a tall [???] in front of him [???] and was smoking a
long - [???] pipe curiously carved . his legs were stretched out before him [???]
showing high boots of supple leather that fitted him well [???] but had seen much
wear and were now caked with mud . a travel - stained cloak of heavy dark -
green
cloth was drawn close about him [???] and in spite of the heat of the room he
wore a hood that [???] his face ; but the gleam of his eyes could be
seen as he watched the [???] .
' who is that ? ' [???] asked [???] when he got a chance to whisper to mr .
[???] . ' i don ' t think you introduced him ? '
' him ? ' said the landlord in an answering whisper [???] cocking an eye
without turning his head . ' i don ' t rightly know . he is one of the wandering
folk - rangers we call them . he seldom talks : not but what he can tell a rare
tale when he has the mind . he disappears for a month [???] or a year [???] and then he
pops up again . he was in and out pretty often last spring ; but i haven ' t
seen him about lately . what his right name is i ' ve never heard : but he ' s
known round here as strider . goes about at a great pace on his long shanks ;
though he don ' t tell nobody what cause he has to hurry . but there ' s no
accounting for east and west [???] as we say in bree [???] meaning the rangers and the
shire - folk [???] begging your pardon . funny you should ask about him . ' but at
that moment mr . [???] was called away by a demand for more ale and his
last remark remained [???] .
[???] found that strider was now looking at him [???] as if he had heard or
guessed all that had been said . presently [???] with a wave of his hand and a
nod [???] he invited [???] to come over and sit by him . as [???] drew near be
threw back his hood [???] showing a [???] head of dark hair necked with grey [???]
and in a pale stem face a pair of keen grey eyes .
' i am called strider [???] ' he said in a low voice . ' i am very pleased to
meet you . master - [???] [???] if old [???] got your name right . '
' he did [???] ' said [???] stiffly . he felt far from comfortable under the
stare of those keen eyes .
' well [???] master [???] [???] ' said strider [???] ' if i were you [???] i should stop
your young friends from talking too much . drink [???] fire [???] and chance - meeting
are pleasant enough [???] but [???] well - this isn ' t the shire . there are queer folk
about . though i say it as shouldn ' t [???] you may think [???] ' he added with a wry

smile [???] seeing [???] ' s glance . ' and there have been even stranger travellers
through bree lately [???] ' he went on [???] watching [???] ' s face .
[???] returned his gaze but said nothing ; and strider made no further
sign . his attention seemed suddenly to be fixed on [???] . to his alarm
[???] became aware that the ridiculous young took [???] encouraged by his success
with the fat mayor of michel delving [???] was now actually giving a comic
account of [???] ' s farewell party . he was already giving an imitation of the
speech [???] and was drawing near to the astonishing [???] .
[???] was annoyed . it was a harmless enough tale for most of the local
[???] [???] no doubt : just a funny story about those funny people away beyond
the river ; but some ( old [???] [???] for instance ) knew a thing or two [???] and
had probably heard rumours long ago about [???] ' s vanishing . it would bring
the name of [???] to their minds [???] especially if there had been [???]
in bree after that name .
[???] [???] [???] wondering what to do . [???] was evidently much
enjoying the attention he was getting [???] and had become quite forgetful of
their danger . [???] had a sudden fear that in his present mood he might even
mention the ring ; and that might well be [???] .
' you had better do something quick ! ' whispered strider in his ear .
[???] jumped up and stood on a table [???] and began to talk . the attention
of [???] ' s audience was disturbed . some of the [???] looked at [???] and
laughed and clapped [???] thinking that mr . [???] had taken as much ale as
was good for him .
[???] suddenly felt very foolish [???] and found himself ( as was his habit
when making a speech ) fingering the things in his pocket . he felt the ring
on its chain [???] and quite [???] the desire came over him to slip it on
and vanish out of the silly situation . it seemed to him [???] somehow [???] as if me
suggestion came to him from outside [???] from someone or something a the room .
he resisted the temptation firmly [???] and clasped the ring in his hand [???] as if
to keep a hold on it and prevent it from escaping or doing any mischief . at
any rate it gave him no [???] . he spoke ' a few suitable words ' [???] as
they would have said in the shire : we are all very much gratified by the
kindness of your reception [???] and i venture to hope that my brief visit will
help to renew the old ties of friendship between the shire and bree ; and
then he [???] and coughed .
everyone in the room was now looking at him . ' a song ! ' shouted one of
the [???] . ' a song ! a song ! ' shouted all the others . ' come on now [???] master [???]

sing us something that we haven ' t heard before ! '
for a moment [???] stood gaping . then in desperation he began a
ridiculous song tha t [???] had been rather fond of ( and indeed rather proud
of [???] for he had made up the words himself ) . it was about an inn ; and that is
probably why it came into [???] ' s mind just then . here it is in full . only a
few words of it are now [???] as a rule [???] remember ed .
there is an inn [???] a merry old inn
beneath an old grey hill [???]
and there they brew a beer so brown
that the man in the moon himself came down
one night to drink his fill .

the ostler has a [???] cat
that plays a five - stringed fiddle ;
and up and down he runs his bow [???]
now squeaking high [???] now purring low [???]
now sawing in the middle .

the landlord keeps a little dog
that is mighty fond of jokes ;
when there ' s good cheer among the guests [???]
he cocks an ear at all the jests
and laughs until he chokes .

they also keep a horned cow
as proud as any queen ;
but music turns her head like ale [???]
and makes her wave her [???] tail
and dance upon the green .

and o ! the rows of silver dishes
and the store of silver spoons !
for sunday * there ' s a special pair [???]
and these they polish up with care
on [???] afternoons .

the man in the moon was drinking deep [???]

and the cat began to wail ;
a dish and a spoon on the table danced [???]
the cow in the garden madly pranced [???]
and the little dog chased his tail .

the man in the moon took another mug [???]
and then rolled beneath his chair ;
and there he dozed and dreamed of ale [???]
till in the sky the stars were pale [???]
and dawn was in the air .

then the ostler said to his [???] cat :
' the white horses of the moon [???]
they neigh and champ their silver bits ;
but their master ' s been and drowned his wits [???]
and the sun ' ll be rising soon ! '

so the cat on his fiddle played hey - diddle - diddle [???]
a jig that would wake the dead :
he squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune [???]
while the landlord shook the man in the moon :
' it ' s after three ! ' he said .

they rolled the man slowly up the hill
and bundled him into the moon [???]
while his horses [???] up in rear [???]
and the cow came capering like a deer [???]
and a dish ran up with the spoon .

now quicker the fiddle went deedle - dum - diddle ;
the dog began to roar [???]
the cow and the horses stood on their heads ;
the guests all bounded from their beds
and danced upon the floor .

with a ping and a pong the fiddle - strings broke !
the cow jumped over the moon [???]

and the little dog laughed to see such fun [???]
and the [???] dish went off at a run
with the silver sunday spoon .

the round moon rolled behind the hill
as the sun raised up her head .
she * hardly believed her fiery eyes ;
for though it was day [???] to her surprise
they all went back to bed !
there was loud and long applause . [???] had a good voice [???] and the song
tickled their fancy . ' where ' s old barley ? ' they cried . ' he ought to hear
this . bob ought to learn his cat the fiddle [???] and then we ' d have a dance . '
they called for more ale [???] and began to shout : ' let ' s have it again [???] master !
come on now ! once more ! '
they made [???] have another drink [???] and then begin his song again [???]
while many of them joined in ; for the tune was well known [???] and they were
quick at picking up words . it was now [???] ' s turn to feel pleased with
himself . he capered about on the table ; and when he came a second time to
the cow jumped over the moon [???] he leaped in the air . much too [???] ; for
he came down [???] bang [???] into a tray full of mugs [???] and slipped [???] and rolled off
the table with a crash [???] clatter [???] and bump ! the audience all opened their
mouths wide for laughter [???] and stopped short a gaping silence ; for the singer
disappeared . he simply vanished [???] as if he had gone slap through the floor
without leaving a hole !
the local [???] stared in amazement [???] and then sprang to their feet
and shouted for [???] . all the company drew away from [???] and sam [???]
who
found themselves left alone in a comer [???] and eyed darkly and doubtfully from
a distance . it was plain that many people regarded them now as the
companions of a travelling magician of unknown powers and purpose . but
there
was one [???] bree - lander [???] who stood looking at them with a knowing and
half - mocking expression that made them feel very uncomfortable . presently he
slipped out of the door [???] followed by the squint - eyed [???] : the two had
been whispering together a good deal during the evening . harry the
[???] also went out just behind them . .
[???] felt a fool . not knowing what else to do [???] he [???] away under

the tables to the dark comer by strider [???] who sat [???] [???] giving no sign of
his thoughts . [???] leaned back against the wall and took off the ring . how
it came to be on his finger he could not tell . he could only suppose that he
had been handling it in his pocket while he sang [???] and that somehow it had
slipped on when he stuck out his hand with a jerk to save his fall . for a
moment he wondered if the ring itself had not played him a trick ; perhaps it
had tried to reveal itself in response to some wish or command that was felt
in the room . he did not like the looks of the men that had gone out .
' well ? ' said strider [???] when he rea [???] . ' why did you do that ? worse
than anything your friends could have said ! you have put your foot in it ! or
should i say your finger ? '
' i don ' t know what you mean [???] ' said [???] [???] annoyed and alarmed .
' oh yes [???] you do [???] ' answered strider ; ' but we had better wait until the
[???] has died down . then [???] if you please [???] mr . [???] [???] i should like a
quiet word with you . '
' what about ? ' asked [???] [???] ignoring the sudden use of his proper name .
' a matter of some importance - to us both [???] ' answered strider [???] looking
[???] in the eye . ' you may hear something to your advantage . '
' very well [???] ' said [???] [???] trying to appear [???] . ' i ' ll talk to
you later . '
meanwhile an argument was going on by the [???] . mr . [???] had
come trotting in [???] and he was now trying to listen to several conflicting
accounts of the event at the same time .
' i saw him [???] mr . [???] [???] ' said a hobbit ; ' or leastways i didn ' t see
him [???] if you take my meaning . he just vanished into thin air [???] in a manner of
speaking . '
' you don ' t say [???] mr . [???] ! ' said the landlord [???] looking puzzled .
' yes i do ! ' replied [???] . ' and i mean what i say [???] what ' s more . '
' there ' s some mistake somewhere [???] ' said [???] [???] shaking his head .
there was too much of that mr . [???] to go vanishing into thin air ; or
into thick air [???] as is more likely in this room . '
' well [???] where is he now ? ' cried several voices .
' how should i know ? he ' s welcome to go where he will [???] so long as he
pays in the morning . there ' s mr . took [???] now : he ' s not vanished . '
' well [???] i saw what i saw [???] and i saw what i didn ' t [???] ' said [???]
[???] .
' and i say there ' s some mistake [???] ' repeated [???] [???] picking up the

tray and gathering up the broken [???] .
' of course there ' s a mistake ! ' said [???] . ' i haven ' t vanished . here i
am ! i ' ve just been having a few words with strider in the comer . '
he came forward into the firelight ; but most of the company backed
away [???] [???] even more [???] than before . they were not in the least satisfied
by his explanation that he had [???] away quickly under the tables after
he had fallen . most of the [???] and the men of bree went off then and
there in a huff [???] having no fancy for further entertainment that evening . one
or two gave [???] a black look and departed muttering among themselves .
the
[???] and the two or three strange men that still remained got up and said
good night to the landlord [???] but not to [???] and his friends . before long no
one was left but strider [???] who sat on [???] [???] [???] by the wall .
mr . [???] did not seem much put out . he reckoned [???] very probably [???]
that his house would be full again on many future nights [???] until the present
mystery had been thoroughly discussed . ' n ow what have you been doing [???] mr .
[???] ? ' he asked . ' frightening my customers and breaking up my crocks
with your [???] ! '
' i am very sorry to have caused any trouble [???] ' said [???] . ' it was quite
[???] [???] i assure you . a most unfortunate accident . '
' all right [???] mr . [???] ! but if you ' re going to do any more tumbling [???]
or conjuring [???] or whatever it was [???] you ' d best warn folk beforehand - and warn
me . we ' re a bit suspicious round here of anything out of the way - uncanny [???]
if you understand me ; and we don ' t take to it all of a sudden . '
' i shan ' t be doing anything of the sort again [???] mr . [???] [???] i promise
you . and now i think i ' ll be getting to bed . we shall be making an early
start . will you see that our [???] are ready by eight o ' clock ? '
' very good ! but before you go [???] i should like a word with you in
private [???] mr . [???] . something has just come back to my mind that i ought
to tell you . i hope that you ' ll not take it amiss . when i ' ve seen to a thing
or two [???] i ' ll come along to your room [???] if you ' re willing . '
' certainly ! ' said [???] ; but his heart sank . he wondered how many
private talks he would have before he got to bed [???] and what they would
reveal . were these people all in league against him ? he began to suspect
even old [???] ' s fat face of concealing dark designs .



[???] h4 [???] chapter 10 [???] [???] h4 [???] . strider



[???] [???] [???] [???] and sam made their way back to the parlour . there was no
light . merry was not there [???] and the fire had burned low . it was not until
they had puffed up the embers into a blaze and thrown on a couple of [???]
that they discovered strider had come with them . there he was calmly sitting
in a chair by the door !
' hallo ! ' said [???] . ' who are you [???] and what do you want ? '
' i am called strider [???] ' he answered : ' and though he may have forgotten
it [???] your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me . '
' you said i might hear something to my advantage [???] i believe [???] ' said
[???] . ' what have you to say ? '
' several things [???] ' a [???] strider . ' but [???] of course [???] i have my price . '
' what do you mean ? ' asked [???] sharply .
' don ' t be alarmed ! i mean just this : i will tell you what i know [???] and
give you some good advice - but i shall want a reward . '
' and what will that be [???] pray ? ' said [???] . he suspected now that he had
fallen in with a rascal [???] and he thought uncomfortably that he had brought
only a little money with him . all of it would hardly satisfy a rogue [???] and he
could not spare any of it .
' no more than you can afford [???] ' answered strider with a slow smile [???] as
if he guessed [???] ' s thoughts . ' just this : you must take me along with you [???]
until i wish to leave you . '
' oh [???] indeed ! ' replied [???] [???] surprised [???] but not much relieved . ' even if
i wanted another companion [???] i should not agree to any such thing [???] until i
knew a good deal more about you [???] and your business . '
' excellent ! ' exclaimed strider [???] crossing his legs and sitting back
comfortably . ' you seem to be coming to your senses again [???] and that is all to
the good . you have been much too careless so far . very well ! i will tell you
what i know [???] and leave the reward to you . you may be glad to grant it [???] when
you have heard me . '
' go on then ! ' said [???] . ' what do you know ? '
' too much ; too many dark things [???] ' said strider grimly . ' but as for your
business - - ' he got up and went to the door [???] opened it quickly and looked
out . then he shut it quietly and sat down again . ' i have quick ears [???] ' he
went on [???] lowering his voice [???] ' and though i cannot disappear [???] i have hunted

many wild and wary things and i can usually avoid being seen [???] if i wish .
now [???] i was behind the hedge this evening on the road west of bree [???] when four
[???] came out of the [???] . i need not repeat all that they said to
old [???] or to one another [???] but one thing interested me . please
remember [???] said one of them [???] that the name [???] must not be mentioned . i
am mr . [???] [???] if any name must be given . that interested me so much that
i followed them here . i slipped over the gate just behind them . maybe mr .
[???] has an honest reason for leaving his name behind ; but if so [???] i
should advise him and his friends to be more careful . '
' i don ' t see what interest my name has for any one in bree [???] ' sa id [???]
angrily [???] ' and i have still to learn why it interests you . mr . strider may
have an honest reason for spying and [???] ; but if so [???] i should
advise him to explain it . '
' well answered ! ' said strider laughing . ' but the explanation is simple :
i was looking for a hobbit called [???] [???] . i wanted to find him
quickly . i had learned that he was carrying out of the shire [???] well [???] a secret
that concerned me and my friends .
' now [???] don ' t mistake me ! ' he cried [???] as [???] rose from his seat [???] and sam
jumped up with a [???] . ' i shall take more care of the secret than you do .
and care is needed ! ' he leaned forward and looked at them . ' watch every
shadow ! ' he said in a low voice . ' black horsemen have passed through bree .
on monday one came down the greenway [???] they say ; and another appeared
later [???]
coming up the greenway from the south . '
there was a silence . at last [???] spoke to [???] and sam : ' i ought to
have guessed it from the way the [???] greeted us [???] ' he said . ' and the
landlord seems to have heard something . why did he press us to join the
company ? and why on earth did we behave so foolishly : we ought to have
stayed quiet in here . '
' it would have been better [???] ' said strider . ' i would have stopped your
going into the common - room [???] if i could ; but the [???] would not let me
in to see you [???] or take a message . '
' do you think he - - - - - - ' began [???] .
' no [???] i don ' t think any harm of old [???] . only he does not
altogether like mysterious [???] of my sort . ' [???] gave him a puzzled
look . ' well [???] i have rather a rascally look [???] have i not ? ' said strider with a
curl of his lip and a queer gleam in his eye . ' but i hope we shall get to

know one another better . when we do [???] i hope you will explain what happened
at the end of your song . for that little prank - - - - - - '
' it was sheer accident ! ' interrupted [???] .
' i wonder [???] ' said strider . ' accident [???] then . that accident has made your
position dangerous . '
' hardly more than it was already [???] ' said [???] . ' i knew these horsemen
were pursuing me ; but now at any rate they seem to have missed me and to
have gone away . '
' you must not count on that ! ' said strider sharply . ' they will return .
and more are coming . there are others . i know their number . i know these
riders . ' he paused [???] and his eyes were cold and hard . ' and there are some
folk in bree who are not to be trusted [???] ' he went on . ' bill ferny [???] for
instance . he has an evil name in the bree - land [???] and queer folk call at his
house . you must have noticed him among the company : a [???] sneering
fellow . he was very close with one of the southern strangers [???] and they
slipped out together just after your [???] accident [???] . not all of those
[???] mean well ; and as for ferny [???] he would sell anything to anybody ;
or make mischief for [???] . '
' what will ferny sell [???] and what has my accident got to do with him ? '
said [???] [???] still determined not to understand strider ' s hints .
' news of you [???] of course [???] ' answered strider . ' an account of your
performance would be very interesting to certain people . after that they
would hardly need to be told your real name . it seems to me only too likely
that they will hear of it befor e this night is over . is that enough ? you can
do as you like about my reward : take me as a guide or not . but i may say
that i know all the lands between the shire and the misty mountains [???] for i
have wandered over them for many years . i am older than i look . i might
prove useful . you will have to leave the open road after tonight ; for the
horsemen will watch it night and day . you may escape from bree [???] and be
allowed to go forward while the sun is up ; but you won ' t go far . they will
come on you in the wild [???] in some dark place where there is no help . do you
wish them to find you ? they are terrible ! '
the [???] looked at him [???] and saw with surprise that his face was
drawn as if with pain [???] and his hands [???] the arms of his chair . the
room was very quiet and still [???] and the light seemed to have grown dim . for a
while he sat with [???] eyes as if walking in distant memory or listening
to sounds in the night far away .

' there ! ' he cried after a moment [???] drawing his hand across his brow .
' perhaps i know more about these pursuers than you do . you fear them [???] but
you do not fear them enough [???] yet . tomorrow you will have to escape [???] if you
can . strider can take you by paths that are seldom trodden . will you have
him ? '
there was a heavy silence . [???] made no answer [???] his mind was confused
with doubt and fear . sam frowned [???] and looked at his master ; and at last he
broke out :
' with your leave [???] mr . [???] [???] i ' d say no ! this strider here [???] he warns
and he says take care ; and i say yes to that [???] and let ' s begin with him . he
comes out of the wild [???] and i never heard no good of such folk . he knows
something [???] that ' s plain [???] and more than i like ; but it ' s no reason why we
should let him go leading us out into some dark place far from help [???] as he
puts it . '
[???] [???] and looked uncomfortable . strider did not reply to sam [???]
but turned his keen eyes on [???] . [???] caught his glance and looked away .
' no [???] ' he said slowly . ' i don ' t agree . i think [???] i think you are not really as
you choose to look . you began to talk to me like the bree - folk [???] but your
voice has changed . still sam seems right in this : i don ' t see why you should
warn us to take care [???] and yet ask us to take you on trust . why the disguise ?
who are you ? what do you really know about - about my business ; and how
do
you know it ? '
' the lesson in caution has been well learned [???] ' said strider with a grim
smile . ' but caution is one thing and wavering is another . you will never get
to [???] ll now on your own [???] and to trust me is your only chance . you must
make up your mind . i will answer some of your questions [???] if that will help
you to do so . but why should you believe my story [???] if you do not trust me
already ? still here it is - - - - - - '
at that moment there came a knock at the door . mr . [???] had
arrived with candles [???] and behind him was nob with cans of hot water . strider
withdrew into a dark corner .
' i ' ve come to bid you good night [???] ' said the landlord [???] putting the
candles on the table . ' nob ! take the water to the rooms ! ' he came in and
shut the door .
' it ' s like this [???] ' he began [???] [???] and looking troubled . ' if i ' ve
done any harm [???] i ' m sorry indeed . but one thing drives out another [???] as you ' ll

admit ; and i ' m a busy man . but first one thing and then another this week
have jogged my memory [???] as the saying goes ; and not too late i hope . you see [???]
i was asked to look out for [???] of the shire [???] and for one by the name of
[???] in particular . '
' and what has that got to do with me ? ' asked [???] .
' ah ! you know best [???] ' said the landlord [???] knowingly . ' i won ' t give you
away ; but i was told that this [???] would be going by the name of
[???] [???] and i was given a description that fits you well enough [???] if i may
say so . '
' indeed ! let ' s have it then ! ' said [???] [???] [???] interrupting .
' a stout little fellow with red cheeks [???] ' said mr . [???] solemnly .
[???] [???] [???] but sam looked indignant . ' that won ' t help you much ; it
goes for most [???] . barley [???] he says to me [???] ' continued mr . [???] with
a glance at [???] . ' but this one is taller than some and fairer than most [???]
and he has a cleft in his chin : perky chap with a bright eye . begging your
pardon [???] but he said it [???] not me . '
' he said it ? and who was he ? ' asked [???] eagerly .
' ah ! that was [???] [???] if you know who i mean . a [???] they say he is [???]
but he ' s a good friend of mine [???] whether or no . but now i don ' t know what
he ' ll have to say to me [???] if i see him again : turn all my ale sour or me into
a block of wood [???] i shouldn ' t wonder . he ' s a bit hasty . still what ' s done
can ' t be undone . '
' well [???] what have you done ? ' said [???] [???] getting impatient with the slow
[???] of [???] ' s thoughts .
' where was i ? ' said the landlord [???] [???] and snapping his fingers .
' ah [???] yes ! old [???] . three months back he walked right into my room
without a knock . barley [???] he says [???] i ' m off in the morning . will you do
something for me ? you ' ve only to name it [???] i said . i ' m in a hurry [???] said he [???]
and i ' ve no time myself [???] but i want a message took to the shire . have you
anyone you can send [???] and trust to go ? i can find someone [???] i said [???] tomorrow [???]
maybe [???] or the day after . make it tomorrow [???] he says [???] and then he gave me a
letter .
' it ' s addressed plain enough [???] ' said mr . [???] [???] producing a letter
from his pocket [???] and reading out the address slowly and proudly ( he valued
his reputation as a lettered man ) :
mr [???] [???] [???] bag end [???] [???] in the shire .
' a letter for me from [???] ! ' cried [???] .

' ah ! ' said mr . [???] . ' then your right name is [???] ? '
' it is [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and you had better give me that letter at once [???]
and explain why you never sent it . that ' s what you came to tell me [???] i
suppose [???] though you ' ve taken a long time to come to the point . '
poor mr . [???] looked troubled . ' you ' re right [???] master [???] ' he said [???]
' and i beg your pardon . and i ' m mortal afraid of what [???] will say [???] if
harm comes of it . but i didn ' t keep it back a - purpose . i put it by safe .
then i couldn ' t find nobody willing to go to the shire next day [???] nor the day
after [???] and none of my own folk were to spare ; and then one thing after
another drove it out of my mind . i ' m a busy man . i ' ll do what i can to set
matters right [???] and if there ' s any help i can give [???] you ' ve only to name it .
' leaving the letter aside [???] i promised [???] no less . barley [???] he says
to me [???] this friend of mine from the shire [???] he may be coming out this way
before long [???] him and another . he ' ll be calling himself [???] . mind that !
but you need ask no questions . and if i ' m not with him [???] he may be in
trouble [???] and he may need help . do whatever you can for him [???] and i ' ll be
grateful [???] he says . and here you are [???] and trouble is not far off [???] seemingly . '
' what do you mean ? ' asked [???] .
' these black men [???] ' said the landlord lowering his voice . ' they ' re
looking for [???] [???] and if they mean well [???] then i ' m a hobbit . it was on
monday [???] and all the dogs were [???] and the geese screaming . uncanny [???]
i
called it . nob [???] he came and told me that two black men were at the door
asking for a hobbit called [???] . nob ' s hair was all stood on end . i bid
the black fellows be off [???] and [???] the door on them ; but they ' ve been
asking the same question all the way to archet [???] i hear . and that ranger [???]
strider [???] he ' s been asking questions [???] too . tried to get in here to see you [???]
before you ' d had bite or sup [???] he did . '
' he did ! ' said strider suddenly [???] coming forward into the light . ' and
much trouble would have been saved [???] if you had let him in [???] [???] . '
the landlord jumped with surprise . ' you ! ' he cried . ' you ' re always
popping up . what do you want now ? '
' he ' s here with my leave [???] ' said [???] . ' he came to offer me his help . '
' well [???] you know your own business [???] maybe [???] ' said mr . [???] [???] looking
suspiciously at strider . ' but if i was in your plight [???] i wouldn ' t take up
with a ranger . '
' then who would you take up with ? ' asked strider . ' a fat [???] who

only remembers his own name because people shout it at him all day ? they
cannot stay in the pony for ever [???] and they cannot go home . they have a long
road before them . will you go with them and keep the black men off ? '
' me ? leave bree ! i wouldn ' t do that for any money [???] ' said mr . [???] [???]
looking really scared . ' but why can ' t you stay here quiet for a bit [???] mr .
[???] ? what are all these queer goings on ? what are these black men
after [???] and where do they come from [???] i ' d like to know ? '
' i ' m sorry i can ' t explain it all [???] ' answered [???] . ' i am tired and
very worried [???] and it ' s a long tale . but if you mean to help me [???] i ought to
warn you that you will be in danger as long as i am in your house . these
black riders : i am not sure [???] but i think [???] i fear they come from - - - - - - '
' they come from [???] [???] ' said strider in a low voice . ' from [???] [???]
[???] [???] if that means anything to you . '
' save us ! ' cried mr . bu [???] turning pale ; the name evidently was
known to him . ' that is the worst news that has come to bree in my time . ' ' it
is [???] ' said [???] . ' are you still willing to help me ? ' ' i am [???] ' said mr .
[???] . ' more than ever . though i don ' t know what the likes of me can do
against [???] against - - - - - - ' he faltered .
' against the shadow in the east [???] ' said strider quietly . ' not much [???]
[???] [???] but every little helps . you can let mr . [???] stay here
tonight [???] as mr . [???] [???] and you can forget the name of [???] [???] till he
is far away . '
' i ' ll do that [???] ' said [???] . ' but they ' ll find out he ' s here without
help from me [???] i ' m afraid . it ' s a pity mr . [???] drew attention to himself
this evening [???] to say no more . the story of that mr . [???] ' s going off has
been heard before tonight in bree . even our nob has been doing some guessing
in his slow pate : and there are others in bree quicker in the [???] than he
is . '
' well [???] we can only hope the riders won ' t come back yet [???] ' said [???] .
' i hope not [???] indeed [???] ' said [???] . ' but [???] or no [???] [???] they
won ' t get in the pony so easy . don ' t you worry till the morning . nob ' ll say
no word . no black man shall pass my doors [???] while i can stand on my legs . me
and my folk ' ll keep watch tonight ; but you had best get some sleep [???] if you
can . '
' in any case we must be called at dawn [???] ' said [???] . ' we must get off
as early as possible . breakfast at six - thirty [???] please . '
' right ! i ' ll see to the orders [???] ' said the landlord . ' good night [???] mr .

[???] - [???] [???] i should say ! good night - now [???] bless me ! where ' s your
mr . [???] ? '
' i don ' t know [???] ' said [???] with sudden anxiety . they had forgotten all
about merry [???] and it was getting late . ' i am afraid he is out . he said
something about going for a breath of air . '
' well [???] you do want looking after and no mistake : your party might be on
a holiday ! ' said [???] . ' i must go and bar the doors quick [???] but i ' ll see
your friend is let in when he comes . i ' d better send nob to look for him .
good night to you all ! ' at last mr . [???] went out [???] with another
doubtful look at strider and a shake of his head . his [???] retreated
down the passage .
' well ? ' said strider . ' when are you going to open that letter ? ' [???]
looked carefully at the seal before he broke it . it seemed certainly to be
[???] ' s . inside [???] written in the [???] ' s strong but graceful script [???] was
the following message :
the prancing pony [???] bree . [???] ' s day [???] shire year [???] [???] .
dear [???] [???]
bad news has reached me here . i must go off at once . you had better
leave bag end soon [???] and get out of the shire before the end of july at
latest . i will return as soon as i can ; and i will follow you [???] if i find
that you are gone . leave a message for me here [???] if you pass through bree .
you can trust the landlord ( [???] ) . you may meet a friend of mine on the
road : a man [???] lean [???] dark [???] tall [???] by some called strider . he knows our business
and will help you . make for [???] . there i hope we may meet again . if i
do not come [???] [???] will advise you .
yours in haste
[???] .
ps . do not use it again [???] not far any reason whatever ! do not travel by
night !
pps . make sure that it is the real strider . there are many strange men
on the roads . his true name is [???] .
all that is gold does not glitter [???]
not all those who wander are lost ;
the old that is strong does not wither [???]
deep roots are not reached by the frost .
from the ashes a fire shall be woken [???]
a light from the shadows shall spring ;

renewed shall be blade that was broken [???]
the crownless again shall be king .


[???] . i hope [???] sends this promptly . a worthy man [???] but his
memory is like a lumber - roam : thing wanted always buried . if he forgets [???] i
shall roast him .
fare well !
[???] read the letter to himself [???] and then passed it to [???] and sam .
' really old [???] has made a mess of things ! ' he said . ' he deserves
roasting . if i had got this at once [???] we might all have been safe in
[???] by now . but what can have happened to [???] ? he writes as if he
was going into great danger . '
' he has been doing that for many years [???] ' said strider .
[???] turned and looked at him thoughtfully [???] wondering about [???] ' s
second [???] . ' why didn ' t you tell me that you were [???] ' s friend at
once ? ' he asked . ' it would have saved time . '
' would it ? would any of you have believed me till now ? ' said strider .
' i knew nothing of this letter . for all i knew i had to persuade you to
trust me without proofs [???] if i was to help you . in any case [???] i did not intend
to tell you all about myself at once . i had to study you first [???] and make
sure of you . the enemy has set traps for me before now . as soon as i had
made up my mind [???] i was ready to tell you whatever you asked . but i must
admit [???] ' he added with a queer laugh [???] ' that i hoped you would take to me for
my own sake . a hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust a nd longs for
friendship . but there [???] i believe my looks are against me . '
' they are - at first sight at any rate [???] ' laughed [???] with sudden
relief after reading [???] ' s letter . ' but handsome is as handsome does [???] as
we say in the shire ; and i daresay we shall all look much the same after
lying for days in hedges and ditches . '
' it would take more than a few days [???] or weeks [???] or years [???] of wandering
in the wild to make you look like strider [???] ' he answered . ' and you would die
first [???] unless you are made of sterner stuff than you look to be . '
[???] [???] ; but sam was not [???] [???] and he still eyed strider
[???] . ' how do we know you are the strider that [???] speaks about ? '
he demanded . ' you never mentioned [???] [???] till this letter came out . you
might be a play - acting spy [???] for all i can see [???] trying to get us to go with

you . you might have done in the real strider and took his clothes . what have
you to say to that ? '
' that you are a stout fellow [???] ' answered strider ; ' but i am afraid my
only answer to you [???] sam [???] [???] is this . if i had killed the real strider [???] i
could kill you . and i should have killed you already without so much talk .
if i was after the ring [???] i could have it - now ! '
he stood up [???] and seemed suddenly to grow taller . in his eyes gleamed a
light [???] keen and commanding . throwing back his cloak [???] he laid his hand on the
hilt of a sword that had hung concealed by his side . they did not dare to
move . sam sat wide - mouthed staring at him dumbly .
' but i am the real strider [???] fortunately [???] ' he said [???] looking down at them
with his face softened by a sudden smile . ' i am [???] son of [???] ; and
if by life or death i can save you [???] i will . '
there was a long silence . at last [???] spoke with hesitation . ' i
believed that you were a friend before the letter came [???] ' he said [???] ' or at
least i wished to . you have frightened me several times tonight [???] but never
in the way that servants of the enemy would [???] or so i imagine . i think one of
his spies would - well [???] seem fairer and feel fouler [???] if you understand . '
' i see [???] ' laughed strider . ' i look foul and feel fair . is that it ? all
that is gold does not glitter [???] not all those who wander are lost . '
' did the verses apply to you then ? ' asked [???] . ' i could not make out
what they were about . but how did you know that they were in [???] ' s
letter [???] if you have never seen it ? '
' i did not know [???] ' he answered . ' but i am [???] [???] and those verses go
with that name . ' he drew out his swor d [???] and they saw that the blade was
indeed broken a foot below the hilt . ' not much use is it [???] sam ? ' said
strider . ' but the time is near when it shall be forged anew . '
sam said nothing .
' well [???] ' said strider [???] ' with sam ' s permission we will call that settled .
strider shall be your guide . we shall have a rough road tomorrow . even if we
are allowed to leave bree [???] [???] we can hardly hope now to leave it
[???] . but i shall try to get lost as soon as possible . i know one or
two ways out of bree - land other than the main road . if once we shake off the
pursuit [???] i shall make for [???] . '
' [???] ? ' said sam . ' what ' s that ? '
' it is a hill [???] just to the north of the road [???] about half way from here
to [???] . it commands a wide view all round ; and there we shall have a

chance to look about us . [???] will make for that point [???] if he follows us .
after [???] our journey will become more difficult [???] and we shall have
to choose between various dangers . '
' when did you last see [???] ? ' asked [???] . ' do you know where he is [???]
or what he is doing ? '
strider looked grave . ' i do not know [???] ' he said . ' i came west with him
in the spring . i have often kept watch on the borders of the shire in the
last few years [???] when he was busy elsewhere . he seldom left it [???] . we
last met on the first of may : at sam ford down the [???] . he told me
that his business with you had gone well [???] and that you would be starting for
[???] in the last week of [???] . as i knew he was at your side [???] i
went away on a journey of my own . and that has proved ill ; for plainly some
news reached him [???] and i was not at hand to help .
' i am troubled [???] for the first time since i have known him . we should
have had messages [???] even if he could not come himself . when i returned [???] many
days ago [???] i heard the ill news . the tidings had gone far and wide that
[???] was missing and the horsemen had been seen . it was the elven - folk of
gildor that told me this ; and later they told me that you had left your
home ; but there was no news of your leaving buckland . i have been watching
the east road anxiously . '
' do you think the black riders have anything to do with it - with
[???] ' s absence [???] i mean ? ' asked [???] .
' i do not know of anything else that could have hindered him [???] except
the enemy himself [???] ' said strider . ' but do not give up hope ! [???] is
greater than you shire - folk know - as a rule you can only see his jokes and
toys . but this business of ours will be his greatest task . '
[???] yawned . ' i am sorry [???] ' he said [???] ' but i am dead tired . in spite of
all the danger and worry i must go to bed [???] or sleep where i sit . where is
that silly fellow [???] merry ? it would be the last straw [???] if we had to go out in
the dark to look for him . '
at that moment they heard a door slam ; then feet came running along the
passage . merry came in with a rush followed by nob . he shut the door
hastily [???] and leaned against it . he was out of breath . they stared at him in
alarm for a moment before he gasped : ' i have seen them [???] [???] ! i have seen
them ! black riders ! '
' black riders ! ' cried [???] . ' where ? '
' here . in the village . i stayed [???] for an hour . then as you did

not come back [???] i went out for a stroll . i had come back again and was
standing just outside the light of the lamp looking at the stars . suddenly i
shivered and felt that something horrible was creeping near : there was a son
of deeper shade among the shadows across the road [???] just beyond the edge of
the lamplight . it slid away at once into the dark without a sound . there was
no horse . '
' which way did it go ? ' asked strider [???] suddenly and sharply . merry
started [???] noticing the stranger for the first time . ' go on ! ' said [???] .
' this is a friend of [???] ' s . i will explain later . '
' it seemed to make off up the road [???] eastward [???] ' continued merry . ' i
tried to follow . of course [???] it vanished almost at once ; but i went round the
corner and on as far as the last house on the road . '
strider looked at merry with wonder . ' you have a stout heart [???] ' he said ;
' but it was foolish . '
' i don ' t know [???] ' said merry . ' neither brave nor silly [???] i think . i could
hardly help myself . i seemed to be drawn somehow . anyway [???] i went [???] and
suddenly i heard voices by the hedge . one was muttering ; and the other was
whispering [???] or hissing . i couldn ' t hear a word that was said . i did not
creep any closer [???] because i began to tremble all over . then i felt
terrified [???] and i turned back [???] and was just going to bolt home [???] when
something came behind me and i . . . i fell over . '
' i found him [???] sir [???] ' put in nob . ' mr . [???] sent me out with a
lantern . i went down to west - gate [???] and then back up towards south - gate . just
nigh bill ferny ' s house i thought i could see something in the road . i
couldn ' t swear to it [???] but it looked to me as if two men was stooping over
something [???] [???] it . i gave a shout [???] but where i got up to the spot there
was no signs of them [???] and only mr . [???] lying by the roadside . he
seemed to be asleep . [???] i thought i had fallen into deep water [???] [???] he says to
me [???] when i shook him . very queer he was [???] and as soon as i had roused him [???] he
got up and ran back here like a hare . '
' i am afraid that ' s true [???] ' said merry [???] ' though i don ' t know what i
said . i had an ugly dream [???] which i can ' t remember . i went to pieces . i don ' t
know what came over me . '
' i do [???] ' said strider . ' the black breath . the riders must have left
their horses outside [???] and passed back through the south - gate in secret . they
will know all the news now [???] for they have visited bill ferny ; and probably
that [???] was a spy as well . something may happen in the night [???] before

we leave bree . '
' what will happen ? ' said merry . ' will they attack the inn ? ' ' no [???] i
think not [???] ' said strider . ' they are not all here yet . and in any case that
is not their way . in dark and loneliness they are strongest ; they will not
openly attack a house where ther e are lights and many people - not until they
are desperate [???] not while all the long leagues of [???] still lie before
us . but their power is in terror [???] and already some in bree are in their
clutch . they will drive these wretches to some evil work : ferny [???] and some of
the strangers [???] and [???] maybe [???] the [???] too . they had words with harry at
west - gate on monday . i was watching them . he was white and shaking when
they
left him . '
' we seem to have enemies all round [???] ' said [???] . ' what are we to do ? '
' stay here [???] and do not go to your rooms ! they are sure to have found
out which those are . the hobbit - rooms have windows looking north and close
to the ground . we will all remain together and bar this window and the door .
but first nob and i will fetch your [???] . '
while strider was gone [???] [???] gave merry a rapid account of all that
had happened since supper . merry was still reading and pondering [???] ' s
letter when strider and nob returned .
' well masters [???] ' said nob [???] ' i ' ve ruffled up the clothes and put in a
bolster down the middle of each bed . and i made a nice imitation of your
head with a brown woollen mat [???] mr . bag - [???] [???] sir [???] ' he added with a
grin .
[???] laughed . ' very life - like ! ' he said . ' but wha t will happen when
they have [???] the disguise ? '
' we shall see [???] ' said strider . ' let us hope to hold the fort till
morning . '
' good night to you [???] ' said nob [???] and went off to take his part in the
watch on the doors .
their bags and gear they piled on the parlour - floor . they pushed a low
chair against the door and shut the window . peering out [???] [???] saw that the
night was still clear . the sickle was swinging bright above the shoulders of
bree - hill . he then closed and barred the heavy inside shutters and drew the
curtains together . strider built up the fire and blew out all the candles .
the [???] lay down on their blankets with their feet towards the
hearth ; but strider settled himself in the chair against the door . they

talked for a little [???] for merry still had several questions to ask .
' jumped over the moon ! ' [???] merry as he rolled himself in his
blanket . ' very ridiculous of you [???] [???] ! but i wish i had been there to see .
the worthies of bree will be discussing it a hundred years hence . '
' i hope so [???] ' said strider . then they all fell silent [???] and one by one
the [???] dropped off to sleep .




chapter 11 . a knife in the dark



as they prepared for sleep in the inn at bree [???] darkness lay on
buckland ; a mist strayed in the dells and along the river - bank . the house at
[???] stood silent . fatty bolger opened the door [???] and peered
out . a feeling of fear had been growing on him all day [???] and he was unable to
rest or go to bed : there was a brooding threat in the breathless night - air .
as he stared out into the gloom [???] a black shadow moved under the trees ; the
gate seemed to open of its own accord and close again without a sound .
terror seized him . he shrank back [???] and for a moment he stood trembling in
the hall . then he shut and locked the door .
the night deepened . there came the soft sound of horses led with
stealth along the lane . outside the gate they stopped [???] and three black
figures entered [???] like shades of night creeping across the ground . one went
to the door [???] one to the corner of the house on either side ; and there they
stood [???] as still as the shadows of stones [???] while night went slowly on . the
house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly .
there was a faint stir in the leaves [???] and a cock crowed far away . the
cold hour before dawn was passing . the figure by the door moved . in the dark
without moon or stars a drawn blade gleamed [???] as if a chill light had been
[???] . there was a blow [???] soft but heavy [???] and the door [???] .
' open [???] in the name of [???] ! ' said a voice thin and [???] .
at a second blow the door yielded and fell back [???] with timbers burst and
lock broken . the black figures passed swiftly in .
at that moment [???] among the trees nearby [???] a horn rang out . it rent the
night like fire on a hill - top .
awake ! fear ! fire ! foes ! awake !
fatty bolger had not been idle . as soon as he saw the dark shapes creep
from the garden [???] he knew that he must run for it [???] or perish . and run he did [???]
out of the back door [???] through the garden [???] and over the fields . when he
reached the nearest house [???] more than a mile away [???] he [???] on the
doorstep . ' no [???] no [???] no ! ' he was crying . ' no [???] not me ! i haven ' t got it ! ' it
was some time before anyone could make out what he was babbling about .
at
last they got the idea that enemies were in buckland [???] some strange invasion

from the old forest . and then they lost no more time .
fear ! fire ! foes !
the [???] were blowing the horn - call of buckland [???] that had not
been sounded for a hundred years [???] not since the white wolves came in the
fell winter [???] when the [???] was frozen over .
awake ! awake !
far - away answering horns were heard . the alarm was spreading . the black
figures fled from the house . one of them let fall a hobbit - cloak on the
step [???] as he ran . in the lane the noise of [???] broke out [???] and gathering to
a gallop [???] went hammering away into the darkness . all about [???] there
was the sound of horns blowing [???] and voices crying and feet running . but the
black riders rode like a gale to the north - gate . let the little people blow !
[???] would deal with them later . meanwhile they had another errand : they
knew now that the house was empty and the ring had gone . they rode down
the
guards at the gate and vanished from the shire .
in the early night [???] woke from deep sleep [???] suddenly [???] as if some
sound or presence had disturbed him . he saw that strider was sitting alert
in his chair : his eyes gleamed in the light of the fire [???] which had been
tended and was burning brightly ; but he made no sign or movement .
[???] soon went to sleep again ; but his dreams were again troubled with
the noise of wind and of ga [???] [???] . the wind seemed to be curling
round the house and shaking it ; and far off he heard a horn blowing wildly .
he opened his eyes [???] and heard a cock crowing lustily in the inn - yard .
strider had drawn the curtains and pushed back the shutters with a clang .
the first grey light of day was in the room [???] and a cold air was coming
through the open window .
as soon as strider had roused them all [???] he led the way to their
bedrooms . when they saw them they were glad that they had taken his advice :
the windows had been forced open and were swinging [???] and the curtains were
flapping ; the beds were tossed about [???] and the bolsters [???] and flung
upon the floor ; the brown mat was torn to pieces .
strider immediately went to fetch the landlord . poor mr . [???]
looked sleepy and frightened . he had hardly closed his eyes all night ( so he
said ) [???] but he had never heard a sound .
' never has such a thing happened in my time ! ' he cried [???] raising his
hands in horror . ' guests unable to sleep in their beds [???] and good bolsters

ruined and all ! what are we coming to ? '
' dark times [???] ' said strider . ' but for the present you may be left in
peace [???] when you have got rid of us . we will leave at once . never mind about
breakfast : a drink and a bite standing will have to do . we shall be packed
in a few minutes . '
mr . [???] hurried off to see that their [???] were got ready [???] and
to fetch them a ' bite ' . but very soon he came back in dismay . the [???] had
vanished ! the stable - doors had all been opened in the night [???] and they were
gone : not only merry ' s [???] [???] but every other horse and beast in the place .
[???] was crushed by the news . how could they hope to reach [???]
on foot [???] pursued by mounted enemies ? they might as well set out for the
moon . strider sat silent for a while [???] looking at the [???] [???] as if he was
weighing up their strength and courage .
' [???] would not help us to escape horsemen [???] ' he said at last [???]
thoughtfully [???] as if he guessed what [???] had in mind . ' we should not go
much slower on foot [???] not on the roads that i mean to take . i was going to
walk in any case . it is the food and stores that trouble me . we cannot count
on getting anything to eat between here and [???] [???] except what we take
with us ; and we ought to take plenty to spare ; for we may be delayed [???] or
forced to go round - about [???] far out of the direct way . how much are you
prepared to carry on your backs ? '
' as much as we must [???] ' said [???] with a sinking heart [???] but trying to
show that he was tougher than he looked ( or felt ) .
' i can carry enough for two [???] ' said sam [???] .
' can ' t anything be done [???] mr . [???] ? ' asked [???] . ' can ' t we get a
couple of [???] in the vi llage [???] or even one just for the [???] ? i don ' t
suppose we could hire them [???] but we might be able to buy them [???] ' he added [???]
doubtfully [???] wondering if he could afford it .
' i doubt it [???] ' said the landlord unhappily . ' the two or three
riding - [???] that there were in bree were stabled in my yard [???] and they ' re
gone . as for other animals [???] horses or [???] for draught or what not [???] there
are very few of them in bree [???] and they won ' t be for sale . but i ' ll do what i
can . i ' ll rout out bob and send him round as soon as may be . '
' yes [???] ' said strider [???] [???] ' you had better do that . i am afraid
we shall have to try to get one pony at least . but so ends all hope of
starting early [???] and slipping away quietly ! we might as well have blown a
horn to announce our departure . that was part of their plan [???] no doubt . '

' there is one crumb of comfort [???] ' said merry [???] ' and more than a crumb [???] i
hope : we can have breakfast while we wait - and sit down to it . let ' s get
hold of nob ! '
in the end there was more than three hours ' delay . bob came back with
the report that no horse or pony was to be got for love or money in the
neighbourhood - except one : bill ferny had one that he might possibly sell .
' a poor old half - starved creature it is [???] ' said bob ; ' but he won ' t part with
it for less than thrice its worth [???] seeing how you ' re placed [???] not if i knows
bill ferny . '
' bill ferny ? ' said [???] . ' isn ' t there some trick ? wouldn ' t the beast
bolt back to him with all our stuff [???] or help in tracking us [???] or something ? '
' i wonder [???] ' said strider . ' but i cannot imagine any animal running home
to him [???] once it got away . i fancy this is only an [???] of kind
master ferny ' s : just a way of increasing his profits from the affair . the
chief danger is that the poor beast is probably at death ' s door . but there
does not seem any choice . what does he want for it ? '
bill ferny ' s price was twelve silver [???] ; and that was indeed at
least three times the pony ' s value in those pans . it proved to be a bony [???]
[???] [???] and [???] animal ; but it did not look like dying just yet .
mr . [???] paid for it himself [???] and offered merry another eighteen pence
as some [???] for the lost animals . he was an honest man [???] and
well - off as things were reckoned in bree ; but thirty silver [???] was a
sore blow to him [???] and being cheated by bill ferny made it harder to bear .
as a matter of fact he came out on the right side in the end . it turned
out later that only one horse had been actually stolen . the others had been
driven off [???] or had bolted in terror [???] and were found wandering in different
corners of the bree - land . merry ' s [???] had escaped altogether [???] and
eventually ( having a good deal of sense ) they made their way to the downs in
search of fatty lumpkin . so they came under the care of tom [???] for a
while [???] and were well - off . but when news of the events at bree came to tom ' s
ears [???] he sent them to mr . [???] [???] who thus got five good beasts at a very
fair price . they had to work harder in bree [???] but bob treated them well ; so
on the whole they were lucky : they missed a dark and dangerous journey . but
they never came to [???] .
however [???] in the meanwhile for all mr . [???] knew his money was gone
for good [???] or for bad . and he had other troubles . for there was a great
commotion as soon as the remaining guests were [???] and heard news of the

raid on the inn . the southern travellers had lost several horses and blamed
the [???] loudly [???] until it became known that one of their own number had
also disappeared in the night [???] none other than bill ferny ' s squint - eyed
companion . suspicion fell on him at once .
' if you pick up with a horse - thief [???] and bring him to my house [???] ' said
[???] angrily [???] ' you ought to pay for all the damage yourselves and not
come shouting at me . go and ask ferny where your handsome friend is ! ' but it
appeared that he was nobody ' s friend [???] and nobody could [???] when he had
joined their party .
after their breakfast the [???] had to re - pack [???] and get together
further supplies for the longer journey they were now expecting . it was
close on ten o ' clock before they at last got off . by that time the whole of
bree was buzzing with [???] . [???] ' s vanishing trick ; the appearance of
the black horsemen ; the robbing of the stables ; and not least the news that
strider the ranger had joined the mysterious [???] [???] made such a tale as
would last for many [???] years . most of the inhabitants of bree and
[???] [???] and many even from combe and archet [???] were crowded in the road
to
see the travellers start . the other guests in the inn were at the doors or
hanging out of the windows .
strider had changed his mind [???] and he decided to leave bree by the main
road . any attempt to set off across country at once would only make matters
worse : half the inhabitants would follow them [???] to see what they were up to [???]
and to prevent them from trespassing .
they said farewell to nob and bob [???] and took leave of mr . [???] with
many thanks . ' i hope we shall meet again some day [???] when things are merry
once more [???] ' said [???] . ' i should like nothing better than to stay in your
house in peace for a while . '
they tramped off [???] anxious and [???] [???] under the eyes of the crowd .
not all the faces were friendly [???] nor all the words that were shouted . but
strider seemed to be held in awe by most of the bree - landers [???] and those that
he stared at shut their mouths and drew away . he walked in front with [???] ;
next came merry and [???] ; and last came sam leading the pony [???] which was
laden with as much of their [???] as they had the heart to give it ; but
already it looked less dejected [???] as if it approved of the change in its
fortunes . sam was [???] an apple thoughtfully . he had a pocket full of
them : a parting present from nob and bob . ' apples for walking [???] and a pipe

for sitting [???] ' he said . ' but i reckon i ' ll miss them both before long . '
the [???] took no notice of the [???] heads that peeped out of
doors [???] or popped over walls and fences [???] as they passed . but as they drew
near to the further gate [???] [???] saw a dark ill - kept house behind a thick
hedge : the last house in the village . in one of the windows he caught a
glimpse of a sallow face with sly [???] [???] eyes ; but it vanished at once .
' so that ' s where that [???] is hiding ! ' he thought . ' he looks more
than half like a [???] . '
over the hedge another man was staring boldly . he had heavy black
brows [???] and dark scornful eyes ; his large mouth curled in a sneer . he was
smoking a short black pipe . as they approached he took it out of his mouth
and spat .
' morning [???] [???] ! ' he said . ' off early ? found some friends at
last ? ' strider nodded [???] but did not answer . ' morning [???] my little friends ! ' he
said to the others . ' i suppose you know who you ' ve taken up with ? that ' s
stick - at - naught strider [???] that is ! though i ' ve heard other names not so
pretty . watch out tonight ! and you [???] [???] [???] don ' t go ill - treating my poor
old pony ! pah ! ' he spat again .
sam turned quickly . ' and you . ferny [???] ' he said [???] ' put your ugly face out
of sight [???] or it will get hurt . ' with a sudden flick [???] quick as lightning [???] an
apple left his hand and hit bill square on the nose . he ducked too late [???] and
curses came from behind the hedge . ' waste of a good apple [???] ' said sam
[???] [???] and strode on .
at last they left the village behind . the escort of children and
[???] that had followed them got tired and turned back at the
south - gate . passing through [???] they kept on along the road for some miles . it
bent to the left [???] curving back into its eastward line as it rounded the feet
of bree - hill [???] and then it began to run swiftly downwards into wooded
country . to their left they could see some of the houses and hobbit - holes of
[???] on the gentler south - eastern [???] of the hill ; down in a deep
hollow away north of the road there were wisps of rising smoke that showed
where combe lay ;
archet was hidden in the trees beyond .
after the road had run down some way [???] and had left bree - hill standing
tall and brown behind [???] they came on a narrow track that led off towards the
north . ' this is where we leave the open and take to cover [???] ' said strider .
' not a [???] short cut [???] [???] i hope [???] ' said [???] . ' our last short cut through

woods nearly ended in disaster . '
' ah [???] but you had not got me with you then [???] ' laughed strider . ' my cuts [???]
short or long [???] don ' t go wrong . ' he took a look up and down the road . no one
was in sight ; and he led the way quickly down towards the wooded valley .
his plan [???] as far as they could understand it without knowing the
country [???] was to go towards archet at first [???] but to bear right and pass it on
the east [???] and then to steer as straight as he could over the wild lands to
[???] hill . in that way they would [???] if all went well [???] cut off a great
loop of the road [???] which further on bent southwards to avoid the [???]
marshes . but [???] of course [???] they would have to pass through the marshes
themselves [???] and strider ' s description of them was not encouraging .
however [???] in the meanwhile [???] walking was not [???] . indeed [???] if it
had not been for the disturbing events of the night before [???] they would have
enjoyed this pan of the journey better than any up to that time . the sun was
shining [???] clear but not too hot . the woods in the valley were still leafy and
full of colour [???] and seemed peaceful and wholesome . strider guided them
confidently among the many crossing paths [???] although left to themselves they
would soon have been at a loss . he was taking a wandering course with many
turns and doublings [???] to put off any pursuit .
' bill ferny will have watched where we left the road [???] for certain [???] ' he
said ; ' though i don ' t think he will follow us himself . he knows the land
round here well enough [???] but he knows he is not a match for me in a wood . it
is what he may tell others that i am afraid of . i don ' t suppose they are far
away . if they think we have made for archet [???] so much the better . '
whether because of strider ' s skill or for some other reason [???] they saw
no sign and heard no sound of any other living thing all that day : neither
two - footed [???] except birds ; nor four - footed [???] except one fox and a few
[???] . the next day they began to steer a steady course eastwards ; and
still all was quiet and peaceful . on the third day out from bree they came
out of the [???] . the land had been falling steadily [???] ever since they
turned aside from the road [???] and they now entered a wide flat [???] of
country [???] much more difficult to manage . they were far beyond the borders of
the bree - land [???] out in the pathless wilderness [???] and drawing near to the
midge - water marshes .
the ground now became damp [???] and in places [???] and here and there they
came upon [???] [???] and wide stretches of reeds and rushes filled with the
warbling of little hidden birds . they had to pick their way carefully to

keep both dry - footed and on their proper course . at first they made
fan - progress [???] but as they went on [???] their passage became slower and more
dangerous . the marshes were [???] and treacherous [???] and there was no
permanent trail even for rangers to find through their shifting [???] .
the flies began to torment them [???] and the air was full of clouds of tiny
midges that crept up their sleeves and breeches and into their hair .
' i am being eaten alive ! ' cried [???] . ' [???] ! there are more
midges than water ! '
' what do they live on when they can ' t get hobbit ? ' asked sam [???]
scratching his neck .
they spent a miserable day in this lonely and [???] country . their
camping - place was damp [???] cold [???] and uncomfortable ; and the biting [???]
would not let them sleep . there were also abominable creatures haunting the
reeds and [???] that from the sound of them were evil [???] of the
[???] . there were thousands of them [???] and they squeaked all round [???]
neek - breek [???] breek - neek [???] [???] all the night [???] until the [???] were
nearly frantic .
the next day [???] the fourth [???] was little better [???] and the night almost as
comfortless . though the [???] ( as sam called them ) had been left
behind [???] the midges still pursued them .
as [???] lay [???] tired but unable to close his eyes [???] it seemed to him that
far away there came a light in the eastern sky : it flashed and faded many
times . it was not the dawn [???] for that was still some hours off .
' what is the light ? ' he said to strider [???] who had risen [???] and was
standing [???] gazing ahead into the night .
' i do not know [???] ' strider answered . ' it is too distant to make out . it
is like lightning that leaps up from the hill - tops . '
[???] lay down again [???] but for a long while he could still see the white
flashes [???] and against them the tall dark figure of strider [???] standing silent
and watchful . at last he passed into uneasy sleep .
they had not gone far on the fifth day when they left the last
[???] [???] and reed - beds of the marshes behind them . the land before
them began steadily to rise again . away in the distance eastward they could
now see a line of hills . the highest of them was at the right of the line
and a little separated from the others . it had a conical top [???] slightly
[???] at the summit .
' that is [???] [???] ' said strider . ' the old road [???] which we have left

far away on our right [???] runs to the south of it and passes not far from its
foot . we might reach it by noon tomorrow [???] if we go straight towards it . i
suppose we had better do so . '
' what do you mean ? ' asked [???] .
' i mean : when we do get there [???] it is not certain what we shall find . it
is close to the road . '
' but surely we wer e hoping to find [???] there ? '
' yes ; but the hope is faint . if he comes this way at all [???] he may not
pass through bree [???] and so he may not know what we are doing . and anyway [???]
unless by luck we arrive almost together [???] we shall miss one another ; it will
not be safe for him or for us to wait there long . if the riders fail to find
us in the wilderness [???] they are likely to make for [???] themselves . it
commands a wide view all round . indeed [???] there are many birds and beasts in
this country that could see us [???] as we stand here [???] from that hill - top . not
all the birds are to be trusted [???] and there are other spies more evil than
they are . '
the [???] looked anxiously at the distant hills . sam looked up into
the pale sky [???] fearing to see hawks or eagles hovering over them with bright
[???] eyes . ' you do make me feel uncomfortable and lonesome [???] strider ! '
he said .
' what do you advise us to do ? ' asked [???] .
' i think [???] ' answered strider slowly [???] as if he was not quite sure [???] ' i
think the best thing is to go as straight eastward from here as we can [???] to
make for the line of hills [???] not for [???] . there we can strike a path i
know that runs at their feet ; it will bring us to [???] from the north
and less openly . then we shall see what we shall see . '
all that day they [???] along [???] until the cold and early evening came
down . the land became drier and more barren ; but mists and vapours lay
behind them on the marshes . a few melancholy birds were piping and wa iling [???]
until the round red sun sank slowly into the western shadows ; then an empty
silence fell . the [???] thought of the soft light of sunset glancing
through the cheerful windows of bag end far away .
at the day ' s end they came to a stream that wandered down from the
hills to lose itself in the [???] marshland [???] and they went up along its
banks while the light lasted . it was already night when at last they halted
and made their camp under some [???] alder - trees by the shores of the
stream . ahead there loomed now against the [???] sky the bleak and treeless

backs of the hills . that night they set a watch [???] and strider [???] it seemed [???] did
not sleep at all . the moon was waxing [???] and in the early night - hours a cold
grey light lay on the land .
next morning they set out again soon after [???] . there was a frost
in the air [???] and the sky was a pale clear blue . the [???] felt refreshed [???]
as if they had had a night of [???] sleep . already they were getting used
to much walking on short commons - shorter at any rate than what in the
shire they would have thought barely enough to keep them on their legs .
[???] declared that [???] was looking twice the hobbit that he had been .
' very odd [???] ' said [???] [???] tightening his belt [???] ' considering that there is
actually a good deal less of me . i hope the thinning process will not go on
[???] [???] or i shall become a wraith . '
' do not speak of such things ! ' said strider quickly [???] and with
surprising earnestness .
the hills drew nearer . they made an [???] ridge [???] often rising
almost to a thousand feet [???] and here and there falling again to low [???] or
passes leading into the eastern land beyond . along the crest of the ridge
the [???] could see what looked to be the remains of green - grown walls and
dikes [???] and in the [???] there still stood the ruins of old works of stone .
by night they had reached the feet of the westward [???] [???] and there they
camped . it was the night of the fifth of [???] [???] a nd they were six days out
from bree .
in the morning they found [???] for the first time since they had left the
[???] [???] a track plain to see . they turned right and followed it
southwards . it ran cunningly [???] taking a line that seemed chosen so as to keep
as much hidden as possible from the view [???] both of the hill - tops above and of
the flats to the west . it dived into dells [???] and hugged steep banks ; and
where it passed over flatter and more open ground on either side of it there
were lines of large [???] and hewn stones that screened the travellers
almost like a hedge .
' i wonder who made this path [???] and what for [???] ' said merry [???] as they walked
along one of these avenues [???] where the stones were unusually large and
closely set . ' i am not sure that i like it : it has a - well [???] rather a
barrow - [???] look . is there any barrow on [???] ? '
' no . there is no barrow on [???] [???] nor on any of these hills [???] '
answered strider . ' the men of the west did not live here ; though in their
latter days they defended the hills for a while against the evil that came

out of [???] . this path was made to serve the forts along the walls . but
long before [???] in the first days of the north kingdom [???] they built a great
watch - tower on [???] [???] amon syl they called it . it was burned and
broken [???] and nothing remains of it now but a tumbled ring [???] like a rough crown
on the old hill ' s head . yet once it was tall and fair . it is told that
[???] stood there watching for the coming of gil - [???] out of the west [???] in
the days of the last alliance . '
the [???] gazed at strider . it seemed that he was learned in old
lore [???] as well as in the ways of the wild . ' who was gil - [???] ? ' asked merry ;
but strider did not answer [???] and seemed to be lost in thought . suddenly a low
voice murmured :
gil - [???] was an elven - king .
of him the harpers sadly sing :
the last whose realm was fair and free
between the mountains and the sea .

his sword was long [???] his lance was keen [???]
his shining helm afar was seen ;
the countless stars of heaven ' s field
were mirrored in his silver shield .

but long ago he rode away [???]
and where he dwelleth none can say ;
for into darkness fell his star
in [???] where the shadows are .
the others turned in amazement [???] for the voice was sam ' s .
' don ' t stop ! ' said merry .
' that ' s all i know [???] ' [???] sam [???] blushing . ' i learned it from mr .
[???] when i was a lad . he used to tell me tales like that [???] knowing how i
was always one for hearing about elves . it was mr . [???] as taught me my
letters . he was mighty book - learned was dear old mr . [???] . and he wrote
poetry . he wrote what i have just said . '
' he did not make it up [???] ' said strider . ' it is pan of the lay that is
called the fall of gil - [???] [???] which is in an ancient tongue . [???] must have
translated it . i never knew that . '
' there was a lot more [???] ' said sam [???] ' all about [???] . i didn ' t learn
that part [???] it gave me the shivers i never thought i should be going that way

myself ! '
' going to [???] ! ' cried [???] . ' i hope it won ' t come to that ! '
' do not speak that name so loudly ! ' said strider .
it was already mid - day when they drew near the southern end of the
path [???] and saw before them [???] in the pale clear light of the [???] sun [???] a
grey - green bank [???] leading up like a bridge on to the northward slope of the
hill they decided to make for the top at once [???] while the daylight was broad
concealment was no longer possible [???] and they could only hope that no enemy
or spy was observing them . nothing was to be seen moving on the hill . if
[???] was anywhere about [???] there was no sign of him .
on the western flank of [???] they found a sheltered hollow [???] at
the bottom of which there was a bowl - shaped dell with grassy sides . there
they left sam and [???] with the pony and their packs and [???] . the
other three went on . after half an hour ' s [???] climb strider reached the
crown of the hill ; [???] and merry followed [???] tired and breathless . the last
slope had been steep and rocky .
on the top they found [???] as strider had said [???] a wide ring of ancient
stonework [???] now crumbling or covered with age - long grass . but in the centre a
[???] of broken st ones had been piled . they were blackened as if with fire .
about them the turf was burned to the roots and all within the ring the
grass was [???] and [???] [???] as if flames had swept the hill - top ; but
there was no sign of any living thing .
standing upon the rim of the ruined circle [???] they saw all round below
them a wide prospect [???] for the most pan of lands empty and featureless [???]
except for patches of woodland away to the south [???] beyond which they caught
here and there the glint of distant water . beneath them on this southern
side there ran like a ribbon the old road [???] coming out of the west and
winding up and down [???] until it faded behind a ridge of dark land to the east .
nothing was moving on it . following its line eastward with their eyes they
saw the mountains : the nearer [???] were brown and [???] ;
behind them stood taller shapes of grey [???] and behind those again were
high white peaks [???] among the clouds .
' well [???] here we are ! ' said merry . ' and very cheerless and [???] it
looks ! there is no water and no shelter . and no sign of [???] . but i don ' t
blame him for not waiting - if he ever came here . '
' i wonder [???] ' said strider [???] looking round thoughtfully . ' even if he was a
day or two behind us at bree [???] he could have arrived here first . he can ride

very swiftly when need presses . ' suddenly he stooped and looked at the stone
on the top of the [???] ; it was flatter than the others [???] and whiter [???] as if
it had escaped the fire . he picked it up and examined it [???] turning it in his
fingers . [???] this has been handled recently [???] ' he said . ' what do you think of
these marks ? '
on the flat under - side [???] saw some scratches : ' there seems to he a
stroke [???] a dot [???] and three more strokes [???] ' he said .
' the stroke on the left might be a g - rune with thin branches [???] ' said
strider . ' it might be a sign left by [???] [???] though one cannot be sure . the
scratches are fine [???] and they certainly look fresh . but the marks might mean
something quite different [???] and have nothing to do with us . rangers use
runes [???] and they come here sometimes . '
' what could they mean [???] even if [???] made them ? ' asked merry
' i should say [???] ' answered strider [???] ' that they stood for g3 [???] and were a
sign that [???] was here on [???] the third : that is three days ago now .
it would also show that he was in a hurry and danger was at hand [???] so that he
had no time or did not dare to write anything longer or plainer . if that is
so [???] we must be wary . '
' i wish we could feel sure that he made the marks [???] whatever they may
mean [???] ' said [???] ' it would be a great comfort to know that he was on the
way [???] in front of us or behind us . '
' perhaps [???] ' said strider . ' for myself [???] i believe that he was here [???] and
was in danger . there have been [???] flames here ; and now the light that
we saw three nights ago in the eastern sky comes back to my mind . i guess
that he was attacked on this hill - top [???] but with what result i cannot tell .
he is here no longer [???] and we must now look aft er ourselves and make our own
way to [???] [???] as best we can '
' how far is [???] ? ' asked merry [???] gazing round wearily . the world
looked wild and wide from [???] .
' i don ' t know if the road has ever been measured in miles beyond the
forsaken inn [???] a day ' s journey east of bree [???] ' answered strider . ' some say it
is so far [???] and some say otherwise . it is a strange road [???] and folk are glad
to reach their journey ' s end [???] whether the time is long or short . but i know
how long it would take me on my own feet [???] with fair weather and no ill
fortune twelve days from here to the ford of [???] [???] where the road crosses
the loudwater that runs out of [???] . we have at least a fortnight ' s
journey before us [???] for i do not think we shall be able to use the road . '

' a fortnight ! ' said [???] . ' a lot may happen in that time . '
' it may [???] ' said strider .
they stood for a while silent on the hill - top [???] near its southward edge .
in that lonely place [???] for the first time fully realized his
[???] and danger . he wished bitterly that his fortune had left him in
the quiet and beloved shire . he stared down at the hateful road [???] leading
back westward - to his home . suddenly he was aware that two black specks
were moving slowly along it [???] going westward ; and looking again he saw that
three others were creeping eastward to meet them . he gave a cry and clutched
strider ' s arm .
' look [???] ' he said [???] pointing downwards .
at once strider flung himself on the ground behind the ruined circle [???]
pulling [???] down beside him . merry threw himself alongside .
' what is it ? ' he whispered .
' i do not know [???] but i fear the worst [???] ' answered strider .
slowly they [???] up to the edge of the ring again [???] and peered
through a cleft between two jagged stones . the light was no longer bright [???]
for the clear morning had faded [???] and clouds creeping out of the east had now
overtaken the sun [???] as it began to go down . they could all see the black
specks [???] but neither [???] nor merry could make out their shapes for certain ;
yet something told them that there [???] far below [???] were black riders assembling
on the road beyond the foot of the hill .
' yes [???] ' said strider [???] whose keener sight left him in no doubt . ' the
enemy is here ! '
hastily they crept away and slipped down the north side of the hill to
find their companions .
sam and [???] had not been idle . they had explored the small dell
and the [???] [???] . not far away they found a spring of clear water
in the hillside [???] and near it [???] not more than a day or two old . in
the dell itself they found recent traces of a fire [???] and other signs of a
hasty camp . there were some fallen rocks on the edge of the dell nearest to
the hill . behind them sam came upon a small store of [???] neatly
[???] .
' i wonder if old [???] has been here [???] ' he said to [???] . ' whoever it
was put this stuff here meant to come back it seems . '
strider was greatly interested in these discoveries . ' i wish i had
waited and explored the ground down here myself [???] ' he said [???] hurrying off to

the spring to examine the [???] .
' it is just as i feared [???] ' he said [???] when he came back . ' sam and [???]
have trampled the soft ground [???] and the marks are spoilt or confused . rangers
have been here lately . it is they who left the [???] behind . but there
are also several newer tracks that were not made by rangers . at least one
set was made [???] only a day or two ago [???] by heavy boots . at least one . i cannot
now be certain [???] but i think there were many booted feet . ' he paused and
stood in anxious thought .
each of the [???] saw in his mind a vision of the cloaked and booted
riders . if the horsemen had already found the dell [???] the sooner strider led
them somewhere else the better . sam viewed the hollow with great dislike [???]
now that he had heard news of their enemies on the road [???] only a few miles
away .
' hadn ' t we better clear out quick [???] mr . strider ? ' he asked impatiently .
' it is get ting late [???] and i don ' t like this hole : it makes my heart sink
somehow . '
' yes [???] we certainly must decide what to do at once [???] ' answered strider [???]
looking up and considering the time and the weather . ' well [???] sam [???] ' he said at
last [???] ' i do not like th is place either ; but i cannot think of anywhere
better that we could reach before nightfall . at least we are out of sight
for the moment [???] and if we moved we should be much more likely to be seen by
spies . all we could do would be to go right out of our way back north on
this side of the line of hills [???] where the land is all much the same as it is
here . the road is watched [???] but we should have to cross it [???] if we tried to
take cover in the thickets away to the south . on the north side of the road
beyond the hills the country is bare and flat for miles . '
' can the riders see ? ' asked merry . ' i mean [???] they seem usually to have
used their noses rather than their eyes [???] smelling for us [???] if smelling is the
right word [???] at least in the daylight . but you made us lie down flat when you
saw them down below ; and now you talk of being seen [???] if we move . '
' i was too careless on the hill - top [???] ' answered strider . ' i was very
anxious to find some sign of [???] ; but it was a mistake for three of us
to go up and stand there so long . for the black horses can see [???] and the
riders can use men and other creatures as spies [???] as we found at bree . they
themselves do not see the world of light as we do [???] but our shapes cast
shadows in their minds [???] which only the noon sun destroys ; and in the dark
they perceive many signs and forms that are hidden from us : then they are

most to be feared . and at all times they smell the blood of living things [???]
desiring and hating it . senses [???] too [???] there are other than sight or smell . we
can feel their presence - it troubled our hearts [???] as soon as we came here [???]
and before we saw them ; they feel ours more keenly . also [???] ' he added [???] and his
voice sank to a whisper [???] ' the ring draws them . '
' is there no escape then ? ' said [???] [???] looking round wildly . ' if i move
i shall be seen and hunted ! if i stay [???] i shall draw them to me ! '
strider laid his hand on his shoulder . ' there is still hope [???] ' he said .
' you are not alone . let us take this wood that is set ready for the fire as
a sign . there is little shelter or defence here [???] but fire shall serve for
both . [???] can put fire to his evil uses [???] as he can all things [???] but these
riders do not love it [???] and fear those who wield it . fire is our friend in
the wilderness . '
' maybe [???] ' muttered sam . ' it is also as good a way of saying [???] here we
are [???] as i can think of [???] bar shouting . '
down in the lowest and most sheltered corner of the dell they lit a
fire [???] and prepared a meal . the shades of evening began to fall [???] and it grew
cold . they were suddenly aware of great hunger [???] for they had not eaten
anything since breakfast ; but they dared not make more than a [???] supper .
the lands ahead were empty of all save birds and beasts [???] [???] places
deserted by all the races of the world . rangers passed at times beyond the
hills [???] but they were few and did not stay . other wanderers were rare [???] and of
evil sort : [???] might stray down at times out of the northern [???] of
the misty mountains . only on the road would travellers be found [???] most often
[???] [???] hurrying along on business of their own [???] and with no help and few
words to spare for strangers .
' i don ' t see how our food can be made to last [???] ' said [???] . ' we have
been careful enough in the last few days [???] and this supper is no feast ; but
we have used more than we ought [???] if we have two weeks still to go [???] and
perhaps more . '
' there is food in the wild [???] ' said strider ; ' berry [???] root [???] and herb ; and
i have some skill as a hunter at need . you need not be afraid of starving
before winter comes . but gathering and catching food is long and weary work [???]
and we need haste . so tighten your belts [???] and think with hope of the tables
of [???] ' s house ! '
the cold increased as darkness came on . peering out from the edge of
the dell they could see nothing but a grey land now vanishing quickly into

shadow . the sky above had cleared again and was slowly filled with [???]
stars . [???] and his companions [???] round the fire [???] wrapped in every
garment and blanket they possessed ; but strider was content with a single
cloak [???] and sat a little apart [???] drawing thoughtfully at his pipe .
as night fell and the light of the fire began to shine out brightly he
began to tell them tales to keep their minds from fear . he knew many
histories and [???] of long ago [???] of elves and men and the good and evil
deeds of the elder days . they wondered how old he was [???] and where he had
learned all this lore .
' tell us of gil - [???] [???] ' said merry suddenly [???] when he paused at the end
of a story of the elf - kingdoms . ' do you know any more of that old lay that
you spoke of ? '
' i do indeed [???] ' answered strider . ' so also does [???] [???] for it concerns
us closely . ' merry and [???] looked at [???] [???] who was staring into the
fire .
' i know only the little that [???] has told me [???] ' said [???] slowly .
' gil - [???] was the last of the great elf - kings of middle - earth . gil - [???] is
starlight in their tongue . with [???] [???] the elf - friend [???] he went to the land
of - - - - - - '
' no ! ' said strider interrupting [???] ' i do not think that tale should be
told now with the servants of the enemy at hand . if we win through to the
house of [???] [???] you may hear it there [???] told in full . '
' then tell u s some other tale of the old days [???] ' begged sam ; ' a tale
about the elves before the fading time . i would dearly like to hear more
about elves ; the dark seems to press round so close . '
' i will tell you the tale of tin [???] viel [???] ' said strider [???] ' in br ief - for
it is a long tale of which the end is not known ; and there are none now [???]
except [???] [???] that remember it aright as it was told of old . it is a fair
tale [???] though it is sad [???] as are all the tales of middle - earth [???] and yet it may
lift up your hearts . ' he was silent for some time [???] and then he began not to
speak but to chant softly :
the leaves were long [???] the grass was green [???]
the hemlock - [???] tall and fair [???]
and in the glade a light was seen
of stars in shadow [???] .
tin [???] viel was dancing there
to music of a pipe unseen [???]

and light of stars was in her hair [???]
and in her raiment [???] .

there beren came from mountains cold [???]
and lost he wandered under leaves [???]
and where the elven - river rolled
he walked alone and sorrowing .
he peered between the hemlock - leaves
and saw in wander flowers of gold
upon her mantle and her sleeves [???]
and her hair like shadow following .

enchantment healed his weary feet
that over hills were doomed to roam ;
and forth he hastened [???] strong and fleet [???]
and grasped at [???] [???] .
through woven woods in [???]
she tightly fled on dancing feet [???]
and left him lonely still to roam
in the silent forest listening .

he heard there oft the flying sound
of feet as light as linden - leaves [???]
or music welling underground [???]
in hidden hollows [???] .
now withered lay the hemlock - sheaves [???]
and one by one with sighing sound
whispering fell the [???] leaves
in the wintry woodland wavering .

he sought her ever [???] wandering far
where leaves of years were thickly strewn [???]
by light of moon and ray of star
in frosty heavens shivering .
her mantle glinted in the moon [???]
as on a hill - top high and far
she danced [???] and at her feet was strewn

a mist of silver [???] .

when winter passed [???] she came again [???]
and her song released the sudden spring [???]
like rising lark [???] and falling rain [???]
and melting water [???] .
he saw the elven - flowers spring
about her feet [???] and healed again
he longed by her to dance and sing
upon the grass [???] .

again she fled [???] but swift he came .
tin [???] viel ! tin [???] viel !
he called her by her elvish name ;
and there she halted listening .
one moment stood she [???] and a spell
his voice laid on her : beren came [???]
and doom fell on tin [???] viel
that in his arms lay [???] .

as beren looked into her eyes
within the shadows of her hair [???]
the trembling starlight of the skies
he saw there mirrored [???] .
tin [???] viel the elven - fair [???]
immortal maiden elven - wise [???]
about him cast her shadowy hair
and arms like silver [???] .

long was the way that fate them bore [???]
o ' er stony mountains cold and grey [???]
through halls of iron and darkling door [???]
and woods of [???] morrowless .
the sundering seas between them lay [???]
and yet at last they met once more [???]
and long ago they passed away
in the forest singing sorrowless .

strider sighed and paused before he spoke again . ' that is a song [???] ' he
said [???] ' in the mode that is called ann - [???] among the elves [???] but is hard
to render in our common speech [???] and this is but a rough echo of it . it tells
of the meeting of beren son of [???] and l [???] thien tin [???] viel . beren was a
mortal man [???] but l [???] thien was the daughter of thingol [???] a king of elves upon
middle - earth when the world was young ; and she was the fairest maiden that
has ever been among all the children of this world . as the stars above the
mists of the northern lands was her loveliness [???] and in her face was a
shining light . in those days the great enemy [???] of whom [???] of [???] was
but a servant [???] dwelt in angband in the north [???] and the elves of the west
coming back to middle - earth made war upon him to regain the [???] which
he had stolen ; and the fathers of men aided the elves . but the enemy was
victorious and [???] was slain [???] and beren escaping through great peril
came over the mountains of terror into the hidden kingdom of thingol in the
forest of [???] . there he beheld l [???] thien singing and dancing in a glade
beside the enchanted river [???] ; and he named her tin [???] viel [???] that is
nightingale in the language of old . many sorrows befell them afterwards [???] and
they were parted long . tin [???] viel rescued beren from the dungeons of [???] [???]
and together they passed through great dangers [???] and cast down even the great
enemy from his throne [???] and took from his iron crown one of the three
[???] [???] brightest of all jewels [???] to be the bride - price of l [???] thien to
thingol her father . yet at the last beren was slain by the wolf that came
from the gates of angband [???] and he died in the arms of tin [???] viel . but she
chose mortality [???] and to die from the world [???] so that she might follow him ;
and it is sung that they met again beyond the sundering seas [???] and after a
brief time walking alive once more in the green woods [???] together they passed [???]
long ago [???] beyond the confines of this world . so it is that l [???] thien tin [???] viel
alone of the elf - kindred has died indeed and left the world [???] and they have
lost her whom they most loved . but from her the lineage of the elf - lords of
old descended among men . there live still those of whom l [???] thien was the
[???] [???] and it is said that her line shall never fail . [???] of
[???] is of that kin . for of beren and l [???] thien was born dior thingol ' s
heir ; and of him [???] the white whom [???] wedded [???] he that sailed his
ship out of the mists of the world into the seas of heaven with the [???]
upon his brow . and of [???] came the kings of n [???] menor [???] that is
westernesse . '
as strider was speaking they watched his strange eager face [???] dimly lit

in the red glow of the wood - fire . his eyes shone [???] and his voice was rich and
deep . above him was a black starry sky . suddenly a pale light appeared over
the crown of [???] behind him . the waxing moon was climbing
slowly
above the hill that [???] them [???] and the stars above the hill - top
faded .
the story ended . the [???] moved and stretched . ' look ! ' said merry .
' the moon is rising : it must be getting late . '
the others looked up . even as they did so [???] they saw on the top of the
hill something small and dark against the glimmer of the [???] . it was
perhaps only a large stone or [???] rock shown up by the pale light .
sam and merry got up and walked away from the fire . [???] and [???]
remained seated in silence . strider was watching the moonlight on the hill
intently . all seemed quiet and still [???] but [???] felt a cold dread creeping
over his heart [???] now that strider was no longer speaking . he [???] closer
to the fire . at that moment sam came running back from the edge of the dell .
' i don ' t know what it is [???] ' he said [???] ' but i suddenly felt afraid . i
durstn ' t go outside this dell for any money ; i felt that something was
creeping up the slope . '
' did you see anything ? ' asked [???] [???] springing to his feet .
' no [???] sir . i saw nothing [???] but i didn ' t stop to look . '
' i saw something [???] ' said merry ; ' or i thought i did - away westwards
where the moonlight was falling on the flats beyond the shadow of the
hill - tops [???] i thought there were two or three black shapes . they seemed to be
moving this way . '
' keep close to the fire [???] with your faces outward ! ' cried strider . ' get
some of the longer sticks ready in your hands ! '
for a breathless time they sat there [???] silent and alert [???] with their
backs turned to the wood - fire [???] each gazing into the shadows that [???]
them . nothing happened . there was no sound or movement in the night .
[???]
stirred [???] feeling that he must break the silence : he longed to shout out
aloud .
' hush ! ' whispered strider . ' what ' s that ? ' gasped [???] at the same
moment .
over the lip of the little dell [???] on the side away from the hill [???] they
felt [???] rather than saw [???] a shadow rise [???] one shadow or more than one . they

strained their eyes [???] and the shadows seemed to grow . soon there could be no
doubt :
three or four tall black figures were standing there on the slope [???]
looking down on them . so black were they that they seemed like black holes
in the deep shade behind them . [???] thought that he heard a faint hiss as
of venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill . then the shapes slowly
advanced .
terror overcame [???] and merry [???] and they threw themselves flat on the
ground . sam shrank to [???] ' s side . [???] was hardly less terrified than his
companions ; he was quaking as if he was bitter cold [???] but his terror was
swallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the ring . the desire to do
this laid hold of him [???] and he could think of nothing else . he did not forget
the barrow [???] nor the message of [???] ; but something seemed to be
compelling him to [???] all warnings [???] and he longed to yield . not with
the hope of escape [???] or of doing anything [???] either good or bad : he simply felt
that he must take the ring and put it on his finger . he could not speak . he
felt sam looking at him [???] as if he knew that his master was in some great
trouble [???] but he could not turn towards him . he shut his eyes and struggled
for a while ; but resistance became [???] [???] and at last he slowly drew
out the chain [???] and slipped the ring on the forefinger of his left hand .
immediately [???] though everything else remained as before [???] dim and dark [???]
the shapes became terribly clear . he was able to see beneath their black
[???] . there were five tall figures : two standing on the lip of the
dell [???] three advancing . in their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes ;
under their mantles were long grey robes ; upon their grey hairs were helms
of silver ; in their [???] hands were swords of steel . their eyes fell on
him and pierced him [???] as they rushed towards him . desperate [???] he drew his own
sword [???] and it seemed to him that it [???] red [???] as if it was a [???] .
two of the figures halted . the third was taller than the others : his hair
was long and gleaming and on his helm was a crown . in one hand he held a
long sword [???] and in the other a knife ; both the knife and the hand that held
it glowed with a pale light . he sprang forward and bore down on [???] .
at that moment [???] threw himself forward on the ground [???] and he heard
himself crying aloud : o [???] ! [???] ! at the same time he struck at
the feet of his enemy . a shrill cry rang out in the night ; and he felt a
pain like a dart of poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder . even as he
swooned he caught [???] as through a [???] mist [???] a glimpse of strider leaping

out of the darkness with a flaming brand of wood in either hand . with a last
effort [???] [???] dropping his sword [???] slipped the ring from his finger and
closed his right hand tight upon it .




chapter 12 . flight to the ford



when [???] came to himself he was still clutching the ring desperately .
he was lying by the fire [???] which was now piled high and burning br [???] . his
three companions were bending over him . ' what has happened ? where is the
pale king ? ' he asked wildly . they were too [???] to hear him speak to
answer for a while ; nor did they understand his question . at length he
gathered from sam that they had seen nothing but the vague shadowy shapes
coming towards them . suddenly to his horror sam found that his master had
vanished ; and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him [???] and he fell . he
heard [???] ' s voice [???] but it seemed to come from a great distance [???] or from
under the earth [???] crying out strange words . they saw nothing more [???] until they
[???] over the body of [???] [???] lying as if dead [???] face downwards on the
grass with his sword beneath him . strider ordered them to pick him up and
lay him near the fire [???] and then he disappeared . that was now a good while
ago .
sam plainly was beginning to have doubts again about strider ; but while
they were talking he returned [???] appearing suddenly out of the shadows . they
started [???] and sam drew his sword and stood over [???] ; but strider knelt down
swiftly at his side .
' i am not a black rider [???] sam [???] ' he said gently [???] ' nor in league with
them . i have been trying to discover something of their movements ; but i
have found nothing . i cannot think why they have gone and do not attack
again . but there is no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand . '
when he heard what [???] had to tell [???] he became full of concern [???] and
shook his head and sighed . then he ordered [???] and merry to heat as much
water as they could in their small [???] [???] and to bathe the wound with it .
' keep the fire going well [???] and keep [???] warm ! ' he said . then he got up and
walked away [???] and called sam to him . ' i think i understand things better
now [???] ' he said in a low voice . ' there seem only to have been five of the
enemy . why they were not all here [???] i don ' t know ; but i don ' t think they
expected to be resisted . they have drawn off for the time being . but not
far [???] i fear . they will come again another night [???] if we cannot escape . they
are only waiting [???] because they think that their purpose is almost
accomplished [???] and that the ring cannot fly much further . i fear [???] sam [???] that

they believe your master has a deadly wound that will subdue him to their
will . we shall see ! ' sam choked with tears . ' don ' t despair ! ' said strider .
' you must trust me now . your [???] is made of sterner stuff than i had
guessed [???] though [???] hinted that it might prove so . he is not slain [???] and
i think he will resist the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies
expect . i will do all i can to help and heal him . guard him well [???] while i am
away ! ' he hurried off and disappeared again into the darkness .
[???] dozed [???] though the pain of his wound was slowly growing [???] and a
deadly chill was spreading from his shoulder to his arm and side . his
friends watched over him [???] warming him [???] and bathing his wound . the night
passed slowly and wearily . dawn was growing in the sky [???] and the dell was
filling with grey light [???] when strider at last returned .
' look ! ' he cried ; and stooping he lifted from the ground a black cloak
that had lain there hidden by the darkness . a foot above the lower hem there
was a slash . ' this was the stroke of [???] ' s sword [???] ' he said . ' the only hurt
that it did to his enemy [???] i fear ; for it is [???] [???] but all blades perish
that pierce that dreadful king . more deadly to him was the name of
[???] . '
' and more deadly to [???] was this ! ' he stooped again and lifted up a
long thin knife . there was a cold gleam in it . as strider raised it they saw
that near the end its edge was notched and the point was broken off . but
even as he held it up in the growing light [???] they gazed in astonishment [???] for
the blade seemed to melt [???] and vanished like a smoke in the air [???] leaving only
the hilt in strider ' s hand . ' alas ! ' he cried . ' it was this accursed knife
that gave the wound . few now have the skill in healing to match such evil
weapons . but i will do what i can . '
he sat down on the ground [???] and taking the dagger - hilt laid it on his
knees [???] and he sang over it a slow song in a strange tongue . then setting it
aside [???] he turned to [???] and in a soft tone spoke words the others could
not catch . from the pouch at his belt he drew out the long leaves of a
plant .
' these leaves [???] ' he said [???] ' i have walked far to find ; for this plant
does not grow in the bare hills ; but in the thickets away south of the road
i found it in the dark by the scent of its leaves . ' he crushed a leaf in his
fingers [???] and it gave out a sweet and [???] fragrance . ' it is fortunate
that i could find it [???] for it is a healing plant that the men of the west
brought to middle - earth . [???] they named it [???] and it grows now [???]

and only near places where they dwelt or camped of old ; and it is not known
in the north [???] except to some of those who wander in the wild . it has great
virtues [???] but over such a wound as this its healing powers may be small . '
he threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed [???] ' s shoulder . the
fragrance of the steam was refreshing [???] and those that were [???] felt their
minds calmed and cleared . the herb had also some power over the wound [???] for
[???] felt the pain and also the sense of frozen cold lessen in his side ;
but the life did not return to his arm [???] and he could not raise or use his
hand . he bitterly [???] his foolishness [???] and reproached himself for
weakness of will ; for he now perceived that in putting on the ring he obeyed
not his own desire but the commanding wish of his enemies . he wondered if he
would remain [???] for life [???] and how they would now manage to continue
their journey . he fell too weak to stand .
the others were discussing this very question . they quickly decided to
leave [???] as soon as possible . ' i think now [???] ' said strider [???] ' that the
enemy has been watching this place for some days . if [???] ever came here [???]
then he must have been forced to ride away [???] and he will not return . in any
case we are in great peril here after dark [???] since the attack of last night [???]
and we can hardly meet greater danger wherever we go . '
as soon as the daylight was full [???] they had some hurried food and
packed . it was impossible for [???] to walk [???] so they divided the greater
part of their [???] among the four of them [???] and put [???] on the pony . in
the last few days the poor beast had improved wonderfully ; it already seemed
fatter and stronger [???] and had begun to show an a ffection for its new masters [???]
especially for sam . bill ferny ' s treatment must have been very hard for the
journey in the wild to seem so much better than its former life .
they started off in a [???] direction . this would mean crossing the
road [???] but . it was the quickest way to more wooded country . and they needed
fuel ; for strider said that [???] must be kept warm [???] especially at night [???]
while fire would be some protection for them all . it was also his plan to
shorten their journey by cutting across another great loop of the road : east
beyond [???] it changed its course and took a wide bend northwards .
they made their way slowly and [???] round the south - western
[???] of the hill [???] and came in a little while to the edge of the road .
there was no sign of the riders . but even as they were hurrying across they
heard far away two cries : a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering .
trembling they sprang forward [???] and made for the thickets that lay ahead . the

land before them [???] away southwards [???] but it was wild and pathless ;
bushes and [???] trees grew in dense patches with wide barren spaces in
between . the grass was scanty [???] coarse [???] and grey ; and the leaves in the
thickets were faded and falling . it was a cheerless land [???] and their journey
was slow and gloomy . they spoke little as they [???] along . [???] ' s heart
was grieved as he watched them walking beside him with their heads down [???]
and
their backs bowed under their burdens . even strider seemed tired and
heavy - hearted .
before the first day ' s march was over [???] ' s pain began to grow again [???]
but he did not speak of it for a long time . four days passed [???] without the
ground or the scene changing much [???] except that behind them [???]
slowly
sank [???] and before them the distant mountains loomed a little nearer . yet
since that far cry they had seen and heard no sign that the enemy had marked
their flight or followed them . they dreaded the dark hours [???] and kept watch
in pairs by night [???] expecting at any time to see black shapes stalking in the
grey night [???] dimly lit by the cloud - veiled moon ; but they saw nothing [???] and
heard no sound but the sigh of withered leaves and grass . not once did they
feel the sense of present evil that had assailed them before the attack in
the dell . it seemed too much to hope that the riders had already lost their
trail again . perhaps they were waiting to make some ambush in a narrow
place ?
at the end of the fifth day the ground began once more to rise slowly
out of the wide shallow valley into which they had descended . strider now
turned their course again north - eastwards [???] and on the sixth day they reached
the top of a long slow - climbing slope [???] and saw far ahead a [???] of wooded
hills . away below them they could see the road sweeping round the feet of
the hills ; and to their right a grey river gleamed pale in the thin
sunshine . in the distance they [???] yet another river in a stony valley
half - veiled in mist .
[???] i am afraid we must go back to the road here for a while [???] ' said
strider . ' we have now come to the river [???] [???] that the elves call
[???] . it flows down out of the [???] [???] the troll - fells north of
[???] [???] and joins the loudwater away in the south . some call it the
[???] after that . it is a great water before it finds the sea . there is
no way over it below its sources in the [???] [???] except by the last

bridge on which the road crosses . '
' what is that other river we can see far away there ? ' asked merry .
' that is loudwater [???] the [???] of [???] [???] ' answered strider . ' the
road runs along the edge of the hills for many miles from the bridge to the
ford of [???] . but i have not yet thought how we shall cross that water .
one river at a time ! we shall be fortunate indeed if we do not find the last
bridge held against us . '
next day [???] early in the morning [???] they came down again to the borders of
the road . sam and strider went forward [???] but they found no sign of any
travellers or riders . here under the shadow of the hills there had been some
rain . strider judged that it had fallen two days before [???] and had washed away
all [???] . no horseman had passed since then [???] as far as he could see .
they hurried along with all the speed they could make [???] and after a mile
or two they saw the last bridge ahead [???] at the bottom of a short steep slope .
they dreaded to see black figures waiting there [???] but they saw none . strider
made them take cover in a thicket at the side of the road [???] while he went
forward to explore .
before long he came hurrying back . ' i can see no sign of the enemy [???] ' he
said [???] ' and i wonder very much what that means . but i have found something
very strange . '
he held out his hand [???] and showed a single pale - green jewel . ' i found it
in the mud in the middle of the bridge [???] ' he said . ' it is a [???] [???] an
elf - stone . whether it was set there [???] or let fall by chance [???] i cannot say ;
but it brings hope to me . i will take it as a sign that we may pass the
bridge ; but beyond that i dare not keep to the road [???] without some clearer
token . '
at once they went on again . they crossed the bridge in safety [???] hearing
no sound but the water [???] against its three great arches . a mile
further on they came to a narrow ravine that led away northwards through the
steep lands on the left of the road . here strider turned aside [???] and soon
they were lost in a [???] country of dark trees winding among the feet of
sullen hills .
the [???] were glad to leave the cheerless lands and the perilous
road behind them ; but this new country seemed threatening and [???] . as
they went forward the hills about them steadily rose . here and there upon
heights and ridges they caught [???] of ancient walls of stone [???] and the
ruins of towers : they had an [???] look . [???] [???] who was not walking [???] had

time to gaze ahead and to think . he recalled [???] ' s account of his journey
and the threatening towers on the hills north of the road [???] in the country
near the troll ' s wood where his first serious adventure had happened . [???]
guessed that they were now in the same region [???] and wondered if by chance
they would pass near the spot .
' who lives in this land ? ' he asked . ' and who built these towers ? is
this troll - country ? '
' no ! ' said strider . ' [???] do not build . no one lives in this land .
men once dwelt here [???] ages ago ; but none remain now . they became an evil
people [???] as [???] tell [???] for they fell under the shadow of [???] . but all
were destroyed in the war that brought the north kingdom to its end . but
that is now so long ago that the hills have forgotten them [???] though a shadow
still lies on the land . '
' where did you learn such tales [???] if all the land is empty and
forgetful ? ' asked [???] . ' the birds and beasts do not tell tales of that
son . '
' the heirs of [???] do not forget all things past [???] ' said strider ;
' and many more things than i can tell are remembered in [???] . ' ' have
you often been to [???] ? ' said [???] . ' i have [???] ' said strider . ' i dwelt
there once [???] and still i return when i may .
there my heart is ; but it is not my fate to sit in peace [???] even in the
fair house of [???] . '
the hills now began to shut them in . the road behind held on its way to
the river [???] [???] but both were now hidden from view . the travellers came
into a long valley ; narrow [???] deeply cloven [???] dark and silent . trees with old
and twisted roots hung over cliffs [???] and piled up behind into mounting [???]
of pine - wood .
the [???] grew very weary . they advanced slowly [???] for they had to pick
their way through a pathless country [???] [???] by fallen trees and tumbled
rocks . as long as they could they avoided climbing for [???] ' s sake [???] and
because it was in fact difficult to find any way up out of the narrow dales .
they had been two days in this country when the weather turned wet . the wind
began to blow steadily out of the west and pour the water of the distant
seas on the dark heads of the hills in fine drenching rain . by nightfall
they were all soaked [???] and their camp was cheerless [???] for they could not get
any fire to burn . the next day the hills rose still higher and steeper
before them [???] and they were forced to turn away northwards out of their

course . strider seemed to be getting anxious : they were nearly ten days out
from [???] [???] and their stock of provisions was beginning to run low . it
went on raining .
that night they camped on a stony shelf with a rock - wall behind them [???]
in which there was a shallow cave [???] a mere scoop in the cliff . [???] was
restless . the cold and wet had made his wound more painful than ever [???] and
the ache and sense of deadly chill took away all sleep . he lay tossing and
turning and listening fearfully to the [???] night - noises : wind in chinks
of rock [???] water dripping [???] a crack [???] the sudden rattling fall of a loosened
stone . he felt that black shapes were advancing to smother him ; but when he
sat up he saw nothing but the back of strider sitting hunched up [???] smoking
his pipe [???] and watching . he lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream [???]
in which he walked on the grass in his garden in the shire [???] but it seemed
faint and dim [???] less clear than the tall black shadows that stood looking
over the hedge .
in the morning he woke to find that the rain had stopped . the clouds
were still thick [???] but they were breaking [???] and pale strips of blue appeared
between them . the wind was shifting again . they did not start early .
immediately after their cold and comfortless breakfast strider went off
alone [???] telling the others to remain under the shelter of the cliff [???] until he
came back . he was going to climb up [???] if he could [???] and get a look at the lie
of the land .
when he returned he was not [???] . ' we have come too far to the
north [???] ' he said [???] ' and we must find some way to turn back southwards again .
if we keep on as we are going we shall get up into the [???] far north
of [???] . that is troll - country [???] and little known to me . we could
perhaps find our way through and come round to [???] from the north ; but
it would take too long [???] for i do not know the way [???] and our food would not
last . so somehow or other we must find the ford of [???] . '
the rest of that day they spent [???] over rocky ground . they
found a passage between two hills that led them into a valley running
south - east [???] the direction that they wished to take ; but towards the end of
the day they found their road again barred by a ridge of high land ; its dark
edge against the sky was broken into many bare points like teeth of a
blunted saw . they had a choice between going back or climbing over it .
they decided to attempt the climb [???] but it proved very difficult . before
long [???] was obliged to dismount and struggle along on foot . even so they

often despaired of getting their pony up [???] or indeed of finding a path for
themselves [???] burdened as they were . the light was nearly gone [???] and they were
all exhausted [???] when at last they reached the top . they had climbed on to a
narrow saddle between two higher points [???] and the land fell steeply away
again [???] only a short distance ahead . [???] threw himself down [???] and lay on the
ground shivering . his left arm was lifeless [???] and his side and shoulder felt
as if icy claws were laid upon them . the trees and rocks about him seemed
shadowy and dim .
' we cannot go any further [???] ' said merry to strider . ' i am afraid this
has been too much for [???] . i am dreadfully anxious about him . what are we
to do ? do you think they will be able to cure him in [???] [???] if we ever
get there ? '
' we shall see [???] ' answered strider . ' there is nothing more that i can do
in the wilderness ; and it is chiefly because of his wound that i am so
anxious to press on . but i agree that we can go no further tonight . '
' what is the matter with my master ? ' asked sam in a low voice [???] looking
appealingly at strider . ' his wound was small [???] and it is already closed .
there ' s nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on his shoulder . '
' [???] has been touched by the weapons of the enemy [???] ' said strider [???]
' and there is some poison or evil at work that is beyond my skill to drive
out . but do not give up hope [???] sam ! '
night was cold up on the high ridge . they lit a small fire down under
the [???] roots of an old pine [???] that hung over a shallow pit : it looked as
if stone had once been quarried there . they sat [???] together . the wind
blew chill through the pass [???] and they heard the tree - tops lower down moaning
and sighing . [???] lay half in a dream [???] imagining that endless dark wings
were sweeping by above him [???] and that on the wings rode pursuers that sought
him in all the hollows of the hills .
the morning [???] bright and fair ; the air was clean [???] and the light
pale and clear in a rain - washed sky . their hearts were encouraged [???] but ( hey
longed for the sun to warm their cold stiff limbs . as soon as it was light [???]
strider took merry with him and went to survey the country from the height
to the east of the pass . the sun had risen and was shining brightly when he
returned with more comforting news . they were now going more or less in the
right direction . if they went on [???] down the further side of the ridge [???] they
would have the mountains on their left . some way ahead strider had caught a
glimpse of the loudwater again [???] and he knew that [???] though it was hidden from

view [???] the road to the ford was not far from the river and lay on the side
nearest to them .
' we must make for the road again [???] ' he said . ' we cannot hope to find a
path through these hills . whatever danger may beset it [???] the road is our only
way to the ford . '
as soon as they had eaten they set out again . they climbed slowly down
the southern side of the ridge ; but the way was much easier than they had
expected [???] for the slope was far less steep on this side [???] and before long
[???] was able to ride again . bill ferny ' s poor old pony was developing an
unexpected talent for picking out a path [???] and for sparing its rider as many
[???] as possible . the spirits of the party rose again . even [???] felt
better in the morning light [???] but every now and again a mist seemed to
obscure his sight [???] and he pa [???] his hands over his eyes .
[???] was a little ahead of the others . suddenly he turned round and
called to them . ' there is a path here ! ' he cried .
when they came up with him [???] they saw that he had made no mistake :
there were clearly the beginnings of a path [???] that climbed with many
windings out of the woods below and faded away on the hill - top behind . in
places it was now faint and [???] [???] or choked with fallen stones and
trees ; but at one time it seemed to have been much used . it was a path made
by strong arms and heavy feet . here and there old trees had been cut or
broken down [???] and large rocks cloven or heaved aside to make a way .
they followed the track for some while [???] for it offered much the easiest
way down [???] but they went [???] [???] and their anxiety increased as they came
into the dark woods [???] and the path grew plainer and broader . suddenly coming
out of a belt of fir - trees it ran steeply down a slope [???] and turned sharply
to the left round the comer of a rocky shoulder of the hill . when they came
to the comer they looked round and saw that the path ran on over a level
strip under the face of a low cliff [???] with trees . in the stony wall
there was a door hanging crookedly ajar upon one great hinge .
outside the door they all halted . there was a cave or rock - chamber
behind [???] but in the gloom inside nothing could be seen . strider [???] sam [???] and
merry pushing with all their strength managed to open the door a little
wider [???] and then strider and merry went in . they did not go far [???] for on the
floor lay many old bones [???] and nothing else was to be seen near the entrance
except some great empty jars and broken pots .
' surely this is a troll - hole [???] if ever there was one ! ' said [???] .

' come out [???] you two [???] and let us get away . now we know who made the path -
and
we had better get off it quick . '
' there is no need [???] i think [???] ' said strider [???] coining out . ' it is
certainly a troll - hole [???] but it seems to have been long forsaken . i don ' t
think we need be afraid . but let us go on down warily [???] and we shall see . '
the path went on again from the door [???] and turning to the right again
across the level space [???] down a thick wooded slope . [???] [???] not liking
to show strider that he was still afraid [???] went on ahead with merry . sam and
strider came behind [???] one on each side of [???] ' s pony [???] for the path was now
broad enough for four or five [???] to walk [???] . but they had not gone
very far before [???] came running back [???] fol lowed by merry . they both
looked terrified .
' there are [???] ! ' [???] panted . ' down in a clearing in the woods not
far below . we got a sight of them through the tree - trunks . they are very
large ! '
' we will come and look at them [???] ' said strider [???] picking up a stick .
[???] said nothing [???] but sam looked scared .
the sun was now high [???] and it shone down through the half - stripped
branches of the trees [???] and lit the clearing with bright patches of light .
they halted suddenly on the edge [???] and peered through the tree - trunks [???]
holding their breath . there stood the [???] : three large [???] . one was
stooping [???] and the other two stood staring at him .
strider walked forward [???] . ' get up [???] old stone ! ' he said [???] and
brok e his stick upon the stooping troll .
nothing happened . there was a gasp of astonishment from the [???] [???]
and then even [???] laughed . ' well ! ' he said . ' we are forgetting our family
history ! these must be the very three that were caught by [???] [???]
quarrelling over the right way to cook thirteen [???] and one hobbit . '
' i had no idea we were anywhere near the place ! ' said [???] . he knew
the story well . [???] and [???] had told it often ; but as a matter of fact
he had never mor e than half believed it . even now he looked at the stone
[???] with suspicion [???] wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring them
to life again .
' you are forgetting not only your family history [???] but all you ever knew
about [???] [???] ' said strider . ' it is broad daylight with a bright sun [???] and
yet you come back trying to scare me with a tale of live [???] waiting for

us in this glade ! in any case you might have noticed that one of them has an
old bird ' s nest behind his ear . that would be a most unusual ornament for a
live troll ! '
they all laughed . [???] felt his spirits reviving : the reminder of
[???] ' s first successful adventure was heartening . the sun [???] too [???] was warm
and comforting [???] and the mist before his eyes seemed to be lifting a little .
they rested for some time in the glade [???] and took their mid - day meal right
under the shadow of the [???] ' large legs .
' won ' t somebody give us a bit of a song [???] while the sun is high ? ' said
merry [???] when they had finished . ' we haven ' t ha d a song or a tale for days . '
' not since [???] [???] ' said [???] . the others looked at him . ' don ' t
worry about me ! ' he added . ' i feel much better [???] but i don ' t think i could
sing . perhaps sam could dig something out of his memory . '
' come on [???] sam ! ' said merry . ' there ' s more stored in your head than you
let on about . '
' i don ' t know about that [???] ' said sam . ' but how would this suit ? it ain ' t
what i call proper poetry [???] if you understand me : just a bit of nonsense . but
these old images here brought it to my mind . ' standing up [???] with his hands
behind his back [???] as if he was at school [???] he began to sing to an old tune .
troll sat alone on his seat of stone [???]
and [???] and mumbled a bare old bone ;
for many a year he had gnawed it near [???]
for meat was hard to come by .
done by ! gum by !
in a case in the hills he dwelt alone [???]
and meat was hard to come by .

up came tom with his big boots on .
said he to troll : ' pray [???] what is yon ?
for it looks like the shin o ' my nuncle tim [???]
as should be a - lyin ' in graveyard .
caveyard ! paveyard !
this many a year has tim been gone [???]
and i thought he were lyin ' in graveyard . '

' my lad [???] ' said troll [???] ' this bone i stole .
but what be bones that lie in a hole ?

thy nuncle was dead as a lump o ' lead [???]
afore i found his [???] .
[???] ! [???] !
he can spare a share for a poor old troll [???]
for he don ' t need his [???] . '

said tom : ' i don ' t see why the likes o ' thee
without axin ' leave should go makin ' free
with the shank or the shin o ' my father ' s kin ;
so hand the old bone over !
rover ! trover !
though dead he be [???] it belongs to he ;
so hand the old bone over ! '

' for a couple o ' pins [???] ' says troll [???] and grins [???]
' i ' ll eat thee too [???] and gnaw thy shins .
a bit o ' fresh meal will go down sweet !
i ' ll try my teeth on thee now .
hee now ! see now !
i ' m tired o ' gnawing old bones and skins ;
i ' ve a mind to dine on thee now . '

but just as he thought his dinner was caught [???]
he found his hands had hold of naught .
before he could mind [???] tom slipped behind
and gave him the boot to larn him .
warn him ! darn him !
a bump o ' the boot on the seat [???] tom thought [???]
would be the way to larn him .

but harder than stone is the flesh and bone
of a troll that sits in the hills alone .
as well set your boot to the mountain ' s root [???]
for the seat of a troll don ' t feel it .
peel it ! heal it !
old troll laughed [???] when he heard tom groan [???]
and he knew his toes could feel it .


tom ' s leg is game [???] since home he came [???]
and his bootless foot is lasting lame ;
but troll don ' t care [???] and he ' s still there
with the bone he boned from its owner .
doner ! boner !
troll ' s old seat is still the same [???]
and the bone he boned from its owner !
' well [???] that ' s a warning to us all ! ' laughed merry . ' it is as well you
used a stick [???] and not your hand [???] strider ! '
' where did you come by tha t [???] sam ? ' asked [???] . ' i ' ve never heard
those words before . '
sam muttered something [???] . ' it ' s out of his own head [???] of
course [???] ' said [???] . ' i am learning a lot about sam [???] on this journey .
first he was a conspirator [???] now he ' s a jester . he ' ll end up by becoming a
[???] - or a warrior ! '
' i hope not [???] ' said sam . ' i don ' t want to be neither ! '
in the afternoon they went on down the woods . they were probably
following the very track that [???] [???] [???] [???] and the [???] had used many
years before . after a few miles they came out on the top of a high bank
above the road . at this point the road had left the [???] far behind in
its narrow valley [???] and now clung close to the feet of the hills [???] rolling and
winding eastward among woods and heather - covered [???] towards the ford
and
the mountains . not far down the bank strider pointed out a stone in the
grass . on it roughly cut and now much weathered could still be seen
dwarf - runes and secret marks .
' there ! ' said merry . ' that must be the stone that marked the place
where the [???] ' gold was hidden . how much is left of [???] ' s share [???] i
wonder [???] [???] ? '
[???] looked at the stone [???] and wished that [???] had brought home no
treasure more perilous [???] nor less easy to pan with . ' none at all [???] ' he said .
' [???] gave it all away . he told me he did not feel it was really his [???] as it
came from robbers . '
the road lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening . there was
no sign of any other travellers to be seen . as there was now no other
possible course for them to take [???] they climbed down the bank [???] and turning

left went off as fast as they could . soon a shoulder of the hills cut off
the light of the fast westering sun . a cold wind flowed down to meet them
from the mountains ahead .
they were beginning to look out for a place off the road [???] where they
could camp for the night [???] when they heard a sound that brought sudden fear
back into their hearts : the noise of [???] behind them . they looked back [???]
but they could not see far because of the many windings and rollings of the
road . as quickly as they could they [???] off the beaten way and up into
the deep heather and [???] [???] on the [???] above [???] u ntil they came
to a small patch of thick - growing hazels . as they peered out from among the
bushes [???] they could see the road [???] faint and grey in the failing light [???] some
thirty feel below them . the sound of [???] drew nearer . they were going
fast [???] with a light [???] - [???] - clip . then faintly [???] as if it was blown
away from them by the breeze [???] they seemed to catch a dim ringing [???] as of
small bells tinkling .
' that does not sound like a black rider ' s horse ! ' said [???] [???] listening
intently . the other [???] agreed hopefully that it did not [???] but they all
remained full of suspicion . they had been in fear of pursuit for so long
that any sound from behind seemed [???] and [???] . but strider was
now leaning forward [???] stooped to the ground [???] with a hand to his ear [???] and a
look of joy on his face .
the light faded [???] and the leaves on the bushes rustled softly . clearer
and nearer now the bells [???] [???] and [???] - clip came the quick trotting
feet . suddenly into view below came a white horse [???] gleaming in the shadows [???]
running swiftly . in the [???] its [???] [???] and flashed [???] as if it
were studded with gems like living stars . the rider ' s cloak streamed behind
him [???] and his hood was thrown back ; his golden hair flowed [???] in the
wind of his speed . to [???] it appeared that a white light was shining
through the form and raiment of the rider [???] as if through a thin veil .
strider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the road [???] leaping
with a cry through the heather ; but even before he had moved or called [???] the
rider had reined in his horse and halted [???] looking up towards the thicket
where they stood . when he saw strider [???] he [???] and ran to meet him
calling out : ai na [???] d [???] [???] ! mae [???] ! his speech and clear
ringing
voice left no doubt in their hearts : the rider was of the elven - folk . no
others that dwelt in the wide world had voices so fair to hear . but there

seemed to be a note of haste or fear in his call [???] and they saw tha t he was
now speaking quickly and urgently to strider .
soon strider beckoned to them [???] and the [???] left the bushes and
hurried down to the road . ' this is [???] [???] who dwells in the house of
[???] [???] ' said strider .
' hail [???] and well met at last ! ' said the elf - lord to [???] . ' i was sent
from [???] to look for you . we feared that you were in danger upon the
road . '
' then [???] has reached [???] ? ' cried [???] joyfully .
' no . he had not when i departed ; but that was nine days ago [???] ' answered
[???] . ' [???] received news that troubled him . some of my kindred [???]
journeying in your land beyond the [???] [???] * learned that things were
amiss [???] and sent messages as swiftly as they could . they said that the nine
were abroad [???] and that you were [???] bearing a great burden without
[???] [???] for [???] had not returned . there are few even in [???] that
can ride openly against the nine ; but such as there were [???] [???] sent out
north [???] west [???] and south . it was thought that you might turn far aside to
avoid pursuit [???] and become lost in the wilderness .
' it was my lot to take the road [???] and i came to the bridge of
[???] [???] and left a token there [???] nigh on seven days ago . three of the
servants of [???] were upon the bridge [???] but they withdrew and i pursued
them westward . i came also upon two others [???] but they turned away southward .
since then i have searched for your trail . two days ago i found it [???] and
followed it over the bridge ; and today i marked where you descended from the
hills again . but come ! there is no time for further news . since you are here
we must risk the peril of the road and go . there are five behind us [???] and
when they find your trail upon the road they will ride after us like the
wind . and they are not all . where the other four may be [???] i do not know . i
fear that we may find the ford is already held against us . '
while [???] was speaking the shades of evening deepened . [???]
felt a great weariness come over him . ever since the sun began to sink the
mist before his eyes had darkened [???] and he felt that a shadow was coming
between him and the faces of his friends . now pain assailed him [???] and he felt
cold . he swayed [???] clutching at sam ' s arm .
' my master is sick and wounded [???] ' said sam angrily . ' he can ' t go on
riding after nightfall . he needs rest . '
[???] caught [???] as he sank to the ground [???] and taking him gently

in his arms he looked in his face with grave anxiety .
briefly strider told of the attack on their camp under [???] [???] and
of the deadly knife . he drew out the hilt [???] which he had kept [???] and handed it
to the elf . [???] [???] as he took it [???] but he looked intently at
it .
' there are evil things written on this hilt [???] ' he said ; ' though maybe
your eyes cannot see them . keep it [???] [???] [???] till we reach the house of
[???] ! but be wary [???] and handle it as little as you may ! alas ! the wounds of
this weapon are beyond my skill to heal . i will do what i can - but all the
more do i urge you now to go on without rest . '
he searched the wound on [???] ' s shoulder with his fingers [???] and his
face grew graver [???] as if what he learned [???] him . but [???] felt the
chill lessen in his side and arm ; a little warmth crept down from his
shoulder to his hand [???] and the pain grew easier . the [???] of evening seemed
to grow lighter about him [???] as if a cloud had been withdrawn . he saw his
friends ' faces more clearly again [???] and a measure of new hope and strength
returned .
' you shall ride my horse [???] ' said [???] . ' i will shorten the
[???] up to the saddle - skins [???] and you must sit as tight as you can . but
you need not fear : my horse will not let any rider fall that i command him
to bear . his pace is light and smooth ; and if danger presses too near [???] he
will bear you away with a speed that even the black steeds of the enemy
cannot rival . '
' no [???] he will not ! ' said [???] . ' i shall not ride him [???] if i am to be
carried off to [???] or anywhere else [???] leaving my friends behind in
danger . '
[???] smiled . ' i doubt very much [???] ' he said [???] ' if your friends would
be in danger if you were not with them ! the pursuit would follow you and
leave us in peace [???] i think . it is you [???] [???] [???] and that which you bear that
brings us all in peril . '
to that [???] had no answer [???] and he was persuaded to mount [???] ' s
white horse . the pony was laden instead with a great part of the others '
burdens [???] so that they now marched lighter [???] and for a time made good speed ;
but the [???] began to find it hard to keep up with the swift tireless
feet of the elf . on he led them [???] into the mouth of darkness [???] and still on
under the deep clouded night . there was neither star nor moon . not until the
grey of dawn did he allow them to halt . [???] [???] merry [???] and sam were by that

time nearly asleep on their stumbling legs ; and even strider seemed by the
sag of his shoulders to be weary . [???] sat upon the horse in a dark dream .
they cast themselves down in the heather a few yards from the
road - side [???] and fell asleep immediately . they seemed hardly to have closed
their eyes when [???] [???] who had set himself to watch while they slept [???]
awoke them again . the sun had now climbed far into the morning [???] and the
clouds and mists of the night were gone .
' drink this ! ' said [???] to them [???] pouring for each in turn a
little liquor from his silver - studded flask of leather . it was clear as
spring water and had no taste [???] and it did not feel either cool or warm in
the mouth ; but strength and vigour seemed to flow into all their limbs as
they drank it . eaten after that draught the stale bread and dried fruit
( which was now all that they had left ) seemed to satisfy their hunger better
than many a good breakfast in the shire had done .
they had rested rather less than five hours when they took to the road
again . [???] still urged them on [???] and only allowed two brief halts
during the day ' s march . in this way they covered almost twenty miles before
nightfall [???] and came to a point where the road bent right and ran down
towards the bottom of the valley [???] now making straight for the [???] . so
far there had been no sign or sound of pursuit that the [???] could see or
hear ; but often [???] would halt and listen for a moment [???] if they
lagged behind [???] and a look of anxiety clouded his face . once or twice he
spoke to strider in the elf - tongue .
but however anxious their guides might be [???] it was plain that the
[???] could go no further that night . they were stumbling along [???] with
weariness [???] and unable to think of anything but their feet and legs . [???] ' s
pain had [???] [???] and during the day things about him faded to shadows of
ghostly grey . he almost welcomed the coming of night [???] for then the world
seemed less pale and empty .
the [???] were still weary [???] when they set out again early next
morning . there were many miles yet to go between them and the ford [???] and
they
hobbled forward at the best pace they could manage .
' our peril will be greatest just ere we reach the river [???] ' said
[???] ; ' for my heart warns me that the pursuit is now swift behind us [???]
and other danger may be waiting by the ford . '
the road was still running steadily [???] [???] and there was now in

places much grass at either side [???] in which the [???] walked when they
could [???] to ease their tired feet . in the late afternoon they came to a place
where the road went suddenly under the dark shadow of tall pine - trees [???] and
then [???] into a deep cutting with steep moist walls of red stone . echoes
ran along as they hurried forward ; and there seemed to be a sound of many
[???] following their own . all at once [???] as if through a gate of light [???]
the road ran out again from the end of the tunnel into the open . there at
the bottom of a sharp incline they saw before them a long flat mile [???] and
beyond that the ford of [???] . on the further side was a steep brown
bank [???] threaded by a winding path ; and behind that the tall mountains
climbed [???] shoulder above shoulder [???] and peak beyond peak [???] into the fading sky .
there was still an echo as of following feet in the cutting behind
them ; a rushing noise as if a wind were rising and pouring through the
branches of the pines . one moment [???] turned and listened [???] then he
sprang forward with a loud cry .
' fly ! ' he called . ' fly ! the enemy is upon us ! '
the white horse leaped forward . the [???] ran down the slope .
[???] and strider followed as rear - guard . they were only half way
across the flat [???] when suddenly there was a noise of horses [???] . out of
the gate in the trees that they had just left rode a black rider . he reined
his horse in [???] and halted [???] swaying in his saddle . another followed him [???] and
then another ; then again two more .
' ride forward ! ride ! ' cried [???] to [???] .
he did not obey at once [???] for a strange [???] seized him . checking
the horse to a walk [???] he turned and looked back . the riders seemed to sit
upon their great steeds like threatening statues upon a hill [???] dark and
solid [???] while all the woods and land about them receded as if into a mist .
suddenly he knew in his heart that they were silently commanding him to
wait . then at once fear and hatred awoke in him . his hand left the bridle
and gripped the hilt of his sword [???] and with a red flash he drew it .
' ride on ! ride on ! ' cried [???] [???] and then loud and clear he called
to the horse in the elf - tongue : noro lim [???] noro lim [???] [???] !
at once the white horse sprang away and sped like the wind along the
last lap of the road . at the same moment the black horses leaped down the
hill in pursuit [???] and from the riders came a terrible cry [???] such as [???] had
heard filling the woods with horror in the [???] far away . it was
answered ; and to the dismay of [???] and his friends out from the trees and

rocks away on the left four other riders came flying . two rode towards
[???] : two [???] madly towards the ford to cut off his escape . they
seemed to him to run like the wind and to grow swiftly larger and darker [???] as
their courses [???] with his .
[???] looked back for a moment over his shoulder . he could no longer
see his friends . the riders behind were falling back : even their great
steeds were no match in speed for the white elf - horse of [???] . he
looked forward again [???] and hope fa ded . there seemed no chance of reaching the
ford before he was cut off by the others that had lain in ambush . he could
see them clearly now : they appeared to have cast aside their hoods and black
cloaks [???] and they were robed in white and grey . swords were naked in their
pale hands ; helms were on their heads . their cold eyes glittered [???] and they
called to him with fell voices .
fear now filled all [???] ' s mind . he thought no longer of his sword . no
cry came from him . he shut his eyes and clung to the horse ' s mane . the wind
whistled in his ears [???] and the bells upon the harness rang wild and shrill . a
breath of deadly cold pierced him like a spear [???] as with a last spurt [???] like a
flash of white fire [???] the elf - horse speeding as if on wings [???] passed right
before the face of the foremost rider .
[???] heard the splash of water . it foamed about his feet . he felt the
quick heave and surge as the horse left the river and struggled up the stony
path . he was climbing the steep bank . he was across the ford .
but the pursuers were close behind . at the top of the bank the horse
halted and turned about neighing fiercely . there were nine riders at the
water ' s edge below [???] and [???] ' s spirit [???] before the threat of their
[???] faces . he knew of nothing that would prevent them from crossing as
easily as he had done ; and he felt that it was useless to try to escape over
the long uncertain path from the ford to the edge of [???] [???] if once the
riders crossed . in any case he felt that he was commanded urgently to halt .
hatred again stirred in him [???] but he had no longer the strength to refuse .
suddenly the foremost rider spurred his horse forward . it checked at
the water and reared up . with a great effort [???] sat upright and
brandished his sword .
' go back ! ' he cried . ' go back to the land of [???] [???] and follow me no
more ! ' his voice sounded thin and shrill in his own ears . the riders
halted [???] but [???] had not the power of [???] . his enemies laughed at him
with a harsh and chilling laughter . ' come back ! come back ! ' they called . ' to

[???] we will take you ! '
' go back ! ' he whispered .
' the ring ! the ring ! ' they cried with deadly voices ; and immediately
their leader urged his horse forward into the water [???] followed closely by two
others .
' by [???] and l [???] thien the fair [???] ' said [???] with a last effort [???]
lifting up his sword [???] ' you shall have neither the ring nor me ! '
then the leader [???] who was now half across the ford [???] stood up [???] in
his [???] [???] and raised up his hand . [???] was [???] dumb . he felt his
tongue cleave to his mouth [???] and his heart labouring . his sword broke and
fell out of his shaking hand . the elf - horse reared and snorted . the foremost
of the black horses had almost set foot upon the shore .
at that moment there came a roaring and a rushing : a noise of loud
waters rolling many stones . dimly [???] saw the river below him rise [???] and
down along its course there came a plumed [???] of waves . white flames
seemed to [???] to [???] on their crests and he half fancied that he saw
amid the water white riders upon white horses with frothing manes . the three
riders that were still in the midst of the ford were overwhelmed : they
disappeared [???] buried su [???] under angry foam . those that were behind drew
back in dismay .
with his last failing senses [???] heard cries [???] and it seemed to him
that he saw [???] beyond the riders that [???] on the shore [???] a shining figure
of white light ; and behind it ran small shadowy forms waving flames [???] that
flared red in the grey mist that was falling over the world .
the black horses were filled with madness [???] and leaping forward in
terror they bore their riders into the rushing flood . their piercing cries
were drowned in the roaring of the river as it carried them away . then [???]
felt himself falling [???] and the roaring and confusion seemed to rise and
engulf him together with his enemies . he heard and saw no more .


* book ii *




chapter 1 . many meetings



[???] woke and found himself lying in bed . at first he thought that he
had slept late [???] after a long [???] dream that still hovered on the edge
of memory . or perhaps he had been ill ? but the ceiling looked strange ; it
was flat [???] and it had dark beams richly carved . he lay a little while longer
looking at patches of sunlight on the wall [???] and listening to the sound of a
waterfall .
` where am i [???] and what is the time ? ' he said aloud to the ceiling . ' in
the house of [???] [???] and it is ten o ' clock in the morning . ' said a voice .
` it is the morning of [???] the twenty - fourth [???] if you want to know . '
` [???] ! ' cried [???] [???] sitting up . there was the old [???] [???] sitting
in a chair by the open window .
` yes [???] ' he said [???] ` i am here . and you are lucky to be here [???] too [???] after
all the absurd things you have done since you left home . ' [???] lay down
again . he felt too comfortable and peaceful to argue [???] and in any case he did
not think he would get the better of an argument . he was fully awake now [???]
and the memory of his journey was returning : the [???] ` short cut '
through the old forest the ` accident ' at the prancing pony ; and his madness
in putting on the ring in the dell under [???] . while he was thinking
of all these things and trying in vain to bring his memory down to his
arriving in [???] [???] there was a long silence [???] broken only by the soft
puffs of [???] ' s pipe [???] as he blew white smoke - rings out of the window .
' where ' s sam ? ' [???] asked at length . ' and are the others all right ? '
' yes [???] they are all safe and sound [???] ' answered [???] . ` sam was here
until i sent him off to get some rest [???] about half an hour ago . '
` what happened at the ford ? ' said [???] . ` it all seemed so dim somehow ;
and it still does . '
' yes [???] it would . you were beginning to fade [???] ' answered [???] . ' the
wound was [???] you at last . a few more hours and you would have
been
beyond our aid . but you have some strength in you [???] my dear hobbit ! as you
showed in the barrow . that was touch and go : perhaps the most dangerous

moment of all . i wish you could have held out at [???] . '
' you seem to know a great deal already [???] ' said [???] . ` i have not spoken
to the others about the barrow . at first it was too horrible ; and afterwards
there were other things to think about . how do you know about it ? '
' you have talked long in your sleep [???] [???] [???] ' said [???] gently [???] ' and
it has not been hard for me to read your mind and memory . do not worry !
though i said [???] absurd [???] just now [???] i did not mean it . i think well of you - and
of the others . it is no small feat to have come so far [???] and through such
dangers [???] still bearing the ring . '
' we should never have done it without strider [???] ' said [???] . ` but we
needed you . i did not know what to do without you . '
' i was delayed [???] ' said [???] [???] ` and that nearly proved our ruin . and
yet i am not sure ; it may have been better so . '
' i wish you would tell me what happened ! '
' all in good time ! you are not supposed to talk or worry about anything
today [???] by [???] ' s orders . '
` but talking would stop me thinking and wondering [???] which are quite as
tiring [???] ' said [???] . ' i am wide awake now [???] and i remember so many things
that want explaining . why were you delayed ? you ought to tell me that at
least . '
' you will soon hear all you wish to know [???] ' said [???] . ' we shall have
a council [???] as soon as you are well enough . at the moment i will only say
that i was held captive . '
' you ? ' cried [???] .
' yes [???] i [???] [???] the grey [???] ' said the [???] solemnly . ' there are many
powers in the world [???] for good or for evil . some are greater than i am .
against some i have not yet been measured . but my time is coming . the
[???] - lord and his black riders have come forth . war is preparing ! '
` then you knew of the riders already - before i met them ? '
' yes [???] i knew of them . indeed i spoke of them once to you ; for the black
riders are the [???] [???] the nine servants of the lord of the rings . but
i did not know that they had arisen again or i should have fled with you at
once . i heard news of them only after i left you in june ; but that story
must wait . for the moment we have been saved from disaster [???] by [???] . '
' yes [???] ' said [???] [???] ` it was strider that saved us . yet i was afraid of
him at first . sam never quite trusted him . i think [???] not at any rate until we
met [???] . '

[???] smiled . ` i have heard all about sam [???] ' he said . ' he has no more
doubts now . '
' i am glad [???] ' said [???] . ' for i have become very fond of strider . well [???]
fond is not the right word . i mean he is dear to me ; though he is strange [???]
and grim at times . in fact [???] he reminds me often of you . i didn ' t know that
any of the big people were like that . i thought [???] well [???] that they were just
big [???] and rather stupid : kind and stupid like [???] ; or stupid and wicked
like bill ferny . but then we don ' t know much about men in the shire [???] except
perhaps the [???] . '
` you don ' t know much even about them [???] if you think old [???] is
stupid [???] ' said [???] . ' he is wise enough on his own ground . he thinks less
than he talks [???] and slower ; yet he can see through a brick wall in time ( as
they say in bree ) . but there are few left in middle - earth like [???] son
of [???] . the race of the kings from over the sea is nearly at an end . it
may be that this war of the ring will be their last adventure . '
' do you really mean that strider is one of the people of the old
kings ? ' said [???] in wonder . ` i thought they had all vanished long ago . i
thought he was only a ranger . '
' only a ranger ! ' cried [???] . ` my dear [???] [???] that is just what the
rangers are : the last [???] in the north of the great people [???] the men of
the west . they have helped me before ; and i shall need their help in the
days to come ; for we have reached [???] [???] but the ring is not yet at
rest . '
' i suppose not [???] ' said [???] . ' but so far my only thought has been to
get here ; and i hope i shan ' t have to go any further . it is very pleasant
just to rest . i have had a month of exile and adventure [???] and i find that has
been as much as i want . '
he fell silent and shut his eyes . after a while he spoke again . ' i have
been reckoning [???] ' he said [???] ` and i can ' t bring the total up to [???] the
twenty - fourth . it ought to be the twenty - first . we must have reached the
ford by the twentieth . '
' you have talked and reckoned more than is good for you [???] ' said [???] .
` how do the side and shou lder feel now ? '
' i don ' t know . ' [???] answered . ' they don ' t feel at all : which is an
[???] [???] but ' - - he made an effort - - ' i can move my arm again a little .
yes [???] it is coming back to life . it is not cold [???] ' he added [???] touching his left
hand with his right .

` good ! ' said [???] . ` it is mending fast . you will soon be sound
again . [???] has cured you : he has tended you for days [???] ever since you were
brought in . '
' days ? ' said [???] .
` well [???] four nights and three days [???] to be exact . the elves brought you
from this where you lost count . we have been terribly anxious [???] and sam has
hardly left your side [???] day or night [???] except to run messages . [???] is a
master of healing [???] but the weapons of our enemy are deadly . to tell you the
truth [???] i had very little hope ; for i suspected that there was some fragment
of the blade still in the closed wound . but it could not be found until last
night . then [???] removed a splinter . it was deeply buried . and it was
working inwards . '
[???] [???] [???] remembering the cruel knife with notched blade that
had vanished in strider ' s hands . ` don ' t be alarmed ! ' said [???] . ` it is
gone now . it has been melted . and it seems that [???] fade very
[???] . i have known strong warriors of the big people who would
quickly have been overcome by that splinter [???] which you bore for seventeen
days . '
` what would they have done to me ? ' asked [???] . ` what were the riders
trying to do ? '
' they tried to pierce your heart with a [???] - knife which remains in
the wound . if they had succeeded [???] you would have become like they are [???] only
weaker and under their command . you would have became a wraith under
the
dominion of the dark lord ; and he would have tormented you for trying to
keep his ring [???] if any greater torment were possible than being robbed of it
and seeing it on his hand . '
' thank goodness i did not realize the horrible danger ! ' said [???]
faintly . i was mortally afraid [???] of course ; but if i had k nown more [???] i should
not have dared even to move . it is a marvel that i escaped ! '
' yes [???] fortune or fate have helped you [???] ' said [???] [???] ` not to mention
courage . for your heart was not touched [???] and only your shoulder was pierced ;
and that was because you resisted to the last . but it was a terribly narrow
shave [???] so to speak . you were in gravest peril while you wore the ring [???] for
then you were half in the wraith - world yourself [???] and they might have seized
you . you could see them [???] and they could see you . '
` i know [???] ' said [???] . ` they were terrible to behold ! but why could we

all see their horses ? '
` because they are real horses ; just as the black robes are real robes
that they wear to give shape to their nothingness when they have dealings
with the living . '
` then why do these black horses endure such riders ? all other animals
are terrified when they draw near [???] even the elf - horse of [???] . the
dogs howl and the geese scream at them . '
` because these horses are born and bred to the service of the dark lord
in [???] . not all his servants and [???] are [???] ! there are [???] and
[???] [???] there are wargs and [???] ; and there have been and still are
many men [???] warriors and kings [???] that walk alive under the sun [???] and yet are
under his sway . and their number is growing daily . '
` what about [???] and the elves ? is [???] safe ? '
` yes [???] at present [???] until all else is conquered . the elves may fear the
dark lord [???] and they may fly before him [???] but never aga in will they listen to
him or serve him . and here in [???] there live still some of his chief
foes : the elven - wise [???] lords of the eldar from beyond the furthest seas . they
do not fear the [???] [???] for those who have dwelt in the blessed realm
live at once in both worlds [???] and against both the seen and the unseen they
have great power . '
' i thought that i saw a white figure that shone and did not grow dim
like the others . was that [???] then ? '
' yes [???] you saw him for a moment as he is upon the other side : one of the
mighty of the firstborn . he is an elf - lord of a house of princes . indeed
there is a power in [???] to withstand the might of [???] [???] for a while :
and elsewhere other powers still dwell . there is power [???] too [???] of another kind
in the shire . but all such places will soon become islands under siege [???] if
things go on as they are going . the dark lord is putting forth all his
strength .
` still [???] ' he said [???] standing suddenly up and sticking out his chin . while
his beard went stiff and straight like [???] wire [???] ` we must keep up our
courage . you will soon be well [???] if i do not talk you to death . you are in
[???] [???] and you need not worry about anything for the present . '
' i haven ' t any courage to keep up [???] ' said [???] [???] ` but i am not worried
at the moment . just give me news of my friends [???] and tell me the end of the
affair at the ford [???] as i keep on asking [???] and i shall be content for the
present . after that i shall have another sleep [???] i think ; but i shan ' t be

able to close my eyes until you have finished the story for me . '
[???] moved his chair to the bedside [???] and took a good look at [???] .
the colour had come back to his face [???] and his eyes were clear [???] and fully
awake and aware . he was smiling [???] and there seemed to be little wrong with
him . but to the [???] ' s eye there was a faint change just a hint as it were
of [???] [???] about him [???] and especially about the left hand that lay
outside upon the coverlet .
` still that must be expected [???] ' said [???] to himself . ` he is not half
through yet [???] and to what he will come in the end not even [???] can
foretell . not to evil [???] i think . he may become like a glass filled with a
clear light for eyes to see that can . '
` you look [???] [???] ' he said aloud . ` i will risk a brief tale without
consulting [???] . but quite brief [???] mind you [???] and then you must sleep again .
this is what happened [???] as far as i can gather . the riders made straight for
you [???] as soon as you fled . they did not need the [???] of their horses any
longer : you had become visible to them [???] being already on the [???] of
their world . and also the ring drew them . your friends sprang aside [???] off the
road [???] or they would have been ridden down . they knew that nothing could save
you [???] if the white horse could not . the riders were too swift to overtake [???]
and too many to oppose . on foot even [???] and [???] together could
not with stand all the nine at once .
` when the [???] swept by [???] your friends ran up behind . close to
the ford there is a small hollow beside the road masked by a few [???]
trees . there they hastily kindled fire ; for [???] knew that a flood
would come down [???] if the riders tried to cross [???] and then he would have to
deal with any that were left on his side of the river . the moment the flood
appeared [???] he rushed out [???] followed by [???] and the . others with flaming
brands . caught between fire and water [???] and seeing an elf - lord revealed in
his wrath [???] they were dismayed [???] and their horses were [???] with madness .
three were carried away by the first assault of the flood ; the others were
now hurled into the water by their horses and overwhelmed . '
' and is that the end of the black riders ? ' asked [???] .
' no [???] ' said [???] . ' their horses must have perished [???] and without them
they are [???] . but the [???] themselves cannot be so easily
destroyed . however [???] there is nothing more to fear from them at present . your
friends crossed after the flood had passed ; and they found you lying on your
face at the top of the bank [???] with a broken sword under you . the horse was

standing guard beside you . you were pale and cold [???] and they feared that you
were dead [???] or worse . [???] ' s folk met them [???] carrying you slowly towards
[???] . '
` who made the flood ? ' asked [???] .
' [???] commanded it [???] ' answered [???] . ` the river of this valley is
under his power [???] and it will rise in anger when he has great need to bar the
ford . as soon as the captain of the [???] rode into the water the
flood was released . if i may say so [???] i added a few touches of my own : you
may not have noticed [???] but some of the waves took the form of great white
horses with shining white riders ; and there wer e many rolling and grinding
[???] . for a moment i was afraid that we had let loose too fierce a
wrath [???] and the flood would get out of hand and wash you all away . there is
great vigour in the waters that come down from the snows of the misty
mountains . '
` yes [???] it all comes back to me now [???] ' said [???] : ' the tremendous
roaring . i thought i was drowning [???] with my friends and enemies and all . but
now we are safe ! '
[???] looked quickly at [???] [???] but he had shut his eyes . ' yes [???] you
are all safe for the present . soon there will be feasting and [???] to
celebrate the victory at the ford of [???] [???] and you will all be there in
places of honour . '
' [???] ! ' said [???] . ` it is wonderful that [???] [???] and [???]
and such great lords [???] not to mention strider [???] should take so much trouble
and show me so much kindness . '
` well [???] there are many reasons why they should [???] ' said [???] [???] smiling .
` i am one good reason . the ring is another : you are the ring - bearer . and you
are the heir of [???] [???] the ring - finder . '
` dear [???] ! ' said [???] sleepily . ` i wonder where he is . i wish he was
here and could hear all about it . it would have made him laugh [???] the cow
jumped over the moon ! and the poor old troll ! ' with that he fell fast
asleep .
[???] was now safe in the last homely house east of the sea . that house
was [???] as [???] had long ago reported [???] ` a perfect house [???] whether you like food
or sleep [???] or story - telling or singing [???] or just sitting and thinking best [???] or
a pleasant mixture of them all ' . merely to be there was a cure for
weariness [???] fear [???] and sadness .
as the evening drew on [???] [???] woke up again [???] and he found that he no

longer felt in need of rest or sleep [???] but had a mind for food and drink [???] and
probably for singing and story - telling afterwards . he got out of bed and
discovered that his arm was already nearly as useful again as it ever had
been . he found laid ready clean garments of green cloth that fitted him
excellently . looking in a mirror he was startled to see a much thinner
reflection of himself than he remembered : it looked remarkably like the
young nephew of [???] who used to go tramping with his uncle in the shire ;
but the eyes looked out at him thoughtfully .
` yes [???] you have seen a thing or two since you last peeped out of a
looking - glass [???] ' he said to his reflection . ' but now for a merry meeting ! '
he stretched out his arms and whistled a tune .
at that moment there was a knock on the door [???] and sam came in . he ran
to [???] and took his left hand [???] [???] and shyly . he stroked it gently
and then he blushed and turned hastily away .
` hullo [???] sam ! ' said [???] .
` it ' s warm ! ' said sam . ` meaning your hand [???] mr . [???] . it has felt so
cold through the long nights . but glory and trumpets ! ' he cried [???] turning
round again with shining eyes and dancing on the floor . ' it ' s fine to see
you up and yourself again [???] sir ! [???] asked me to come and see if you were
ready to come down [???] and i thought he was joking . '
' i am ready [???] ' said [???] . ' let ' s go and look for the rest of the
party ! '
` i can take you to them [???] sir [???] ' said sam . ` it ' s a big house this [???] and
very peculiar . always a bit more to discover [???] and no knowing what you ' ll
find round a corner . and elves [???] sir ! elves here [???] and elves there ! some like
kings [???] terrible and [???] ; and some as merry as children . and the music
and the singing - not that i have had the time or the heart for much listening
since we got here . but i ' m getting to know some of the ways of the place . '
' i know what you have been doing [???] sam [???] ' said [???] [???] taking his arm .
' but you shall be merry tonight [???] and listen to your heart ' s content . come
on [???] guide me round the corners ! '
sam led him along several passages and down many steps and out into a
high garden above the steep bank of the river . he found his friends sitting
in a porch on the side of the house looking east . shadows had fallen in the
valley below [???] but there was still a light on the faces of the mountains far
above . the air was warm . the sound of running and falling water was loud [???]
and the evening was filled with a faint scent of trees and flowers [???] as if

summer still lingered in [???] ' s gardens .
` hurray ! ' cried [???] [???] springing up . ` here is our noble cousin ! make
way for [???] [???] lord of the ring ! '
' hush ! ' said [???] from the shadows at the back of the porch . ` evil
things do not come into this valley ; but all the same we should not name
them . the lord of the ring is not [???] [???] but the master of the dark tower of
[???] [???] whose power is again stretching out over the world ! we are sitting
in a fortress . outside it is getting dark . '
` [???] has been saying many cheerful things like that [???] ' said [???] .
` he thinks i need keeping in order . but it seems impossible [???] somehow [???] to
feel gloomy or depressed in this place . i feel i could sing [???] if i knew the
right song for the occasion . '
` i feel like singing myself [???] ' laughed [???] . ` thou gh at the moment i
feel more like eating and drinking ! '
` that will soon be cured [???] ' said [???] . ` you have shown your usual
cunning in getting up just in time for a meal . '
` more than meal ! a feast ! ' said merry . ` as soon as [???] reported
that you were recovered [???] the preparations began . ' he had hardly finished
speaking when they were summoned to the hall by the ringing of many bells .
the hall of [???] ' s house was filled with folk : elves for the most
part [???] though there wer e a few guests of other sorts . [???] [???] as was his
custom [???] sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dais ; and
next to him on the one side sat [???] [???] on the other side sat [???] .
[???] looked at them in wonder [???] for he had never before seen [???] [???] of
whom so many tales spoke ; and as they sat upon his right hand and his left [???]
[???] [???] and even [???] [???] whom he thought he knew so well [???] were
revealed
as lords of dignity and power . [???] was shorter in stature than the other
two ; but his long white hair [???] his sweeping silver beard [???] and his broad
shoulders [???] made him look like some wise king of ancient legend . in his aged
face under great snowy brows his dark eyes were set like coals that could
leap suddenly into fire .
[???] was tall and straight ; his hair was of shining gold [???] his
face fair and young and fearless and full of joy ; his eyes were bright and
keen [???] and his voice like music ; on his brow sat wisdom [???] and in his hand was
strength .
the face of [???] was ageless [???] neither old nor young [???] though in it was

written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful . his hair was dark
as the shadows of [???] [???] and upon it was set a circlet of silver ; his
eyes were grey as a clear evening [???] and in them was a light like the light of
stars . [???] he seemed as a king crowned with many winters [???] and yet hale
as a tried warrior in the fulness of his strength . he was the lord of
[???] and mighty among both elves and men .
in the middle of the table [???] against the woven cloths upon the wall [???]
there was a chair under a canopy [???] and there sat a lady fair to look upon [???]
and so like was she in form of womanhood to [???] that [???] guessed that
she was one of his close kindred . young she was and yet not so . the braids
of her dark hair were touched by no frost [???] her white arms and clear face
were [???] and smooth [???] and the light of stars was in her bright eyes [???]
grey as a cloudless night ; yet queenly she looked [???] and thought and knowledge
were in her glance [???] as of one who has known many things that the years
bring . above her brow her head was covered with a cap of silver lace netted
with small gems [???] glittering white ; but her soft grey raiment had no ornament
save a girdle of leaves wrought in silver .
so it was that [???] saw her whom few mortals had yet seen ; [???] [???]
daughter of [???] [???] in whom it was said that the likeness of l [???] thien had
come on earth again ; and she was called [???] [???] for she was the [???]
of her people . long she had been in the land of her mother ' s kin [???] in [???]
beyond the mountains [???] and was but lately returned to [???] to her
father ' s house . but her brothers [???] [???] and [???] [???] were out upon
[???] : for they rode often far afield with the rangers of the north [???]
forgetting never their mother ' s torment in the dens of the [???] .
such loveliness in living thing [???] had never seen before nor
imagined in his mind ; and he was both surprised and [???] to find that he
had a seat at [???] ' s table among all these folk so high and fair . though
he had a suitable chair [???] and was raised upon several cushions [???] he felt very
small [???] and rather out of place ; but that feeling quickly passed . the feast
was merry and the food all that his hunger could desire . it was some time
before he looked about him again or even turned to his neighbours .
he looked first for his friends . sam had begged to be allowed to wait
on his master [???] but had been told that for this time he was a guest of
honour . [???] could see him now [???] sitting with [???] and merry at the upper
end of one of the side - tables close to the dais . he could see no sign of
strider .

next to [???] on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance [???] richly
dressed . his beard [???] very long and forked [???] was white [???] nearly as white as the
snow - white cloth of his garments . he wore a silver belt [???] and round his neck
hung a chain of silver and diamonds . [???] stopped eating to look at him .
' welcome and well met ! ' said the dwarf [???] turning towards him . then he
actually rose from his seat and bowed . ` [???] at your service [???] ' he said [???] and
bowed still lower .
' [???] [???] at your service and your family ' s [???] ' said [???]
correctly [???] rising in surprise and scattering his cushions . ' am i right in
guessing that you are the [???] [???] one of the twelve companions of the great
[???] [???] ? '
` quite right [???] ' answered the dwarf [???] gathering up the cushions and
courteously assist ing [???] back into his seat . ' and i do not ask [???] for i
have already been told that you are the kinsman and adopted heir of our
friend [???] the renowned . allow me to [???] you on your recovery . '
` thank you very much [???] ' said [???] .
' you have had some very strange adventures [???] i hear [???] ' said [???] . ' i
wonder greatly what brings four [???] on so long a journey . nothing like
it has happened since [???] came with us . but perhaps i should not inquire
too closely [???] since [???] and [???] do not seem disposed to talk of this ? '
' i think we will not speak of it [???] at least not yet [???] ' said [???]
[???] .
he guessed that even in [???] ' s house the matter of the ring was not
one for casual talk ; and in any case he wished to forget his troubles for a
time . ' but i am equally curious [???] ' he added [???] ` to learn what brings so
important a dwarf so far from the lonely mountain . '
[???] looked at him . ' if you have not heard [???] i think we will not speak
yet of that either . master [???] will summon us all ere long [???] i believe [???]
and then we shall all hear many things . but there is much else that may be
told . '
throughout the rest of the meal they talked together [???] but [???]
listened more than he spoke ; for the news of the shire [???] apart from the ring [???]
seemed small and far - away and [???] . while [???] had much to tell of
events in the northern regions of wilderland . [???] learned that [???]
the old [???] son of beorn [???] was now the lord of many [???] men [???] and to their
land between the mountains and [???] neither orc nor wolf dared to go .
' [???] [???] ' said [???] [???] ` if it were not for the [???] [???] the passage

from dale to [???] would long ago have become impossible . they are
valiant men and keep open the high pass and the ford of [???] . but their
[???] are high [???] ' he added with a shake of his head ; ` and like beorn of old
they are not over fond of [???] . still [???] they are trusty [???] and that is much
in these days . nowhere are there any men so friendly to us as the men of
dale . they are good folk [???] the bardings . the grandson of bard the bowman
rules them [???] brand son of bain son of bard . he is a strong king . and his
realm now reaches far south and east of [???] . '
' and what of your own people ? ' asked [???] .
` there is much to tell [???] good and bad [???] ' said [???] ; ' yet it is mostly
good : we have so far been fortunate [???] though we do not escape the shadow of
these times . if you really wish to hear of us [???] i will tell you tidings
gladly . but stop me when you are weary ! [???] ' tongues run on when
speaking of their [???] [???] they say . '
and with that [???] [???] on a long account of the doings of the
dwarf - kingdom . he was delighted to have found so polite a listener ; for
[???] showed no sign of weariness and made no attempt to change the subject [???]
though actually he soon got rather lost among the strange names of people
and places that he had never heard of before . he was interested [???] however [???] to
hear that [???] was still king under the mountain [???] and was now old ( having
passed his two hundred and [???] year ) [???] [???] [???] and [???] rich .
of the ten companions who had survived the battle of five armies seven were
still with him : [???] [???] [???] [???] dori [???] nori [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] and bombur . bombur
was now so fat that he could not move himself from his couch to his chair at
table [???] and it took six young [???] to lift him .
' and what has become of balin and ori and uin ? ' asked [???] .
a shadow passed over [???] ' s face . ` we do not know [???] ' he answered . ' it
is largely on account of balin that i have come to ask the advice of those
that dwell in [???] . but tonight let us speak of merrier things ! '
[???] began then to talk of the works of his people [???] telling [???]
about their great labours in dale and under the mountain . ' we have done
well [???] ' he said . ` but in metalwork we cannot rival our fathers [???] many of
whose . secrets are lost . we make good armour and keen swords [???] but we cannot
again make mail or blade to match those that were made before the dragon
came . only in mining and building have we [???] the old days . you should
see the waterways of dale [???] [???] [???] and the fountains [???] and the [???] ! you
should see the stone - paved roads of many colours ! and the halls and

[???] streets under the earth with arches carved like trees ; and the
terraces and towers upon the mountain ' s sides ! then you would see that we
have not been idle . '
' i will come and see them [???] if ever i can [???] ' said [???] . ' how surprised
[???] would have been to see all the changes in the desolation of [???] ! '
[???] looked at [???] and smiled . ' you were very fond of [???] were you
not ? ' he asked .
` yes [???] ' answered [???] . ' i would rather see him than all the towers and
palaces in the world . '
at length the feast came to an end . [???] and [???] rose and went down
the hall [???] and the company followed them in due order . the doors were thrown
open [???] and they went across a wide passage and through other doors [???] and came
into a further hall . in it were no tables [???] but a bright fire was burning in
a great hearth between the carven pillars upon either side .
[???] found himself walking with [???] . ` this is the hall of fire '
said the [???] . ` here you will hear many songs and tales - if you can keep
awake . but except on high days it usually stands empty and quiet [???] and people
come here who wish for peace [???] and thought . there is always a fire here [???] all
the year round [???] but there is little other light . '
as [???] entered and went towards the seat prepared for him [???] elvish
[???] began to make sweet music . slowly the hall filled [???] and [???]
looked with delight upon the many fair faces that were gathered together ;
the golden firelight played upon them and [???] in their hair . suddenly
he noticed [???] not far from the further end of the fire [???] a small dark figure
seated on a stool with his back propped against a pillar . beside him on the
ground was a drinking - cup and some bread . [???] wondered whether he was
ill
( if people were ever ill in [???] ) [???] and had been unable to come to the
feast . his head seemed sunk in sleep on his breast [???] and a fold of his dark
cloak was drawn over his face .
[???] wen t forward and stood beside the silent figure . ' awake little
master . he said [???] with a smile . then [???] turning to [???] [???] he beckoned to him .
' now at last the hour has come that you have wished for [???] [???] [???] ' he said .
` here is a friend that you have long missed . '
the dark figure raised its head and uncovered its face .
` [???] ! ' cried [???] with sudden recognition [???] and he sprang forward .
` hullo [???] [???] my lad ! ' said [???] . ` so you have got here at last . i

hoped you would manage it . well [???] well ! so all this feasting is in your
honour [???] i hear . i hope you enjoyed yourself ? '
' why weren ' t you there ? ' cried [???] . ` and why haven ' t i been allowed
to see you before ? '
` because you were asleep . i have seen a good deal of you . i have sat by
your side with sam each day . but as for the feast ` i don ' t go in for such
things much now . and i had something else to do . '
` what were you doing ? '
` why [???] sitting and thinking . i do a lot of that [???] [???] and this is
the best place to do it in [???] as a rule . wake up [???] indeed ! ' he said [???] cocking an
eye at [???] . there was a bright [???] in it and no sign of sleepiness
that [???] could see . ` wake up ! i was not asleep . master [???] . if you want
to know [???] you have all come out from your feast too soon [???] and you have
disturbed me - in the middle of making up a song . i was stuck over a line or
two [???] and was thinking about them ; but now i don ' t suppose i shall ever get
them right . there will be such a deal of singing that the ideas wi ll be
driven clean out of my head . i shall have to get my friend the d [???] [???] to
help me . where is he ? '
[???] laughed . ` he shall be found [???] ' he said . ` then you two shall go
into a corner and finish your task [???] and we will hear it and judge it before
we end our [???] . ' messengers were sent to find [???] ' s friend [???] though
none knew where he was [???] or why he had not been present at the feast .
in the meanwhile [???] and [???] sat side by side [???] and sam came quickly
and placed himself near them . they talked together in soft voices [???] oblivious
of the mirth and music in the hall about them . [???] had not much to say of
himself . when he had left [???] he had wandered off [???] [???] along the
road or in the country on either side ; but somehow he had steered all the
time towards [???] . ` i got here without much adventure [???] ' he said [???] ` and
after a rest i went on with the [???] to dale : my last journey . i shan ' t
travel again . old balin had gone away . then i came back here [???] and here i
have been . i have done this and that . i have written some more of my book .
and [???] of course [???] i make up a few songs . they sing them occasionally : just to
please me [???] i think ; for [???] of course [???] they aren ' t really good enough for
[???] . and i listen and i think . time doesn ' t seem to pass here : it just
is . a remarkable place altogether .
` i hear all kinds of news [???] from over the mountains [???] and out of the
south [???] but hardly anything from the shire . i heard about the ring [???] of

course . [???] has been here often . not that he has told me a great deal [???]
he has become closer than ever these last few years . the d [???] [???] has told me
more . fancy that ring of mine causing such a disturbance ! it is a pity that
[???] did not find out more sooner . i could have brought the thing here
myself long ago without so much trouble . i have thought several times of
going back to [???] for it ; but i am getting old [???] and they would not let
me : [???] and [???] [???] i mean . they seemed to think that the enemy was
looking high and low for me [???] and would make [???] of me [???] if he caught
me
tottering about in the wild .
' and [???] said : [???] the ring has passed on [???] [???] . it would do no good
to you or to others [???] if you tried to meddle with it again . [???] odd sort of
remark [???] just like [???] . but he said he was looking after you [???] so i let
things be . i am frightfully glad to see you safe and sound . ' he paused and
looked at [???] doubtfully .
` have you got it here ? ' he asked in a whisper . ` i ca n ' t help feeling
curious [???] you know [???] after all i ' ve heard . i should very much like just to
peep at it again . '
` yes [???] i ' ve got it [???] ' answered [???] [???] feeling a strange [???] . ` it
looks just the same as ever it did . '
` well [???] i should just lik e to see it for a moment [???] ' said [???] .
when he had dressed [???] [???] found that while he slept the ring had been
hung about his neck on a new chain [???] light but strong . slowly he drew it out .
[???] put out his hand . but [???] quickly drew back the ring . to his
distress and amazement he found that he was no longer looking at [???] ; a
shadow seemed to have fallen between them [???] and through it he found himself
eyeing a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands .
he felt a desire to strike him .
the music and singing round them seemed to falter and a silence fell .
[???] looked quickly at [???] ' s face and passed his hand across his eyes . ` i
understand now [???] ' he said . ` put it away ! i am sorry : sorry you have come in
for this burden : sorry about everything . don ' t adventures ever have an end ?
i suppose not . someone else always has to carry on the story . well [???] it can ' t
be helped . i wonder if it ' s any good trying to finish my book ? but don ' t
let ' s worry about it now - let ' s have some real news ! tell me all about the
shire ! '
[???] hid the ring away [???] and the shadow passed leaving hardly a shred

of memory . the light and music of [???] was about him again . [???]
smiled and laughed happily . every item of news from the shire that [???]
could tell - aided and corrected now and again by sam - was of the greatest
interest to him [???] from the felling of the least tree to the pranks of the
smallest child in [???] . they were so deep in the doings of the four
farthings that they did not notice the arrival of a man clad in dark green
cloth . for many minutes he stood looking down at them with a smile .
suddenly [???] looked up . ' ah [???] there you are at last [???] d [???] [???] ! ' he
cried .
` strider ! ' said [???] . ` you seem to have a lot of names . '
` well [???] strider is one that i haven ' t heard before [???] anyway [???] ' said [???] .
` what do you call him that for ? '
` they call me that in bree [???] ' said strider laughing [???] ' and that is how i
was introduced to him . '
` and why do you call him d [???] [???] ? ' asked [???] .
` the d [???] [???] [???] ' said [???] . ` he is often called that here . but i thought
you knew enough elvish at least to know d [???] n - [???] : man of the west [???]
n [???] [???] . but this is not the time for lessons ! ' he turned to strider .
` where have you been [???] my friend ? why weren ' t you at the feast ? the lady
[???] was there . '
strider looked down at [???] gravely . ` i know [???] ' he said . ' but often i
must put mirth aside . [???] and [???] have returned out of the wild
[???] - for [???] and they had tidings that i wished to hear at once . '
` well [???] my dear fellow [???] ' said [???] [???] ` now you ' ve heard the news [???] can ' t
you spare me a moment ? i want your help in something urgent . [???] says
this song of mine is to be finished before the end of the evening [???] and i am
stuck . let ' s go off into a corner and polish it up ! '
strider smiled . ` come then ! ' he said . ` let me hear it ! '
[???] was left to himself for a while . for sam had fallen asleep . he
was alone and felt rather forlorn ` although all about him the folk of
[???] were gathered . but those near him were silent [???] intent upon the
music of the voices and the instruments . and they gave no heed to anything
else . [???] began to listen .
at first the beauty of the [???] and of the [???] words in
elven - tongues [???] even though he understood them little ` held him in a spell [???]
as soon as he began to attend to them . almost it seemed that the words took
shape [???] and visions of far la nds and bright things that he had never yet

imagined opened out before him ; and the [???] hall became like a golden
mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the world . then the
enchantment became more and more dreamlike [???] until he felt that an endless
river of swelling gold and silver was flowing over him [???] too [???]
for its pattern to be comprehended ; it became part of the [???] air
about him [???] and it drenched and drowned him . swiftly he sank under its
shining weight into a deep realm of sleep .
there he wandered long in a dream of music that turned into running
water [???] and then suddenly into a voice . it seemed to be the voice of [???]
chanting verses . faint at first and then clearer ran the words .
[???] was a mariner
that tarried in [???] ;
he built a boat of timber felled
in [???] to journey in ;
her sails he wove of silver fair [???]
of silver were her lanterns made [???]
her prow was fashioned like a swan [???]
and light upon her banners laid .

in [???] of ancient kings [???]
in chain [???] d rings he armoured him ;
his shining shield was scored with runes
to ward all wounds and harm from him ;
his bow was made of dragon - horn [???]
his arrows shorn of [???] [???]
of silver was his [???] [???]
his [???] of [???] ;
his sword of steel was valiant [???]
of adamant his helmet tall [???]
an eagle - plume upon his crest [???]
upon his breast an [???] .

beneath the moon and under star
he wandered far from northern [???] [???]
[???] on enchanted ways
beyond the days of mortal lands .
from [???] of the narrow ice

where shadow lies on frozen hills [???]
from nether heats and burning waste
he turned in haste [???] and roving still
on starless waters far [???]
at last he came to night of naught [???]
and passed [???] and never sight he saw
of shining shore nor light he sought .

the winds of wrath came driving him [???]
and blindly in the foam he fled
from west to east and errandless [???]
[???] he homeward sped .

there flying [???] came to him [???]
and flame was in the darkness lit ;
more bright than light of diamond
the fire upon her [???] .
the [???] she bound on him
and crowned him with the living light
and [???] then with burning brow
he turned his prow ; and in the night
from [???] beyond the sea
there strong and free a storm arose [???]
a wind of power in [???] ;
by paths that seldom mortal goes
his boat it bore with biting breath
as might of death across the grey
and long - forsaken seas distressed :
from east to west he passed away .

through evernight he back was borne
on black and roaring wa ves that ran
o ' er leagues unlit and foundered shores
that drowned before the days began [???]
until he heard on [???] of pearl
when ends the world the music long [???]
where ever foaming billows roll

the yellow gold and jewels wan .
he saw the mountain silent rise
where [???] lies upon the knees
of valinor [???] and [???]
beheld afar beyond the seas .
a wanderer escaped from night
to haven white he came at last [???]
to [???] the green and fair
where keen the air [???] where pale as glass
beneath the hill of [???]
a - glimmer in a valley sheer
the [???] towers of tirion
are mirrored on the [???] .

he tarried there from [???] [???]
and [???] they taught to him [???]
and sages old him marvels told [???]
and harps of gold they brought to him .
they clothed him then in elven - white [???]
and seven lights before him sent [???]
as through the [???]
to hidden land forlorn he went .
he came unto the timeless halls
where shining fall the countless years [???]
and endless reigns the elder king
in [???] on mountain sheer ;
and words unheard were spoken then
of folk of men and elven - kin [???]
beyond the world were visions showed
forbid to those that dwell therein .

a ship then new they built for him
of [???] and of elven - glass
with shining prow ; no shaven oar
nor sail she bore on silver mast :
the [???] as lantern light
and banner bright with living flame

to gleam thereon by [???]
herself was set [???] who thither came
and wings immortal made for him [???]
and laid on him undying doom [???]
to sail the shoreless skies and come
behind the sun and light of moon .

from [???] ' s lofty hills
where softly silver fountains fall
his wings him bore [???] a wandering light [???]
beyond the mighty mountain wall .
from world ' s end then he turned away
and yearned again to find afar
his home through shadows journeying [???]
and burning as an island star
on high above the mists he came [???]
a distant flame before the sun [???]
a wonder ere the waking dawn
where grey the norland waters run .

and over middle - earth he passed
and heard at last the weeping sore
of women and of elven - maids
in elder days [???] in years of yore .
gut on him mighty doom was laid [???]
till moon should fade [???] an orb [???] d star
to pass [???] and tarry never more
on hither shores where mortals are ;
for ever still a herald on
an errand that should never rest
to bear his shining lamp afar [???]
the [???] of westernesse .
the chanting ceased . [???] opened his eyes and saw that [???] was
seated on his stool in a circle of listeners [???] who were smiling and
applauding .
` now we had better have it again [???] ' said an elf .
[???] got up and bowed . ` i am flattered [???] [???] [???] ' he said . ' but it

would be too tiring to repeat it all . '
' not too tiring for you [???] ' the elves answered laughing . ' you k now you
are never tired of reciting your own verses . but really we cannot answer
your question at one hearing ! '
` what ! ' cried [???] . ' you can ' t tell which parts were mine [???] and which
were the d [???] [???] ' s ? '
' it is not easy for us to tell the difference between two mortals ' said
the elf .
' nonsense [???] [???] [???] ' snorted [???] . ' if you can ' t distinguish between a
man and a hobbit [???] your judgement is poorer than i imagined . they ' re as
different as peas and apples . '
' maybe . to sheep other sheep no doubt appear different [???] ' laughed
[???] . ` or to shepherds . but mortals have not been our study . we have other
business . '
' i won ' t argue with you [???] ' said [???] . ' i am sleepy after so much music
and singing . i ' ll leave you to guess [???] if you want to . '
he got up and came towards [???] . ' well [???] that ' s over [???] ' he said in a low
voice . ` it went off better than i expected . i don ' t often get asked for a
second hearing . what did you think of it ? '
` i am not going to try and guess [???] ' said [???] smiling .
` you needn ' t [???] ' said [???] . ` as a matter of fact it was all mine . except
that [???] insisted on my putting in a green stone . he seemed to think it
important . i don ' t know why . otherwise he obviously thought the whole thing
rather above my head [???] and he said that if i had the cheek to make verses
about [???] in the house of [???] [???] it was my affair . i suppose he was
right . '
' i don ' t know [???] ' said [???] . ` it seemed to me to fit somehow [???] though i
can ' t explain . i was half asleep when you began [???] and it seemed to follow on
from something that i was dreaming about . i didn ' t understand that it was
really you speaking until near the end . '
` it is difficult to keep awake here [???] until you get used to it ; ' said
[???] . ' not that [???] would ever acquire quite the elvish appetite for
music and poetry and tales . they seem to like them as much as food [???] or more .
they will be going on for a long time yet . what do you say to slipping off
for some more quiet talk ? '
` can we ? ' said [???] .
` of course . this is [???] not business . come and go as you like [???]

as long as you don ' t make a noise . '
they got up and withdrew quietly into the shadows [???] and made for the
doors . sam they left behind [???] fast asleep still with a smile on his face . in
spite of his delight in [???] ' s company [???] felt a tug of regret as they
passed out of the hall of fire . even as they stepped over the [???] a
single clear voice rose in song .
a [???] [???] [???]
[???] penna [???]
o menel aglar [???] !
na - chaered palan - [???]
o [???] [???] [???]
[???] [???] le [???]
nef aear [???] sn nef [???] !
[???] halted for a moment [???] looking back . [???] was in his chair and
the fire was on his face like summer - light upon the trees . near him sat the
lady [???] . to his surprise [???] saw that [???] stood beside her ; his
dark cloak was thrown back [???] and he seemed to be clad in elven - mail [???] and a
star shone on his breast . they spoke together [???] and then suddenly it seemed
to [???] that [???] turned towards him [???] and the light of her eyes fell on
him from afar and pierced his heart .
he stood still enchanted [???] while the sweet syllables of the elvish song
fell like clear jewels of blended word and melody . ` it is a song to
[???] [???] ' said [???] . ` they will sing that [???] and other songs of the blessed
realm [???] many times tonight . come on ! '
he led [???] back to his own little room . it opened on to the gar dens
and looked south across the ravine of the [???] . there they sat for some
while [???] looking through the window at the bright stars above the
steep - climbing woods [???] and talking softly . they spoke no more of the small
news of the shire far away [???] nor of the dark shadows and perils that
[???] them [???] but of the fair things they had seen in the world
together [???] of the elves [???] of the stars [???] of trees [???] and the gentle fall of the
bright year in the woods .
at last there came a knock on the door . ` begging your pardon [???] ' said
sam [???] putting in his head [???] ` but i was just wondering if you would be wanting
anything . '
` and begging yours [???] sam [???] [???] ' replied [???] . ` i guess you mean that
it is time your master went to bed . '

` well [???] sir [???] there is a council early tomorrow [???] i hear and he only got
up today for the first time . '
` quite right [???] sam [???] ' laughed [???] . ` you can trot off and tell [???]
that he has gone to bed . good night [???] [???] ! bless me [???] but it has been good
to see you again ! there are no folk like [???] after all for a real good
talk . i am getting very old [???] and i began to wonder if i should ever live to
see your chapters of our story . good night ! i ' ll take a walk [???] i think [???] and
look at the stars of [???] in the garden . sleep well ! '




chapter 2 . the council of [???]



next day [???] woke early [???] feeling refreshed and well . he walked along
the terraces above the loud - flowing [???] and watched the pale [???] cool sun
rise above the far mountains [???] and shine down . [???] through the thin
silver mist ; the dew upon the yellow leaves was [???] [???] and the woven
nets of [???] [???] on every bush . sam walked beside him [???] saying
nothing . but [???] the air [???] and looking every now and again with wonder
in his eyes at the great heights in the east . the snow was white upon their
peaks .
on a seat cut in the stone beside a turn in the path they came upon
[???] and [???] deep in talk . ` hullo ! good morning ! ' said [???] . ` feel
ready for the great council ? '
` i feel ready for anything [???] ' answered [???] . ` but most of all i should
like to go walking today and explore the valley . i should like to get into
those pine - woods up there . ' he pointed away far up the side of [???] to
the north .
' you may have a chance later [???] ' said [???] . ` but we cannot make any
plans yet . there is much to hear and decide today . '
suddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out . ` that is
the warning bell for the council of [???] [???] ' cr ied [???] . ` come along now !
both you and [???] are wanted . '
[???] and [???] followed the [???] quickly along the winding path back
to the house ; behind them [???] [???] and for the moment forgotten [???] trotted
sam .
[???] led them to the porch where [???] had found his friends the
evening before . the light of the clear autumn morning was now glowing in the
valley . the noise of [???] waters came up from the foaming river - bed .
birds were singing [???] and a wholesome peace lay on the land . to [???] his
dangerous flight [???] and the rumours of the darkness growing in the world
outside [???] already seemed only the memories of a troubled dream ; but the faces
that were turned to meet them as they entered were grave .
[???] was there [???] and several others were seated in silence about him .
[???] saw [???] and [???] ; and in a corner alone strider was sitting [???]
clad in his old travel - worn clothes again . [???] drew [???] to a seat by

his side [???] and presented him to the company [???] saying :
' here [???] my friends is the hobbit [???] [???] son of drogo . few have ever come
hither through greater peril or on an errand more urgent . '
he then pointed out and named those whom [???] had not met before .
there was a younger dwarf at [???] ' s side : his son [???] . beside [???]
there were several other counsellors of [???] ' s household [???] of whom [???]
was the chief ; and with him was [???] [???] an elf from the grey havens who had
come on an errand from [???] the [???] . there was also a strange elf
clad in green and brown [???] legolas [???] a messenger from his father [???] [???] [???]
the king of the elves of northern [???] . and seated a little apart was a
tall man with a fair and noble face [???] dark - haired and grey - eyed [???] proud and
stern of glance .
he was cloaked and booted as if for a journey on [???] ; and indeed
though his garments were rich [???] and his cloak was lined with fur [???] they were
stained with long travel . he had a collar of silver in which a single white
stone was set ; his locks were shorn about his shoulders . on a baldric he
wore a great horn tipped with silver that now was laid upon his knees . he
gazed at [???] and [???] with sudden wonder .
` here [???] ' said [???] [???] turning to [???] [???] ` is [???] [???] a man from the
south . he arrived in the grey morning [???] and seeks for counsel . i have bidden
him to be present [???] for here his questions will be answered . '
not all that was spoken and debated in the council need now be told .
much was said of events in the world outside [???] especially in the south [???] and
in the wide lands east of the mountains . of these things [???] had already
heard many rumours ; but the tale of [???] was new to him [???] and when the dwarf
spoke he listened attentively . it appeared that amid the [???] of their
works of hand the hearts of the [???] of the lonely mountain were
troubled .
` it is now many years ago [???] ' said [???] [???] ` that a shadow of [???] fell
upon our people . whence it came we did not at first perceive . words began to
be whispered in secret - : it was said that we were hemmed in a narrow place [???]
and that greater wealth and [???] would be found in a wider world . some
spoke of moria : the mighty works of our fathers that are called in our own
tongue [???] - dym ; and they declared that now at last we had the power and
numbers to return . '
[???] sighed . ` moria ! moria ! wonder of the northern world ! too deep we
delved there [???] and woke the nameless fear . long have its vast mansions lain

empty since the children of durin fled . but now we spoke of it again with
longing [???] and yet with dread ; for no dwarf has dared to pass the doors of
[???] - dym for many lives of kings [???] save thrur only [???] and he perished . at
last [???] however [???] balin listened to the whispers [???] and resolved to go ; and
though [???] did not give leave willingly [???] he took with him ori and uin and
many of our folk [???] and they went away south .
[???] that was nigh on thirty years ago . for a while we had news and it
seemed good : messages reported that moria ha d been entered and a great work
begun there . then there was silence [???] and no word has ever come from moria
since .
[???] then about a year ago a messenger came to [???] [???] but not from
moria - from [???] : a horseman in the night [???] who called [???] to his gate . the
lord [???] the great [???] so he said [???] wished for our friendship . rings he would
give for it [???] such as he gave of old . and he asked urgently concerning
[???] [???] of what kind they were [???] and where they dwelt . [???] for [???] knows [???] [???]
said he [???] [???] that one of these was known to you on a time . [???]
' at this we were greatly troubled [???] and we gave no answer . and then his
fell voice was lowered [???] and he would have sweetened it if he could . [???] as a
small token only of your friendship [???] asks this [???] [???] he said : [???] that you
should find this thief [???] [???] such was his word [???] [???] and get from him [???] willing or
no [???] a little ring [???] the least of rings [???] that once he stole . it is but a
trifle that [???] fancies [???] and an earnest of your good will . find it [???] and
three rings that the dwarf sires possessed of old shall be returned to you [???]
and the realm of moria shall be yours for ever . find only news of the thief [???]
whether he still lives and where [???] and you shall have great reward and
lasting friendship from the lord . refuse [???] and things will not seem so well .
do you refuse ? [???]
' at that his breath came like the hiss of snakes [???] and all who stood by
[???] [???] but [???] said : [???] i say neither yea nor nay . i must consider this
message and what it means under its fair cloak . [???]
' [???] consider well [???] but not too long [???] [???] said he .
` [???] the time of my thought is my own to spend [???] [???] answered [???] .
' [???] for the present [???] [???] said he [???] and rode into the darkness .
' heavy have the hearts of our [???] been since that night . we
needed not the fell voice of the messenger to warn us that his words held
both menace and deceit ; for we knew already that the power that has
re - entered [???] has not changed [???] and ever it betrayed us of old . twice the

messenger has returned [???] and has gone [???] . the third and last time [???] so
he says [???] is soon to come [???] before the ending of the year .
' and so i have been sent at last by [???] to warn [???] that he is
sought by the enemy [???] and to learn [???] if may be [???] why he desires this ring [???] this
least of rings . also we crave the advice of [???] . for the shadow grows and
draws nearer . we discover that messengers have come also to king brand in
dale [???] and that he is afraid . we fear that he may yield . already war is
gathering on his eastern borders . if we make no answer [???] the enemy may move
men of his rule to assail king brand [???] and [???] also . '
` you have done well to come [???] ' said [???] . ` you will hear today all
that you need in order to understand the purposes of the enemy . there is
naught that you can do [???] other than to resist [???] with hope or without it . but
you do not stand alone . you will learn that your trouble is but part of the
trouble of all the western world . the ring ! what shall we do with the ring [???]
the least of rings [???] the trifle that [???] fancies ? that is the doom that we
must deem .
` that is the purpose for which you are called hither . called [???] i say .
though i have not called you to me [???] strangers from distant lands . you have
come and are here met [???] in this very nick of time [???] by chance as it may seem .
yet it is not so . believe rather that it is so ordered that we [???] who sit
here [???] and none others [???] must now find counsel for the peril of the world .
` now [???] therefore [???] things shall be openly spoken that have been hidden
from all but a few until this day . and first [???] so that all may understand
what is the peril [???] the tale of the ring shall be told from the beginning
even to this present . and i will begin that tale [???] though others shall end
it . '
then all listened while [???] in his clear voice spoke of [???] and
the rings of power [???] and their forging in the second age of the world long
ago . a part of his tale was known to some there [???] but the full tale to none [???]
and many eyes were turned t = [???] in fear and wonder as he told of the
elven - smiths of [???] and their friendship with moria [???] and their eagerness
for knowledge [???] by which [???] [???] them . for in that time he was not
yet evil to behold [???] and they received his aid and grew mighty in craft [???]
whereas he learned all their secrets [???] and betrayed them [???] and forged secretly
in the mountain of fire the one ring to be their master . but [???] was
aware of him [???] and hid the three which he had made ; and there was war [???] and
the land was laid waste [???] and the gate of moria was shut .

then through all the years that followed he traced the ring ; but since
that history is elsewhere recounted [???] even as [???] himself set it down in
his books of lore [???] it is not here recalled . for it is a long tale [???] full of
deeds great and terrible [???] and briefly though [???] spoke [???] the sun rode up
the sky [???] and the morning was passing ere he ceased .
of n [???] menor he spoke [???] its glory and its fall [???] and the return of the
kings of men to middle - earth out of the deeps of the sea [???] borne upon the
wings of storm . then [???] the tall and his mighty sons [???] [???] and
[???] [???] became great lords ; and the north - realm they made in [???] [???] and the
south - realm in [???] above the mouths of [???] . but [???] of [???]
assailed them [???] and they made the last alliance of elves and men [???] and the
hosts of gil - [???] and [???] were mustered in [???] .
thereupon [???] paused a while and sighed . ` i remember well the
[???] of their banners [???] ' he said . ` it recalled to me the glory of the
elder days and the hosts of [???] [???] so many great princes and captains
were assembled . and yet not so many [???] nor so fair [???] as when [???] was
broken [???] and the elves deemed that evil was ended for ever [???] and it was not
so . '
` you remember ? ' said [???] [???] speaking his thought aloud in his
astonishment . ` but i thought [???] ' he [???] as [???] turned towards him [???] ' i
thought that the fall of gil - [???] was a long age ago . '
' so it was indeed [???] ' answered [???] gravely . ` but my memory reaches
back even to the elder days . [???] was my sire [???] who was born in [???]
before its fall ; and my mother was [???] [???] daughter of dior [???] son of l [???] thien
of [???] . i have seen three ages in the west of the world [???] and many
defeats [???] and many fruitless victories .
` i was the herald of gil - [???] and marched with his host . i was at the
battle of [???] before the black gate of [???] [???] where we had the
mastery : for the spear of gil - [???] and the sword of [???] [???] [???] and
[???] [???] none could withstand . i beheld the last combat on the [???] of
[???] [???] where gil - [???] died [???] and [???] fell [???] and [???] broke beneath
him ; but [???] himself was overthrown [???] and [???] cut the ring from his
hand with the hilt - shard of his father ' s sword [???] and took it for his own . '
at this the stranger [???] [???] [???] broke in . ` so that is what became of the
ring ! ' he cried . ` if ever such a tale was told in the south [???] it has long
been forgotten . i have heard of the great ring of him that we do not name ;
but we believed that it perished from the world in the ruin of his first

realm . [???] took it ! that is tidings indeed . '
` alas ! yes [???] ' said [???] . ` [???] took it [???] as should not have been . it
should have been cast then into [???] ' s fire nigh at hand where it was
made . but few marked what [???] did . he alone stood by his father in that
last mortal contest ; and by gil - [???] only [???] stood [???] and i . but [???]
would not listen to our counsel .
' [???] this i will have as [???] for my father [???] and my brother [???] [???] he
said ; and therefore whether we would or no [???] he took it to treasure it . but
soon he was betrayed by it to his death ; and so it is named in the north
[???] ' s bane . yet death maybe was better than what else might have
befallen him .
' only to the north did these tidings come [???] and only to a few . small
wonder it is that you have not heard them [???] [???] . from the ruin of the
gladden fields [???] where [???] perished [???] three men only came ever back over
the mountains after long wandering . one of these was [???] [???] the esquire of
[???] [???] who bore the shards of the sword of [???] ; and he brought them to
[???] [???] the heir of [???] [???] who being but a child had remained here in
[???] . but [???] was broken and its light [???] [???] and it has not
yet been forged again .
` fruitless did i call the victory of the last alliance ? not wholly so [???]
yet it did not achieve its end . [???] was diminished [???] but not destroyed .
his ring was lost but not unmade . the dark tower was broken [???] but its
foundations were not removed ; for they were made with the power of the ring [???]
and while it remains they wi ll endure . many elves and many mighty men [???]
and
many of their friends . had perished in the war . [???] was slain [???] and
[???] was slain ; and gil - [???] and [???] were no more . never again shall
there be any such league of elves and men ; for men [???] and the
firstborn [???] [???] and the two kindreds are [???] . and ever since that
day the race of n [???] menor has decayed [???] and the span of their years has
lessened .
' in the north after the war and the slaughter of the gladden fields the
men of westernesse were diminished [???] and their city of ann [???] minas beside
lake
[???] fell into ruin ; and the heirs of [???] removed and dwelt at
[???] on the high north downs [???] and that now too is desolate . men call it
deadmen ' s dike [???] and they fear to tread there . for the folk of [???]

[???] [???] and their foes devoured them [???] and their lordship passed [???] leaving
only green mounds in the grassy hills .
' in the south the realm of [???] long endured ; and for a while its
[???] grew [???] recalling somewhat of the might of n [???] menor [???] ere it fell .
high towers that people built [???] and strong places . and havens of many ships ;
and the winged crown of the kings of men was held in awe by folk of many
tongues . their chief city wa s [???] [???] [???] of the stars . through the
midst of which the river flowed . and minas [???] they built [???] tower of the
rising moon [???] eastward upon a shoulder of the mountains of shadow ; and
westward at the feet of the white mountains minas anor they made [???] tower of
the setting sun . there in the courts of the king grew a white tree [???] from the
seed of that tree which [???] brought over the deep waters [???] and the seed
of that tree before came from [???] [???] and before that out of the uttermost
west in the day before days when the world was young .
` but in the wearing of the swift years of middle - earth the line of
[???] son of [???] failed [???] and the tree withered [???] and the blood of the
n [???] [???] became mingled with that of lesser men . then the watch upon
the
walls of [???] slept [???] and dark things crept back to [???] . and on a
time evil things came forth [???] and they took minas [???] and [???] in it [???] and
they made it into a place of dread ; and it is called minas [???] [???] the tower
of [???] . then minas anor was named anew minas [???] [???] the tower of
guard ;
and these two cities were ever at war [???] but [???] which lay between was
deserted and in its ruins shadows walked .
' so it has been for many lives of men . but the lords of minas [???]
still fight on [???] defying our enemies [???] keeping the passage of the river from
[???] to the sea . and now that part of the tale that i shall tell is
drawn to its close . for in the days of [???] the ruling ring passed out of
all knowledge [???] and the three were released from its dominion . but now in
this latter day they are in peril once more [???] for to our sorrow the one has
been found . others shall speak of its finding [???] for in that i played small
part . '
he ceased [???] but at once [???] stood up [???] tall and proud [???] before them .
give me leave [???] master [???] [???] said he [???] first to say more of [???] ; for
verily from the land of [???] i am come . and it would be well for all to
know what passes there . for few [???] i deem [???] know of our deeds [???] and therefore

guess little of their peril [???] if we should fail at last .
` believe not that in the land of [???] the blood of n [???] menor is spent [???]
nor all its pride and dignity forgotten . by our valour the wild folk of the
east are still restrained [???] and the terror of [???] kept at bay ; and thus
alone are peace and freedom maintained in the lands behind us [???] bulwark of
the west . but if the passages of the river should be won [???] what then ?
` yet that hour [???] maybe [???] is not now far away . the nameless enemy has
arisen again . smoke rises once more from [???] that we call mount
doom .
the power of the black land grows and we are hard beset . when the
enemy
returned our folk were driven from [???] [???] our fair domain east of the
river [???] though we kept a foothold there and strength of arms . but this very
year [???] in the days of june [???] sudden war came upon us out of [???] [???] and we
were swept away . we were [???] [???] for [???] has allied itself with the
[???] and the cruel [???] ; but it was not by numbers that we were
defeated . a power was there that we have not felt before .
` some said that it could be seen [???] like a great black horseman [???] a dark
shadow under the moon . wherever he came a madness filled our foes [???] but fear
fell on our boldest [???] so that horse and man gave way and fled . only a [???]
of our eastern force came back [???] destroying the last bridge that still stood
amid the ruins of [???] .
' i was in the company that held the bridge [???] until it was cast down
behind us . four only were saved by swimming : my brother and myself and
two
others . but still we fight on [???] holding all the west shores of [???] ; and
those who shelter behind us give us praise [???] if ever they hear our name : much
praise but little help . only from [???] now will any men ride to us when we
call .
` in this evil hour i have come on an errand over many dangerous leagues
to [???] : a hundred and ten days i have journeyed all alone . but i do not
seek allies in war . the might of [???] is in wisdom not in weapons [???] it is
said . i come to ask for counsel and the [???] of hard words . for on
the eve of the sudden assault a dream came to my brother in a troubled
sleep ; and afterwards a like dream came oft to him again [???] and once to me .
' in that dream i thought the eastern sky grew dark and there was a
growing thunder [???] but in the west a pale light lingered [???] and out of it i

heard a voice [???] remote but clear [???] crying :
seek for the sword that was broken :
in [???] it dwells ;
there shall be counsels taken
stronger than [???] - spells .
there shall be shown a token
that doom is near at hand [???]
for [???] ' s bane shall waken [???]
and the halfling forth shall stand .
of these words we could understand little [???] and we spoke to our father [???]
[???] [???] lord of minas [???] [???] wise in the lore of [???] . this only would
he say [???] that [???] was of old the name among the elves of a far northern
dale [???] where [???] the [???] dwelt [???] g [???] of lore - masters . therefore
my brother [???] seeing how desperate was our need [???] was eager to heed the dream
and seek for [???] ; but since the way was full of doubt and danger [???] i
took the journey upon myself . loth was my father to give me leave [???] and long
have i wandered by roads forgotten [???] seeking the house of [???] [???] of which
many had heard [???] but few knew where it lay . '
' and here in the house of [???] more shall be made clear to you ' said
[???] [???] standing up . he cast his sword upon the table that stood before
[???] [???] and the blade was in two pieces . ` here is the sword that was
broken ! ' he said .
` and who are you [???] and what have you to do with minas [???] ? ' asked
[???] [???] looking in wonder at the lean face of the ranger and his
weather - stained cloak .
` he is [???] son of [???] [???] ' said [???] ; ` and he is descended
through many fathers from [???] [???] ' s son of minas [???] . he is the
chief of the d [???] nedain in the north [???] and few are now left of that folk . '
` then it belongs to you [???] and not to me at all ! ' cried [???] in
amazement [???] springing to his feet [???] as if he expected the ring to be demanded
at once .
' it does not belong to either of us [???] ' said [???] ; ` but it has been
ordained that you should hold it for a while . '
' bring out the ring [???] [???] ! ' said [???] solemnly . ` the time has come .
hold it up [???] and then [???] will understand the remainder of his riddle . '
there was a hush [???] and all turned their eyes on [???] . he was shaken by
a sudden shame and fear ; and he felt a great [???] to reveal the ring [???]

and a loathing of its touch . he wished he was far away . the ring gleamed and
[???] as he held it up before them in his trembling hand .
' behold [???] ' s bane ! ' said [???] .
[???] ' s eyes glinted as he gazed at the golden thing . ` the halfling ! '
he muttered . ` is then the doom of minas [???] come at last ? but why then
should we seek a broken sword ? '
' the words were not the doom of minas tir ith [???] ' said [???] . ` but doom
and great deeds are indeed at hand . for the sword that was broken is the
sword of [???] that broke beneath him when he fell . it has been treasured
by his heirs when all other [???] were lost ; for it was spoken of old
among us that it should be made again when the ring [???] [???] ' s bane [???] was
found . now you have seen the sword that you have sought [???] what would you
ask ?
do you wish for the house of [???] to return to the land of [???] ? '
` i was not sent to beg any boon [???] but to seek only the meaning of a
riddle [???] ' answered [???] proudly . ` yet we are hard pressed [???] and the sword
of [???] would be a help beyond our hope - if such a thing could indeed
return out of the shadows of the past . ' he look ed again at [???] [???] and
doubt was in his eyes .
[???] felt [???] stir impatiently at his side . evidently he was annoyed
on his friend ' s behalf . standing suddenly up he burst out :
all that is gold does not glitter [???]
not all those who wander are lost ;
the old that is strong does not wither [???]
deep roots are not reached by the frost .

from the ashes a fire shall be woken [???]
a light from the shadows shall spring ;
renewed shall be blade that was broken :
the crownless again shall be king .
` not very good perhaps [???] but to the point - - if you need more beyond the
word of [???] . if that was worth a journey of a hundred and ten days to
hear [???] you had best listen to it . ' he sat down with a snort .
` i made that up myself [???] ' he whispered to [???] [???] ` for the d [???] [???] [???] a
long time ago when he first told me about himself . i almost wish that my
adventures were not over [???] and that i could go with him when his day comes . '
[???] smiled at him ; then he turned to [???] again . ` for my part i

forgive your doubt [???] ' he said . ' little do i resemble the figures of [???]
and [???] as they stand carven in their majesty in the halls of [???] .
i am but the heir of [???] [???] not [???] himself . i have had a hard life
and a long ; and the leagues that lie between here and [???] are a small
part in the count of my journeys . i have crossed many mountains and many
rivers [???] and trodden many plains [???] even into the far countries of rhyn and
harad where the stars are strange .
' but my home [???] such as i have [???] is in the north . for here the heirs of
[???] have ever dwelt in long line [???] from father unto son for many
generations . our days have darkened [???] and we have [???] ; but ever the
sword has passed to a new keeper . and this i will say to you [???] [???] [???] ere i
end . lonely men are we [???] rangers of the wild [???] hunters - - but hunters ever of
the servants of the enemy ; for they are found in many places [???] not in [???]
only .
` if [???] [???] [???] [???] has been a [???] tower [???] we have played another
part . many evil things there are that your strong walls and bright swords do
not stay . you know little of the lands beyond your bounds . peace and
freedom [???] do you say ? the north would have known them little but for us . fear
would have destroyed them . but when dark things come from the houseless
hills [???] or creep from sunless woods [???] they fly from us . what roads would any
dare to tread [???] what safety would there be in quiet lands [???] or in the homes of
simple men at night [???] if the d [???] nedain were asleep [???] or were all gone into the
grave ?
` and yet less thanks have we than you . travellers [???] at us [???] and
countrymen give us scornful names . [???] strider [???] i am to one fat man who lives
within a day ' s march of foes that would freeze his heart or lay his little
town in ruin [???] if he were not guarded [???] . yet we would not have it
otherwise . if simple folk are free from care and fear [???] simple they will be [???]
and we must be secret to keep them so . that has been the task of my kindred [???]
while the years have lengthened and the grass has grown .
` but now the world is changing once again . a new hour comes . [???] ' s
bane is found . battle is at hand . the sword shall be [???] . i will come
to minas [???] . '
` [???] ' s bane is found [???] you say [???] ' said [???] . ` i have seen a bright
ring in the halfling ' s hand ; but [???] perished ere this age of the world
began [???] they say . how do the wise know that this ring is his ? and how has it
passed down the years [???] until it is brought hither by so strange a

messenger ? '
` that shall be told [???] ' said [???] .
` but not yet [???] i beg [???] master ! ' said [???] . ` already the sun is climbing
to noon [???] and i feel the need of something to strengthen me . '
` i had not named you [???] ' said [???] smiling . ` but i do so now . come !
tell us your tale . and if you have not yet cast your story into verse [???] you
may tell it in plain words . the briefer [???] the sooner shall you be refreshed . '
` very well [???] ' said [???] . ` i will do as you bid . but i will now tell the
true story [???] and if some here have heard me tell it otherwise ' - - he looked
sidelong at [???] - - ` i ask them to forget it and forgive me . i only wished
to claim the treasure as my very own in those days [???] and to be rid of the
name of thief that was put on me . but perhaps i understand things a little
better now . anyway [???] this is what happened . '
to some there [???] ' s tale was wholly new [???] and they listened with
amazement while the old hobbit [???] actually not at all displeased [???] recounted
his adventure with [???] [???] at full length . he did not omit a single riddle .
he would have given also an account of his party and [???] from the
shire [???] if he had been allowed ; but [???] raised his hand .
' well told [???] my friend [???] ' he said [???] ` but that is enough at this time . for
the moment it suffices to know that the ring passed to [???] [???] your heir . let
him now speak ! '
then [???] less willingly than [???] [???] [???] told of all his dealings with
the ring from the day that it passed into his keeping . every step of his
journey from [???] to the ford of [???] was questioned and considered [???]
and everything that he could recall concerning the black riders was
examined . at last he sat down again .
` not bad [???] ' [???] said to him . ` you would have made a good story of it [???]
if they hadn ' t kept on interrupting . i tried to make a few notes [???] but we
shall have to go over it all again together some time [???] if i am to write it
up . there are whole chapters of stuff before you ever got here ! '
` yes [???] it made quite a long tale [???] ' answered [???] . ' but the story still
does not seem complete to me . i still want to know a good deal [???] especially
about [???] . '
[???] of the havens [???] who sat near by [???] overheard him . ` you speak for me
also [???] ' he cried [???] and turning to [???] he said : ` the wise may have good
reason to believe that the halfling ' s trove is indeed the great ring of long
debate [???] unlikely though that may seem to those who know less . but may we not

hear the proofs ? and i would ask this also . what of [???] ? he is learned
in the lore of the rings [???] yet he is not among us . what is his counsel - if he
knows the things that we have heard ? '
` the questions that you ask [???] [???] [???] are bound together [???] ' said [???] .
` i had not overlooked them [???] and they shall be answered . but these things it
is the part of [???] to make clear ; and i call upon him last [???] for it is
the place of honour [???] and in all this matter he has been the chief . '
` some [???] [???] [???] ' said [???] [???] ` would think the tidings of [???] [???] and
the pursuit of [???] [???] proof enough that the halfling ' s trove is a thing of
great worth to the enemy . yet it is a ring . what then ? the nine the [???]
keep . the seven are taken or destroyed . ' at this [???] stirred [???] but did not
speak . ` the three we know of . what then is this one that he desires so much ?
' there is indeed a wide waste of time between the river and the
mountain [???] between the loss and the finding . but the gap in the knowledge of
the wise has been filled at last . yet too slowly . for the enemy has been
close behind [???] closer even than i feared . and well is it that not until this
year [???] this very summer [???] as it seems [???] did he learn the full truth .
' some here will remember that many years ago i myself dared to pass the
doors of the [???] in dol [???] [???] and secretly explored his ways [???] and
found thus that our fears were true : he was none other than [???] [???] our
enemy of old [???] at length taking shape and power again . some [???] too [???] will
remember also that [???] [???] us from open deeds against him [???] and
for
long we watched him only . yet at last [???] as his shadow grew [???] [???] yielded [???]
and the council put forth its strength and drove the evil out of [???]
and that was in the very year of the finding of this ring : a strange chance [???]
if chance it was .
` but we were too late [???] as [???] foresaw . [???] also had watched us [???]
and had long prepared against our stroke [???] governing [???] from afar through
minas morgu l [???] where his nine servants dwelt [???] until all was ready . then he
gave way before us [???] but only feigned to flee [???] and soon after came to the
dark tower and openly declared himself . then for the last time the council
met ; for now we learned that he was seeking ever more eagerly for the one .
we feared then that he had some news of it that we knew nothing of . but
[???] said nay [???] and repeated what he had said to us before : that the one
would never again be found in middle - earth .
` [???] at the worst [???] [???] said he [???] [???] our enemy knows that we have it not and

that it still is lost . but what was lost may yet be found [???] he thinks . fear
not ! his hope will cheat him . have i not earnestly studied this matter ? into
[???] the great it fell ; and long ago [???] while [???] slept [???] it was rolled
down the river to the sea . there let it lie until the end . [???] '
[???] fell silent [???] gazing eastward from the porch to the far peaks of
the misty mountains [???] at whose great roots the peril of the world had so long
lain hidden . he sighed .
` there i was at fault [???] ' he said . ` i was lulled by the words of [???]
the wise ; but i should have sought for the truth sooner [???] and our peril would
now be less . '
` we were all at fault [???] ' said [???] [???] ` and but for your [???] the
darkness [???] maybe [???] would already be upon us . but say on ! '
` from the first my heart [???] me [???] against all reason that i knew [???] '
said [???] [???] ` and i desired to know how this thing came to [???] [???] and how
long he had possessed it . so i set a wa tch for him [???] guessing that he would
ere long come forth from his darkness to seek for his treasure . he came [???] but
he escaped and was not found . and then alas ! i let the matter rest [???] watching
and waiting only [???] as we have too often done .
` time passed with many cares [???] until my doubts were awakened again to
sudden fear . whence came the hobbit ' s ring ? what [???] if my fear was true [???]
should be done with it ? those things i must decide . but i spoke yet of my
dread to none [???] knowing the peril of an untimely whisper [???] if it went [???] .
in all the long wars with the dark tower treason has ever been our greatest
foe .
' that was seventeen years ago . soon i became aware that spies of many
sorts [???] even beasts and birds [???] were gathered round the shire [???] and my fear
grew . i called for the help of the d [???] nedain [???] and their watch was doubled ;
and i opened my heart to [???] [???] the heir of [???] . '
` and i [???] ' said [???] [???] ` counselled that we should hunt for [???] . too
late though it may seem . and since it seemed fit that [???] ' s heir should
labour to repair [???] ' s fault [???] i went with [???] on the long and
hopeless search . '
then [???] told how they had explored the whole length of wilderland [???]
down even to the mountains of shadow and the fences of [???] . ` there we
had
rumour of him [???] and we guess that he dwelt there long in the dark hills ; but
we never found him [???] and at last i despaired . and then in my despair i

thought again of a test that might make the finding of [???] [???] . the
ring itself might tell if it were the one . the memory of words at the
council came back to me : words of [???] [???] half - heeded at the time . i heard
them now clearly in my heart .
` [???] the nine [???] the seven [???] and the three [???] [???] he said [???] [???] had each their proper
gem . not so the one . it was round and [???] [???] as it were one of the
lesser rings ; but its maker set marks upon it that the skilled [???] maybe [???] could
still see and read . [???]
` what those marks were he had not said . who now would know ? the
maker .
and [???] ? but great though his lore may be [???] it must have a source . what
hand save [???] ' s ever held this thing [???] ere it was lost ? the hand of
[???] alone .
` with that thought [???] i forsook the chase [???] and passed swiftly to [???] .
in former days the members of my order had been well received there [???] but
[???] most of all . often he had been for long the guest of the lords of
the city . less welcome did the lord [???] show me then than of old [???] and
[???] he permitted me to search among his hoarded scrolls and books .
' [???] if indeed you look only [???] as you say [???] for records of ancient days [???]
and the beginnings of the city [???] read on ! [???] he said . [???] for to me what was is
less dark than what is to come [???] and that is my care . but unless you have
more skill even than [???] [???] who has studied here long [???] you will find
naught that is not well known to me [???] who am master of the lore of this
city . [???]
` so said [???] . and yet there lie in his hoards many records that
few now can read [???] even of the lore - masters [???] for their [???] and tongues
have become dark to later men . and [???] [???] there lies in minas [???]
still [???] unread [???] i guess [???] by any save [???] and myself since the kings
failed [???] a scroll that [???] made himself . for [???] did not march away
straight from the war in [???] [???] as some have told the tale . '
' some in the north [???] maybe [???] ' [???] broke in . ' all know in [???] that
he went first to minas anor and dwelt a while with his nephew [???] [???]
instructing him [???] before he committed to him the rule of the south kingdom .
in that time he planted there the last sapling of the white tree in memory
of his brother . '
` but in that time also he made this scroll [???] ' said [???] ; ` and that is
not remembered in [???] [???] it would seem . for this scroll concerns the ring [???]

and thus wrote [???] therein :
the great ring shall go now to be an [???] of the north kingdom ; but
records of it shall be left in [???] [???] where also dwell the heirs of
[???] [???] lest a time come when the memory of these great matters shall grow
dim .
` and after these words [???] described the ring [???] such as he found it .
it was hot when i first took it [???] hot as a glede [???] and my hand was
[???] [???] so that i doubt if ever again i shall be free of the pain of it .
yet even as i write it is cooled [???] and it seemeth to shrink [???] though it loseth
neither its beauty nor its shape . already the writing upon it [???] which at
first was as clear as red flame [???] [???] and is now only barely to be read .
it is fashioned in an elven - script of [???] [???] for they have no letters in
[???] for such subtle work ; but the language is unknown to me . i deem it to
be a tongue of the black land [???] since it is foul and uncouth . what evil it
saith i do not know ; but i trace here a copy of it [???] lest it fade beyond
recall . the ring misseth [???] maybe [???] the heat of [???] ' s hand [???] which was black
and yet burned like fire [???] and so gil - [???] was destroyed ; and maybe were the
gold made hot again [???] the writing would be refreshed . gut for my part i will
risk no hurt to this thing : of all the works of [???] the only fair . it is
precious to me [???] though i buy it with great pain .
' when i read these words [???] my quest was ended . for the traced writing
was indeed as [???] guessed [???] in the tongue of [???] and the servants of
the tower . and what was said therein was already known . for in the day that
[???] first put on the one [???] [???] [???] maker of the three [???] was aware of
him [???] and from afar he heard him speak these words [???] and so his evil purposes
were revealed .
` at once i took my leave of [???] [???] but even as i went northwards [???]
messages came to me out of [???] that [???] had passed that way [???] and that
he had found the creature called [???] . therefore i went first to meet him
and hear his tale . into what deadly perils he had gone alone i dared not
guess . '
` there is little need to tell of them [???] ' said [???] . ` if a man must
needs walk in sight of the black gate [???] or tread the deadly flowers of [???]
vale [???] then perils he will have . i [???] too [???] despaired at last [???] and i began my
homeward journey . and then [???] by fortune [???] i came suddenly on what i sought :
the marks of soft feet beside a muddy pool . but now the trail was fresh and
swift [???] and it led not to [???] but away . along the skirts of the dead

marshes i followed it [???] and then i had him . lurking by a [???] mere [???]
peering in the water as the dark eve fell [???] i caught him [???] [???] . he was
covered with green slime . he will never love me [???] i fear ; for he bit me [???] and
i was not gentle . nothing more did i ever get from his mouth than the marks
of his teeth . i deemed it the worst part of all my journey [???] the road back [???]
watching him day and night [???] making him walk before me with a halter on his
neck [???] gagged [???] until he was tamed by lack of drink and food [???] driving him ever
towards [???] . i brought him there at last and gave him to the elves [???] for
we had agreed that this should be done ; and i was glad to be rid of his
company [???] for he stank . for my part i hope never to look upon him again ; but
[???] came and endured long speech with him . '
` yes [???] long and weary [???] ' said [???] [???] ` but not without profit . for one
thing [???] the tale he told of his loss agreed with that which [???] has now
told openly for the first time ; but that mattered little [???] since i had
already guessed it . but i learned then first that [???] ' s ring came out of
the great river nigh to the gladden fields . and i learned also that he had
possessed it long . many lives of his small kind . the power of the ring had
lengthened his years far beyond their span ; but that power only the great
rings wield .
` and if that is not proof enough [???] [???] [???] there is the other test that
i spoke of . upon this very ring which you have here seen held aloft [???] round
and [???] [???] the letters that [???] reported may still be read [???] if one
has the strength of will to set the golden thing in the fire a while . that i
have done [???] and this i have read :
ash [???] [???] [???] ush [???] [???] [???] ash [???] [???] agh
[???] - [???] [???] . '
the change in the [???] ' s voice was [???] . suddenly it became
[???] [???] powerful [???] harsh as stone . a shadow seemed to pass over the high
sun [???] and the porch for a moment grew dark . all trembled [???] and the elves
stopped their ears .
` never before has any voice dared to utter the words of that tongue in
[???] [???] [???] the grey [???] ' said [???] [???] as the shadow passed and the
company breathed once more .
` and let us hope that none will ever speak it here again [???] ' answered
[???] . ` nonetheless i do not ask your pardon [???] master [???] . for if that
tongue is not soon to be heard in every corner of the west [???] then let all put
doubt aside that this thing is indeed what the wise have declared : the

treasure of the enemy [???] fraught with all his malice ; and in it lies a great
part of his strength of old . out of the black years come the words that the
smiths of [???] heard [???] and knew that they had been betrayed :
one ring to rule them all [???] one ring to find them [???] one ring to bring
them all and in the darkness bind them .
` know also [???] my friends [???] that i learned more yet from [???] . he was
loth to speak and his tale was unclear [???] but it is beyond all doubt that he
went to [???] [???] and there all that he knew was forced from him . thus the
enemy knows now that the one is found [???] that it was long in the shire ; and
since his servants have pursued it almost to our door [???] he soon will know [???]
already he may know [???] even as i speak [???] that we have it here . '
all sat silent for a while [???] until at length [???] spoke . ` he is a
small thing [???] you say [???] this [???] ? small [???] but great in mischief . what became
of him ? to what doom did you put him ? '
' he is in prison [???] but no worse [???] ' said [???] . ` he had suffered much .
there is no doubt that he was tormented [???] and the fear of [???] lies black
on his heart . still i for one am glad that he is safely kept by the watchful
elves of [???] . his malice is great and gives him a strength hardly to be
believed in one so lean and withered . he could work much mischief still [???] if
he were free . and i do not doubt that he was allowed to leave [???] on some
evil errand . '
` alas ! alas ! ' cried legolas [???] and in his fair elvish face there was
great distress . ` the tidings that i was sent to bring must now be told . they
are not good [???] but only here have i learned how evil they may seem to this
company . [???] [???] who is now called [???] [???] has escaped . '
' escaped ? ' cried [???] . ' that is ill news indeed . we shall all rue it
bitterly [???] i fear . how came the folk of [???] to fail in their trust ? '
` not through lack of watchfulness [???] ' said legolas ; ` but perhaps through
over - kindliness . and we fear that the prisoner had aid from others [???] and that
more is known of our doings than we could wish . we guarded this creature day
and night [???] at [???] ' s bidding [???] much though we wearied of the task . but
[???] bade us hope still for his cure [???] and we had not the heart to keep
him ever in dungeons under the earth [???] where he would fall back into his old
black thoughts . '
' you were less tender to me [???] ' said [???] with a flash of his eyes as
old memories were stirred of his imprisonment in the deep places of the
elven - king ' s halls .

' now come ! ' said [???] . ` pray do not interrupt [???] my good [???] . that
was a [???] [???] [???] long set right . if all the grievances
that stand between elves and [???] are to be brought up here [???] we may as
well abandon this council . '
[???] rose and bowed [???] and legolas continued . ' in the days of fair
weather we led [???] through the woods ; and there was a high tree standing
alone far from the others which he liked to climb . often we let him mount up
to the highest branches [???] until he felt the free wind ; but we set a guard at
the tree ' s foot . one day he refused to come down [???] and the guards had no mind
to climb after him : he had learned the trick of [???] to boughs with his
feet as well as with his hands ; so they sat by the tree far into the night .
' it was that very night of summer [???] yet moonless and starless [???] that [???]
came on us at [???] . we drove them off after some time ; they were many
and fierce [???] but they came from over the mountains [???] and were unused to the
woods . when the battle was over [???] we found that [???] was gone [???] and his
guards were slain or taken . it then seemed plain to us that the attack had
been made for his rescue [???] and that he knew of it beforehand . how that was
contrived we cannot guess ; but [???] is cunning [???] and the spies of the enemy
are many . the dark things that were driven out in the year of the dragon ' s
fall have returned in greater numbers [???] and [???] is again an evil place [???]
save where our realm is maintained .
` we have failed to [???] [???] . we came on his trail among those
of many [???] [???] and it [???] deep into the forest [???] going south . but ere long
it escaped our skill [???] and we dared not continue the hunt ; for we were
drawing nigh to dol [???] [???] and that is still a very evil place ; we do not
go that way . '
` well [???] well [???] he is gone [???] ' said [???] . ' we have no time to seek for
him again . he must do what he will . but he may play a part yet that neither
he nor [???] have foreseen .
' and now i will answer [???] ' s other questions . what of [???] ? what
are his counsels to us in this need ? this tale i must tell in full [???] for only
[???] has heard it yet [???] and that in brief [???] but it will bear on all that we
must resolve . it is the last chapter in the tale of the ring [???] so far as it
has yet gone .
' at the end of june i was in the shire [???] but a cloud of anxiety was on
my mind [???] and i rode to the southern borders of the little land ; for i had a
[???] of some danger [???] still hidden from me but drawing near . there

messages reached me telling me of war and defeat in [???] [???] and when i heard
of the black shadow a chill smote my heart . but i found nothing save a few
[???] from the south ; yet it seemed to me that on them sat a fear of
which they would not speak . i turned then east and north and journeyed along
the greenway ; and not far from bree i came upon a traveller sitting on a
bank beside the road with his grazing horse beside him . it was [???] the
brown [???] who at one time dwelt at [???] [???] near the borders of [???] .
he
is one of my order [???] but i had not seen him for many a year .
` [???] [???] ! [???] he cried . [???] i was seeking you . but i am a stranger in
these parts . all i knew was that you might be found in a wild region with
the uncouth name of shire . [???]
' [???] your information was correct [???] [???] i said . [???] but do not put it that way [???]
if you meet any of the inhabitants . you are near the borders of the shire
now . and what do you want with me ? it must be pressing . you were never a
traveller [???] unless driven by great need . [???]
' [???] i have an urgent errand [???] [???] he said . [???] my news is evil . [???] then he looked
about him [???] as if the hedges might have ears . [???] [???] [???] [???] he whispered . [???] the
nine are abroad again . they have crossed the river secretly and are moving
westward . they have taken the guise of riders in black . [???]
' i knew then what i had dreaded without knowing it .
` [???] the enemy must have some great need or purpose [???] [???] said [???] ; [???] but
what it is that makes him look to these distant and desolate parts [???] i cannot
guess . [???]
` [???] what do you mean ? [???] said i .
` [???] i have been told that wherever they go the riders ask for news of a
land called shire . [???]
' [???] the shire [???] [???] i said ; but my heart sank . for even the wise might fear
to withstand the nine [???] when they are gathered together under their fell
chieftain . a great king and [???] he was of old [???] and now he [???] a
deadly fear . [???] who told you [???] and who sent you ? [???] i asked .
' [???] [???] the white [???] [???] answered [???] . [???] and he told me to say that
if you feel the need [???] he will help ; but you must seek his aid at once [???] or it
will be too late . [???]
' and that message brought me hope . for [???] the white is the
greatest of my order . [???] is [???] of course [???] a worthy [???] [???] a master of
shapes and changes of hue ; and he has much lore of herbs and beasts [???] and

birds are especially his friends . but [???] has long studied the arts of
the enemy himself [???] and thus we have often been able to forestall him . it was
by the devices of [???] that we drove him from dol [???] . it might be
that he had found some weapons that would drive back the nine .
' [???] i will go to [???] [???] [???] i sa id .
' [???] then you must go now [???] [???] said [???] ; [???] for i have wasted time in
looking for you [???] and the days are running short . i was told to find you
before [???] [???] and that is now here . even if you set out from this spot [???]
you will hardly reach him before the nine discover the land that they seek .
i myself shall turn back at once . [???] and with that he mounted and would have
ridden straight off .
` [???] stay a moment ! [???] i said . [???] we shall need your help [???] and the help of
all things that will give it . send out messages to all the beasts and birds
that are your friends . tell them to bring news of anything that bears on
this matter to [???] and [???] . let messages be sent to orthanc . [???]
` [???] i will do that [???] [???] he said [???] and rode off as if the nine were after
him .
` i could not follow him then and there . i had ridden very far already
that day [???] and i was as weary as my horse ; and i needed to consider matters .
i stayed the night in bree [???] and decided that i had no time to return to the
shire . never did i make a greater mistake !
` however [???] i wrote a message to [???] [???] and trusted to my friend the
[???] to send it to him . i rode away at dawn ; and i came at long last to
the dwelling of [???] . that is far south in [???] [???] in the end of the
misty mountains [???] not far from the gap of [???] . and [???] will tell you
that that is a great open vale that lies between the misty mountains and the
northmost [???] of ered [???] [???] the white mountains of his home . but
[???] is a circle of sheer rocks that enclose a valley as with a wall [???]
and in the midst of that valley is a tower of stone called orthanc . it was
not made by [???] [???] but by the men of n [???] menor long ago ; and it is very tall
and has many secrets ; yet it looks not to be a work of craft . it cannot be
reached save by passing the circle of [???] ; and in that circle there is
only one gate .
' late one evening i came to the gate [???] like a great arch in the wall of
rock ; and it was strongly guarded . but the keepers of the gate were on the
watch for me and told me that [???] [???] me . i rode under the arch [???] and
the gate closed silently behind me [???] and suddenly i was afraid [???] though i knew

no reason for it .
' but i rode to the foot of orthanc [???] and came to the stair of [???]
and there he met me and led me up to his high chamber . he wore a ring on his
finger .
` [???] so you have come [???] [???] [???] [???] he said to me gravely ; but in his eyes
there seemed to be a white light [???] as if a cold laughter was in his heart .
` [???] yes [???] i have come [???] [???] i said . [???] i have come for your aid [???] [???] the
white . [???] and that title seemed to anger him .
' [???] have you indeed [???] [???] the grey ! [???] he [???] . [???] for aid ? it has
seldom been heard of that [???] the grey sought for aid [???] one so cunning
and so wise [???] wandering about the lands [???] and concerning himself in every
business [???] whether it belongs to him or not . [???]
' i looked at him and wondered . [???] but if i am not deceived [???] [???] said i [???]
[???] things are now moving which will require the union of all our strength . [???]
' [???] that may be so [???] [???] he said [???] [???] but the thought is late in coming to you .
how long . i wonder [???] have you concealed from me [???] the head of the council [???] a
matter of greatest import ? what brings you now from your lurking - place in
the shire ? [???]
' [???] the nine have come forth again [???] [???] i answered . [???] they have crossed the
river . so [???] said to me . [???]
` [???] [???] the brown ! [???] laughed [???] [???] and he no longer concealed
his scorn . [???] [???] the bird - tamer ! [???] the simple ! [???] the fool !
yet he had just the wit to play the part that i set him . for you have come [???]
and that was all the purpose of my message . and here you will stay [???] [???]
the grey [???] and rest from journeys . for i am [???] the wise [???] [???]
ring - maker [???] [???] of many colours ! [???]
' i looked then and saw that his robes [???] which had seemed white [???] were not
so [???] but were woven of all colours . and if he moved they [???] and
changed hue so that the eye was [???] .
' [???] i liked white better [???] [???] i said .
' [???] white ! [???] he sneered . [???] it serves as a beginning . white cloth may be
dyed . the white page can be [???] ; and the white light can be broken . [???]
' [???] in which case it is no longer white [???] [???] said i . [???] and he that breaks a
thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom . [???]
' [???] you need not speak to me as to one of the fools that you take for
friends [???] [???] said he . [???] i have not brought you hither to be instructed by you [???]
but to give you a choice . [???]

' he drew himself up then and began to declaim [???] as if he were making a
speech long rehearsed . [???] the elder days are gone . the middle days are
passing . the younger days are beginning . the time of the elves is over [???] but
our time is at hand : the world of men [???] which we must rule . but we must have
power [???] power to order all things as we will [???] for that good which only the
wise can see .
' [???] and listen [???] [???] [???] my old friend and helper ! [???] he said [???] coming
near and speaking now in a softer voice . [???] i said we [???] for we it may be [???] if
you will join with me . a new power is rising . against it the old allies and
[???] will not avail us at all . there is no hope left in elves or dying
n [???] menor . this then is one choice before you . before us . we may jo in with
that power . it would be wise [???] [???] . there is hope that way . its victory
is at hand ; and there will be rich reward for those that aided it . as the
power grows [???] its proved friends will also grow ; and the wise [???] such as you
and i [???] may with patience come at last to direct its courses [???] to control it .
we can bide our time [???] we can keep our thoughts in our hearts [???] [???]
maybe evils done by the way [???] but approving the high and ultimate purpose :
knowledge [???] rule [???] order ; all the things that we have so far striven in vain
to accomplish [???] hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friends .
there need not be [???] there would not be [???] any real change in our designs [???] only
in our means . [???]
' [???] [???] [???] [???] i said [???] [???] i have heard speeches of this kind before [???] but
only in the mouths of [???] sent from [???] to deceive the ignorant . i
cannot think that you brought me so far only to weary my ears . [???]
' he looked at me sidelong [???] and paused a while considering . [???] well [???] i see
that this wi se course does not commend itself to you [???] [???] he said . [???] not yet ?
not if some better way can be contrived ? [???]
` he came and laid his long hand on my arm . [???] and why not [???] [???] ? [???] he
whispered . [???] why not ? the ruling ring ? if we could command that [???] then the
power would pass to us . that is in truth why i brought you here . for i have
many eyes in my service [???] and i believe that you know where this precious
thing now lies . is it not so ? or why do the nine ask for the shire [???] and what
is your business there ? [???] as he said this a lust which he could not conceal
shone suddenly in his eyes .
' [???] [???] [???] [???] i said [???] standing away from him [???] [???] only one hand at a time
can wield the one [???] and you know that well [???] so do not trouble to say we ! but
i would not give it [???] nay [???] i would not give even news of it to you [???] now that

i learn your mind . you were head of the council [???] but you have [???]
yourself at last . well [???] the choices are [???] it seems [???] to submit to [???] [???] or
to yourself . i will take neither . have you others to offer ? [???]
' he was cold now and perilous . [???] yes [???] [???] he said . [???] i did not expect you to
show wisdom [???] even in your own behalf ; but i gave you the chance of aiding me
willingly . and so saving yourself much trouble and pain . the third choice is
to stay here [???] until the end . [???]
' [???] until what end ? [???]
' [???] until you reveal to me where the one may be found . i may find means
to persuade you . or until it is found in your despite [???] and the ruler has
time to turn to lighter matters : to devise [???] say [???] a fitting reward for the
hindrance and insolence of [???] the grey . [???]
' [???] that may not prove to be one of the lighter matters [???] [???] said i . he
laughed at me [???] for my words were empty [???] and he knew it .
` they took me and they set me alone on the p innacle of orthanc [???] in the
place where [???] was accustomed to watch the stars . there is no descent
save by a narrow stair of many thousand steps [???] and the valley below seems
far away . i looked on it and saw that [???] whereas it had once been green and
fair [???] it was now filled with pits and forges . wolves and [???] were housed in
[???] [???] for [???] was mustering a great force on his own account [???] in
rivalry of [???] and not in his service yet . over all his works a dark
smoke hung and wrapped itself about the sides of orthanc . i stood alone on
an island in the clouds ; and i had no chance of escape [???] and my days were
bitter . i was pierced with cold [???] and i had but little room in which to pace
to and fro [???] brooding on the coming of the riders to the north .
` that the nine had indeed arisen i felt assured [???] apart from the words
of [???] which might be lies . long ere i came to [???] i had heard
tidings by the way that could not be mistaken . fear was ever in my heart for
my friends in the shire ; but still i had some hope . i hoped that [???] had
set forth at once [???] as my letter had urged [???] and that he had reached [???]
before the deadly pursuit began . and both my fear and my hope proved
ill - founded . for my hope was founded on a fat man in bree ; and my fear was
founded on the cunning of [???] . but fat men who sell ale have many calls
to answer ; and the power of [???] is still less than fear makes it . but in
the circle of [???] [???] trapped and alone [???] it was not easy to think that the
hunters before whom all have fled or fallen would falter in the shire far
away . '

` i saw you ! ' cried [???] . ` you were walking backwards and forwards . the
moon shone in your hair . '
[???] paused astonished and looked at him . ' i t was only a dream ' said
[???] [???] ` but it suddenly came back to me . i had quite forgotten it . it came
some time ago ; after i left the shire [???] i think . '
` then it was late in coming [???] ' said [???] [???] ' as you will see . i was in
an evil plight . and those who know me will agree that i have seldom been in
such need [???] and do not bear such misfortune well . [???] the grey caught
like a fly in a spider ' s treacherous web ! yet even the most subtle spiders
may leave a weak thread .
` at first i feared [???] as [???] no doubt intended [???] that [???] had
also fallen . yet i had caught no hint of anything wrong in his voice or in
his eye at our meeting . if i had [???] i should never have gone to [???] [???] or i
should have gone more warily . so [???] guessed [???] and he had concealed his
mind and deceived his messenger . it would have been useless in any case to
try and win over the honest [???] to treachery . he sought me in good
faith [???] and so persuaded me .
` that was the undoing of [???] ' s plot . for [???] knew no reason
why he should not do as i asked ; and he rode away towards [???] where
he
had many friends of old . and the eagles of the mountains went far and wide [???]
and they saw many things : the gathering of wolves and the mustering of [???] ;
and the nine riders going hither and thither in the lands ; and they heard
news of the escape of [???] . and they sent a messenger to bring these
tidings to me .
` so it was that when summer waned [???] there came a night of moon [???] and
[???] the windlord [???] swiftest of the great eagles [???] came [???] - for to
orthanc ; and he found me standing on the [???] . then i spoke to him and
he bore me away [???] before [???] was aware . i was far from [???] [???] ere the
wolves and [???] issued from the gate to pursue me .
` [???] how far can you bear me ? [???] i said to [???] .
` [???] many leagues [???] [???] said he [???] [???] but not to the ends of the earth . i was
sent to bear tidings not burdens . [???]
` [???] then i must have a steed on land [???] [???] i said [???] [???] and a steed [???] [???]
swift [???] for i have never had such need of haste before . [???]
` [???] then i will bear you to [???] [???] where the lord of [???] sits in his
halls [???] [???] he said ; [???] for that is not very far off . [???] and i was glad [???] for in the

[???] of [???] the [???] [???] the horse - lords [???] dwell [???] and there are no
horses like those that are bred in that great vale between the misty
mountains and the white .
` [???] are the men of [???] still to be trusted [???] do you think ? [???] i said to
[???] [???] for the treason of [???] had shaken my faith .
` [???] they pay a tribute of horses [???] [???] he answered [???] [???] and send many yearly to
[???] [???] or so it is said ; but they are not yet under the yoke . but if
[???] has become evil [???] as you say [???] then their doom cannot be long
delayed . [???]
` he set me down in the land of [???] ere dawn ; and now i have
lengthened my tale over long . the rest must be more brief . in [???] i found
evil already at work : the lies of [???] ; and the king of the land would
not listen to my warnings . he bade me take a horse and be gone ; and i chose
one much to my liking . but little to his . i took the best horse in his land [???]
and i have never seen the like of him . '
' then he must be a noble beast indeed [???] ' said [???] ; ' and it grieves
me more than many tidings that might seem worse to learn that [???] [???]
such tribute . it was not so when last i was in that land . '
` nor is it now [???] i will swear [???] ' said [???] . ` it is a lie that comes
from the enemy . i know the men of [???] ; true a nd valiant [???] our allies [???]
dwelling still in the lands that we gave them long ago . '
` the shadow of [???] lies on distant lands [???] ' answered [???] .
' [???] has fallen under it . [???] is beset . who knows what you will find
there [???] if ever you return ? '
` not this at least . ' said [???] [???] ' that they will buy their lives with
horses . they love their horses next to their kin . and not without reason [???]
for the horses of the [???] come from the fields of the north [???] far from
the shadow . and their race [???] as that of their masters [???] is descended from the
free days of old . '
' true indeed ! ' said [???] . ` and there is one among them that might
have been [???] in the morning of the world . the horses of the nine cannot
vie with him ; tireless [???] swift as the flowing wind . [???] they called
him . by day his coat [???] like silver ; and by night it is like a shade [???]
and he passes unseen . light is his footfall ! never before had any man
mounted him [???] but i took him and i tamed him [???] and so speedily he bore me that
i reached the shire when [???] was on the barrow - downs [???] though i set out
from [???] only when he set out from [???] .

' but fear grew in me as i rode . ever as i came north i heard tidings of
the riders [???] and though i gained on them day by day [???] they were ever before
me . they had divided their forces [???] i learned : some remained on the eastern
borders [???] not far from the greenway . and some invaded the shire from the
south . i came to [???] and [???] had gone ; but i had words with old
[???] . many words and few to the point . he had much to say about the
[???] of the new owners of bag end .
` [???] i can ' t abide changes [???] [???] said he [???] [???] not at my time of life [???] and least
of all changes for the worst . [???] [???] changes for the worst [???] [???] he repeated many
times .
' [???] worst is a bad word [???] [???] i said to him [???] [???] and i hope you do not live to
see it . [???] but [???] his talk i gathered at last that [???] had left [???]
less than a week before [???] and that a black horseman had come to the hill the
same evening . then i rode on in fear . i came to buckland and found it in
[???] [???] as busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred with a stick . i came
to the house at [???] [???] and it was broken open and empty ; but on the
[???] there lay a cloak that had been [???] ' s . then for a while hope
left me [???] and i did not wait to gather news [???] or i might have been comforted ;
but i rode on the trail of the riders . it was hard to follow [???] for it went
many ways [???] and i was at a loss . but it seemed to me that one or two had
ridden towards bree ; and that way i went [???] for i thought of words that might
be said to the [???] .
' [???] [???] they call him [???] [???] thought i . [???] if this delay was his fault [???] i
will melt all the butter in him . i will roast the old fool over a slow
fire . [???] he expected no less [???] and when he saw my face he fell down flat and
began to melt on the spot . '
` what did you do to him ? ' cried [???] in alarm . ' he was really very
kind to us and did a ll that he could . '
[???] laughed . ' don ' t be afraid ! ' he said . ` i did not bite [???] and i
barked very little . so [???] was i by the news that i got out of him [???]
when he stopped quaking [???] that i embraced the old fellow . how it happened i
could not then guess [???] but i learned that you had been in bree the night
before [???] and had gone off that morning with strider .
` [???] strider ! [???] i cried [???] shouting for joy .
` [???] yes [???] sir [???] i am afraid so [???] sir [???] [???] said [???] [???] mistaking me . [???] he
got at them [???] in spite of all that i could do [???] and they took up with him .
they behaved very queer all the time they were here : wilful [???] you might say . [???]

` [???] ass ! fool ! thrice worthy and beloved [???] ! [???] said i . [???] it ' s the
best news i have had since [???] : it ' s worth a gold piece at the least .
may your beer be laid under an enchantment of [???] excellence for
seven years ! [???] said i . [???] now i can take a night ' s rest [???] the first since i
have forgotten when . [???]
` so i stayed there that night [???] wondering much what had become of the
riders ; for only of two had there yet been any news in bree [???] it seemed . but
in the night we heard more . five at least came from the west [???] and they threw
down the gates and passed through bree like a howling wi nd ; and the
bree - folk are still shivering and expecting the end of the world . i got up
before dawn and went after them .
' i do not know [???] but it seems clear to me that this is what happened .
their captain remained in secret away south of bree [???] while two rode ahead
through the village [???] and four more invaded the shire . but when these were
foiled in bree and at [???] [???] they returned to their captain with
tidings [???] and so left the road [???] for a while [???] except by their spies .
the captain then sent some eastward straight across country [???] and he himself
with the rest rode along the road in great wrath .
' i [???] to [???] like a gale [???] and i reached it before sundown
on my second day from bree - and they were there befor e me . they drew
away
from me [???] for they felt the coming of my anger and they dared not face it
while the sun was in the sky . but they closed round at night [???] and i was
[???] on the hill - top [???] in the old ring of amon syl . i was hard put to it
indeed : such light and flame cannot have been seen on [???] since the
war - [???] of old .
` at [???] i escaped and fled towards the north . i could not hope to
do more . it was impossible to find you [???] [???] [???] in the wilderness [???] and it
would ha ve been folly to try with all the nine at my heels . so i had to
trust to [???] . but i hoped to draw some of them off [???] and yet reach
[???] ahead of you and send out help . four riders did indeed follow me [???]
but they turned back after a wh ile and made for the ford [???] it seems . that
helped a little [???] for there were only five [???] not nine [???] when your camp was
attacked .
' i reached here at last by a long hard road [???] up the [???] and
through the [???] [???] and down from the north . it took me nearly fourteen
days from [???] [???] for i could not ride among the rocks of the

troll - fells [???] and [???] departed . i sent him back to his master ; but a
great friendship has grown between us [???] and if i have need he will come at my
call . but so it was that i came to [???] only three days before the
ring [???] and news of its peril had already been brought here - which proved well
indeed .
` and that [???] [???] [???] is the end of my account . may [???] and the others
forgive the length of it . but such a thing has not happened before [???] that
[???] broke tryst and did not come when he promised . an account to the
ring - bearer of so strange an event was required [???] i think .
' well [???] the tale is now told [???] from first to last . here we all are [???] and
here is the ring . but we have not yet come any nearer to our purpose . what
shall we do with it ? '
there was silence . at last [???] spoke again .
` this is grievous news concerning [???] [???] ' he said ; ` for we trusted
him and he is deep in all our counsels . it is perilous to study too deeply
the arts of the enemy [???] for good or for ill . but such falls and betrayals [???]
alas [???] have happened before . of the tales that we have heard this day the
tale of [???] was most strange to me . i have known few [???] [???] save [???]
here ; and it seems to me that he is perhaps not so alone and singular as i
had thought him . the world has changed much since i last was on the
westward
roads .
` the barrow - [???] we know by many names ; and of the old forest
many
tales have been told : all that now remains is but an outlier of its northern
march . time was when a [???] could go from tree to tree from what is now
the shire to dunland west of [???] . in those lands i journeyed once [???] and
many things wild and strange i knew . but i had forgotten [???] [???] if indeed
this is still the same that walked the woods and hills long ago [???] and even
then was older than the old . that was not then his name . [???] ben - adar we
called him [???] oldest and fatherless . but many another name he has since been
given by other folk : forn by the [???] [???] orald by northern men [???] and other
names beside . he is a strange creature [???] but maybe i should have summoned
him
to our council . '
` he would not have come [???] ' said [???] .
` could we not still send messages to him and obtain his help ? ' asked

[???] . ` it seems that he has a power even over the ring . '
` no [???] i should not put it so [???] ' said [???] . ` say rather that the ring
has no power over him . he is his own master . but he cannot alter the ring
itself [???] nor break its power over others . and now he is withdrawn into a
little land [???] within bounds that he has set [???] though none can see them [???]
waiting perhaps for a change of days [???] and he will not step beyond them . '
` but within those bounds nothing seems to dismay him [???] ' said [???] .
` would he not take the ring and keep it there [???] for ever harmless ? '
` no [???] ' said [???] [???] ` not willingly . he might do so [???] if all the free
folk of the world begged him [???] but he would not understand the need . and if
he were given the ring [???] he would soon forget it [???] or most likely throw it
away . such things have no hold on his mind . he would be a most unsafe
guardian ; and that alone is answer enough . '
` but in any case [???] ' said [???] [???] ` to send the ring to him would only
[???] the day of evil . he is far away . we could not now take it back to
him [???] [???] [???] [???] by any spy . and even if we could [???] soon or late the
lord of the rings wou ld learn of its hiding place and would bend all his
power towards it . could that power be defied by [???] alone ? i think not .
i think that in the end [???] if all else is conquered [???] [???] will fall [???] last
as he was first ; and then night will come . '
` i know little of [???] save the name [???] ' said [???] ; ` but [???] [???]
i think [???] is right . power to defy our enemy is not in him [???] unless such power
is in the earth itself . and yet we see that [???] can torture and destroy
the very hills . what power still remains lies with us [???] here in [???] [???] or
with [???] at the havens [???] or in [???] . but have they the strength [???] have we
here the strength to withstand the enemy [???] the coming of [???] at the last [???]
when all else is overthrown ? '
` i have not the strength [???] ' said [???] ; ` neither have they . '
` then if the ring cannot be kept from him for ever by strength ' said
[???] [???] ` two things only remain for us to attempt : to send it over the
sea [???] or to destroy it . '
` but [???] has revealed to u s that we cannot destroy it by any craft
that we here possess [???] ' said [???] . ` and they who dwell beyond the sea would
not receive it : for good or ill it belongs to middle - earth ; it is for us who
still dwell here to deal with it . '
' then [???] said [???] [???] ' let us cast it into the deeps [???] and so make the
lies of [???] come true . for it is clear now that even at the council his

feet were already on a crooked path . he knew that the ring was not lost for
ever [???] but wished us to think so ; for he began to lust for it for himself .
yet oft in lies truth is hidden : in the sea it would be safe . '
` not safe for ever [???] ' said [???] . ` there are many things in the deep
waters ; and seas and lands may change . and it is not our part here to take
thought only for a season [???] or for a few lives of men [???] or for a passing age
of the world . we should seek a final end of this menace [???] even if we do not
hope to make one . '
' and that we shall not find on the roads to the sea [???] ' said [???] . ' if
the return to [???] be thought too dangerous [???] then flight to the s [???] a is
now fraught with gravest peril . my heart tells me that [???] will expect us
to take the western way [???] when he learns what has befallen . he soon will . the
nine have been [???] indeed but that is but a respite [???] ere they find new
steeds and swifter . only the waning might of [???] stands now between him
and a march in power along the coasts into the north ; and if he comes [???]
assailing the white towers and the havens [???] hereafter the elves may have no
escape from the lengthening shadows of middle - earth . '
' long yet will that march be delayed [???] ' said [???] . ' [???] wanes [???] you
say . but [???] stands [???] and even the end of its strength is still very
strong . '
' and yet its [???] can no longer keep back the nine [???] ' said [???] .
' and other roads he may find that [???] does not guard . '
' then [???] ' said [???] [???] ` there are but two courses [???] as [???] already
has declared : to hide the ring for ever ; or to unmake it . but both are
beyond our power . who will read this riddle for us ? '
' none here can do so [???] ' said [???] gravely . ` at least none can foretell
what will come to pass [???] if we take this road or that . but it seems to me now
clear which is the road that we must take . the westward road seems easiest .
therefore it must be shunned . it will be watched . too often the elves have
fled that way . now at this last we must take a hard road [???] a road [???] .
there lies our hope [???] if hope it be . to walk into peril - to [???] . we must
send the ring to the fire . '
silence fell again . [???] [???] even in that fair house [???] looking out upon a
[???] valley filled with the noise of clear waters [???] felt a dead darkness in
his heart . [???] stirred [???] and [???] looked at him . he was finger ing his
great horn and frowning . at length he spoke .
' i do not understand all this [???] ' he said . ` [???] is a traitor [???] but did

he not have a glimpse of wisdom ? why do you speak ever of hiding and
destroying ? why should we not think that the great ring has come into our
hands to serve us in the very hour of need ? [???] it the free lords of
the free may surely defeat the enemy . that is what he most fears [???] i deem .
' the men of [???] are valiant [???] and they will never submit ; but they
may be beaten down . valour needs first strength [???] and then a weapon . let the
ring be your weapon [???] if it has such power as you say . take it and go forth
to victory ! '
' alas [???] no [???] ' said [???] . ' we cannot use the ruling ring . that we now
know too well . it belongs to [???] and was made by him alone [???] and is
altogether evil . its strength [???] [???] [???] is too great for anyone to wield at
will [???] save only those who have already a great power of their own . but for
them it holds an even deadlier peril . the very desire of it corrupts the
heart . consider [???] . if any of the wise should with this ring overthrow
the lord of [???] [???] using his own arts [???] he would then set himself on
[???] ' s throne [???] and yet another dark lord would appear . and that is another
reason why the ring should be destroyed : as long as it is in the world it
will be a danger even to the wise . for nothing is evil in the beginning .
even [???] was not so . i fear to take the ring to hide it . i will not take
the ring to wield it . '
` nor i [???] ' said [???] .
[???] looked at them doubtfully [???] but he bowed his head . ` so be it [???] '
he said . ` then in [???] we must trust to such weapons as we have . and at
the least [???] while the wise ones guard this ring [???] we will fight on . [???] the
sword - that - was - broken may still stem the tide - - if the hand that [???] it
has inherited not an [???] only [???] but the sinews of the kings of men . '
` who can tell ? ' said [???] . ` but we will put it to the test one day . '
` may the day not be too long delayed [???] ' said [???] . ' for though i do
not ask for aid [???] we need it . it would comfort us to know that others fought
also with all the means that they have . '
` then be comforted [???] ' said [???] . ` for there are other powers and
realms that you know not [???] and they are hidden from you . [???] the great
flows past many shores [???] ere it comes to [???] and the gates of [???] . '
' still it might be well for all [???] ' said [???] the dwarf [???] ' if all these
strengths were joined [???] and the powers of each were used in league . other
rings there may be [???] less treacherous [???] that might be used in our need . the
seven are lost to us - - if balin has not found the ring of thrur which was

the last ; naught has been heard of it since thrur perished in moria . indeed
i may now reveal that it was partly in hope to find that ring that balin
went away . '
` balin will find no ring in moria [???] ' said [???] . ` thrur gave it to
[???] his son [???] but not [???] to [???] . it was taken with torment from
[???] in the dungeons of dol [???] . i came too late . '
' ah [???] alas ! ' cried [???] . ' when will the day come of our revenge ? but
still there are the three . what of the three rings of the elves ? very mighty
rings [???] it is said . do not the elf - lords keep them ? yet they too were made by
the dark lord long ago . are they idle ? i see elf - lords here . will they not
say ? '
the elves returned no answer . ` did you not hear me [???] [???] ? ' said
[???] . ` the three were not made by [???] [???] nor did he ever touch them . but
of them it is not permitted to speak . so much only in this ' hour of doubt i
may now say . they are not idle . but they were not made as weapons of war or
conquest : that is not their power . those who made them did not desire
strength or domination or hoarded wealth [???] but understanding [???] making [???] and
healing [???] to preserve all things unstained . these things the elves of
middle - earth have in some measure gained [???] though with sorrow . but all that
has been wrought by those who wield the three will turn to their undoing [???]
and their minds and hearts will become revealed to [???] [???] if he regains the
one . it would be better if the three had never been . that is his purpose . '
` but what then would happen [???] if the ruling ring were destroyed as you
counsel ? ' asked [???] .
' we know not for certain [???] ' answered [???] sadly . ` some hope that the
three rings [???] which [???] has never touched [???] would then become free [???] and
their rulers might heal the hurts of the world that he has wrought . but
maybe when the one has gone [???] the three will fail [???] and many fair things will
fade and be forgotten . that is my belief . '
` yet all the elves are willing to endure this chance [???] ' said [???]
' if by it the power of [???] may be broken [???] and the fear of his dominion be
taken away for ever . '
' thus we return once more to the destroying of the ring [???] ' said [???] [???]
` and yet we come no nearer . what strength have we for the finding of the
fire in which it was made ? that is the path of despair . of folly i would
say [???] if the long wisdom of [???] did not forbid me . '
' despair [???] or folly ? ' said [???] . ` it is not despair [???] for despair is

only for those who see the end beyond all doubt . we do not . it is wisdom to
recognize necessity [???] when all other courses have been weighed [???] though as
folly it may appear to those who cling to false hope . well [???] let folly be our
cloak [???] a veil before the eyes of the enemy ! for he is very wise [???] and weighs
all things to a nicety in the scales of his malice . but the only measure
that he knows is desire [???] desire for power ; and so he judges all hearts . into
his heart the thought will not enter that any will refuse it [???] that having
the ring we may seek to destroy it . if we seek this [???] we shall put him out of
reckoning . '
' at least for a while [???] ' said [???] . ` the road must be trod [???] but it
will be very hard . and neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon
it . this quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong .
yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world : small
hands do them because they must [???] while the eyes of the great are elsewhere . '
' very well [???] very well [???] master [???] ! ' said [???] suddenly . ' say no
more ! it is plain enough what you are pointing at . [???] the silly hobbit
started this affair [???] and [???] had better finish it [???] or himself . i was very
comfortable here [???] and getting on with my book . if you want to know [???] i am
just writing an ending for it . i had thought of putting : and he lived
happily ever afterwards to the end of his days . it is a good ending [???] and
none the worse for having been used before . now i shall have to alter that :
it does not look like coming true ; and anyway there will evidently have to
be several more chapters [???] if i live to write them . it is a frightful
[???] . when ought i to start ?
' [???] looked in surprise at [???] [???] but the laughter died on his
lips when he saw that all the others regarded the old hobbit with grave
respect . only [???] smiled [???] but his smile came from old memories .
` of course [???] my dear [???] [???] ' said [???] . ` if you had really started
this affair [???] you might be expected to finish it . but you know well enough
now that starting is too great a claim for any [???] and that only a small part
is played in great deeds by any hero . you need not bow ! though the word was
meant [???] and we do not doubt that under jest you are making a valiant offer .
but one beyond your strength [???] [???] . you cannot take this thing back . it has
passed on . if you need my advice any longer [???] i should say that your part is
ended [???] unless as a recorder . finish your book [???] and leave the ending
[???] ! there is still hope for it . but get ready to write a [???] [???] when
they come back . '

[???] laughed . ` i have never known you give me pleasant advice before . '
he said . ` as all your [???] advice has been good [???] i wonder if this
advice is not bad . still [???] i don ' t suppose i have the strength or luck left
to deal with the ring . it has grown [???] and i have not . but tell me : what do
you mean by they ? '
` the messengers who are sent with the ring . '
` exactly ! and who are they to be ? that seems to me what this council
has to decide [???] and all that it has to decide . elves may thrive on speech
alone [???] and [???] endure great weariness ; but i am only an old hobbit [???] and
i miss my meal at noon . can ' t you think of some names now ? or put it off
till after dinner ? '
no one answered . the noon - bell rang . still no one spoke . [???] glanced
at all the faces [???] but they were not turned to him . all the council sat with
downcast eyes [???] as if in deep thought . a great dread fell on him [???] as if he
was [???] the pronouncement of some doom that he had long foreseen and
vainly hoped might after all never be spoken . an overwhelming longing to
rest and remain at peace by [???] ' s side in [???] filled all his heart .
at last with an effort he spoke [???] and wondered to hear his own words [???] as if
some other will was using his small voice .
` i will take the ring [???] ' he said [???] ` though i do not know the way . '
[???] raised his eyes and looked at him [???] and [???] felt his heart
pierced by the sudden keenness of the glance . ` if i understand aright all
that i have heard [???] ' he said [???] ` i think that this task is appointed for you [???]
[???] ; and that if you do not find a way [???] no one will . this is the hour of
the shire - folk [???] when they arise from their quiet fields to shake the towers
and counsels of the great . who of all the wise could have foreseen it ? or [???]
if they are wise [???] why should they expect to know it [???] until the hour has
struck ?
` but it is a heavy burden . so heavy that none could lay it on another .
i do not lay it on you . but if you take it freely [???] i will say that your
choice is right ; and though all the mighty elf - friends of old [???] hador [???] and
h [???] rin [???] and t [???] rin [???] and beren himself were assembled together your seat
should
be among them . '
` but you won ' t send him off alone surely [???] mast er ? ' cried sam [???] unable to
contain himself any longer [???] and jumping up from the corner where he had been
quietly sitting on the floor .

` no indeed ! ' said [???] [???] turning towards him with a smile . ` you at
least shall go with him . it is hardly possi ble to separate you from him [???]
even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not . '
sam sat down [???] blushing and muttering . ` a nice pickle we have landed
ourselves in [???] mr . [???] ! ' he said [???] shaking his head .




chapter 3 . the ring goes south



later that day the [???] held a meeting of their own in [???] ' s room .
merry and [???] were indignant when they heard that sam had crept into the
council [???] and had been chosen as [???] ' s companion .
` it ' s most unfair [???] ' said [???] . ` [???] d of throwing him out [???] and
clapping him in chains [???] [???] goes and rewards him for his cheek ! '
` rewards ! ' said [???] . ' i can ' t imagine a more severe punishment . you
are not thinking what you are saying : condemned to go on this hopeless
journey [???] a reward ? yesterday i dreamed that my task was done [???] and i could
rest here [???] a long while [???] perhaps for good . '
' i don ' t wonder [???] ' said merry [???] ' and i wish you could . but we are envying
sam [???] not you . if you have to go [???] then it will be a punishment for any of us
to be left behind [???] even in [???] . we have come a long way with you and
been through some stiff times . we want to go on . '
` that ' s what i meant [???] ' said [???] . ` we [???] ought to stick
together [???] and we will . i shall go [???] unless they chain me up . there must be
someone with intelligence in the party . '
' then you certainly will not be chosen [???] [???] took ! ' said [???] [???]
looking in through the window [???] which was near the ground . ` but you are all
[???] yourselves [???] . nothing is decided yet . '
` nothing decided ! ' cried [???] . ' then what were you all doing ? you
were shut up for hours . '
[???] talking [???] ' said [???] . ` there was a deal of talk [???] and everyone had an
eye - opener . even old [???] . i think legolas ' s bit of news about [???]
caught even him on the hop [???] though he passed it off . '
` you were wrong [???] ' said [???] . ' you were [???] . i had already
heard of it from [???] . if you want to know [???] the only real eye - openers [???] as
you put it [???] were you and [???] ; and i was the only one that was not
surprised . '
` well [???] anyway [???] ' said [???] [???] ' nothing was decided beyond choosing poor
[???] and sam . i was afraid all the time that it might come to that [???] if i
was let off . but if you ask me [???] [???] will send out a fair number [???] when the
reports come in . have they started yet [???] [???] ? '
' yes [???] ' said the [???] . ` some of the scouts have been sent out already .

more will go tomorrow . [???] is sending elves [???] and they will get in touch
with the rangers [???] and maybe with [???] ' s folk in [???] . and
[???]
has gone with [???] ' s sons . we shall have to scour the lands all round for
many long leagues before any move is made . so cheer up [???] [???] ! you will
probably make quite a long stay here . '
' ah ! ' said sam [???] . ' we ' ll just wait long enough for winter to
come . '
' that can ' t be helped [???] ' said [???] . ' it ' s your fault partly [???] [???] my
lad : insisting on waiting for my birthday . a funny way of honouring it [???] i
can ' t help thinking . not the day i should have chosen for letting the s . - b . s
into bag end . but there it is : you can ' t wait now fill spring ; and you can ' t
go till the reports come back .
when winter first begins to bite
and stones crack in the frosty night [???]
when [???] are black and trees are bare [???]
' tis evil in the wild to fare .
but that i am afraid will be just your luck . '
' i am afraid it will [???] ' said [???] . ' we can ' t start until we have
found out about the riders . '
` i thought they were all destroyed in the flood [???] ' said merry .
' you cannot destroy [???] like that [???] ' said [???] . ` the power of
their master is in them [???] and they stand or fall by him . we hope that they
were all [???] and [???] [???] and so made for a while less dangerous ; but
we must find out for certain . in the meantime you should try and forget your
troubles [???] [???] . i do not know if i can do anything to help you ; but i will
whisper this in your ears . someone said that intelligence would be needed in
the party . he was right . i think i shall come with you . '
so great was [???] ' s delight at this announcement that [???] left the
window - sill [???] where he had been sitting [???] and took off his hat and bowed . ' i
only said i think i shall come . do not count on anything yet . in this matter
[???] will have much to say [???] and your friend the strider . which reminds me [???]
i want to see [???] . i must be off . '
` how long do you think i shall have here ? ' said [???] to [???] when
[???] had gone .
` oh [???] i don ' t know . i can ' t count days in [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' but
quite long [???] i should think . we can have many a good talk . what about helping

me with my book [???] and making a start on the next ? have you thought of an
ending ? '
' yes [???] several [???] a nd all are dark and [???] [???] ' said [???] .
' oh [???] that won ' t do ! ' said [???] . ` books ought to have good endings . how
would this do : and they all settled down and lived together happily ever
after ? '
` it will do well [???] if it ever comes to that [???] ' said [???] .
' ah ! ' said sam . ' and where will they live ? that ' s what i often wonder . '
for a while the [???] continued to talk and think of the past journey
and of the perils that lay ahead ; but such was the virtue of the land of
[???] that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted from their minds . the
future [???] good or ill [???] was not forgotten [???] but ceased to have any power over
the present . health and hope grew strong in them [???] and they were content with
each good day as it came [???] taking plea sure in every meal [???] and in every word
and song .
so the days slipped away [???] as each morning [???] bright and fair [???] and
each evening followed cool and clear . but autumn was waning fast ; slowly the
golden light faded to pale silver [???] and the lingering leaves fell from the
naked trees . a wind began to blow chill from the misty mountains to the
east . the hunter ' s moon waxed round in the night sky [???] and put to flight all
the lesser stars . but low in the south one star shone red . every night [???] as
the moon waned again [???] it shone brighter and brighter . [???] could see it
from his window [???] deep in the heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared
above the trees on the brink of the valley .
the [???] had been nearly two months in the house of [???] [???] and
[???] had gone by with the last shreds of autumn [???] and december was
passing [???] when the scouts began to return . some had gone north beyond the
springs of the [???] into the [???] ; and others had gone west [???] and
with the help of [???] and the rangers had searched the lands far down the
[???] [???] as far as [???] [???] where the old north road crossed the river by
a ruined town . many had gone east and south ; and some of these had crossed
the mountains and entered [???] [???] while others had climbed the pass at the
source of the gladden river [???] and had come down into wilderland and over the
gladden fields and so at length had reached the old home of [???] at
[???] . [???] was not there ; and they had returned over the high pass
that was called the [???] stair . the sons of [???] [???] [???] and [???] [???]
were the last to return ; they had made a great journey [???] passing down the

[???] into a strange country [???] but of their errand they would not speak
to any save to [???] .
in no region had the messengers discovered any signs or tidings of the
riders or other servants of the enemy . even from the eagles of the misty
mountains they had learned no fresh news . nothing had been seen or heard of
[???] ; but the wild wolves were still gathering [???] and were hunting again far
up the great river . three of the black horses had been found at once drowned
in the flooded ford . on the rocks of the rapids below it searchers
discovered the bodies of five more [???] and also a long black cloak [???] [???] and
[???] . of the black riders no other trace was to be seen [???] and nowhere was
their presence to be felt . it seemed that they had vanished from the north .
' eight out of the nine are accounted for at least [???] ' said [???] . ' it
is rash to be too sure [???] yet i think that we may hope now that the
[???] were scattered [???] and have been obliged to return as best they
could to their master in [???] [???] empty and shapeless .
` if that is so [???] it wi ll be some time before they can begin the hunt
again . of course the enemy has other servants [???] but they will have to journey
all the way to the borders of [???] before they can pick up our trail .
and if we are careful that will be hard to find . but we must delay no
longer . '
[???] summoned the [???] to him . he looked gravely at [???] . ' the
time has come [???] ' he said . ` if the ring is to set out [???] it must go soon . but
those who go with it must not count on their errand being aided by war or
force . they must pass into the domain of the enemy far from aid . do you
still hold to your word [???] [???] [???] that you will be the ring - bearer ? '
' i do [???] ' said [???] . ` i will go with sam . '
` then i cannot help you much [???] not even with counsel [???] ' said [???] . ` i
can foresee very little of your road ; and how your task is to be achieved i
do not know . the shadow has crept now to the feet of the mountains [???] and
draws nigh even to the borders of [???] ; and under the shadow all is
dark to me . you will meet many foes [???] some open [???] and some disguised ; and
you
may find friends upon your way when you least look for it . i will send out
messages [???] such as i can contrive [???] to those whom i know in the wide world ;
but so perilous are the lands now become that some may well miscarry [???] or
come no quicker than you yourself .
` and i will choose you companions to go with you [???] as far as they will

or fortune allows . the number must be few [???] since your hope is in speed and
secrecy . had i a host of elves in armour of the elder days [???] it would avail
little [???] save to arouse the power of [???] .
` the company of the ring shall be nine ; and the nine walkers shall be
set against the nine riders that are evil . with you and your faithful
servant [???] [???] will go ; for this shall be his great task [???] and maybe the
end of his labours .
` for the rest [???] they shall represent the other free peoples of the
world : elves [???] [???] [???] and men . legolas shall be for the elves ; and [???]
son of [???] for the [???] . they are willing to go at least to the passes
of the mountains [???] and maybe beyond . for men you shall have [???] son of
[???] [???] for the ring of [???] concerns him closely . '
` strider ! ' said [???] .
' yes [???] ' he said with a smile . ` i ask leave once again to be your
companion [???] [???] . '
` i would have begged you to come [???] ' said [???] [???] ' only i thought you were
going to minas [???] with [???] . '
` i am [???] ' said [???] . ` and the sword - that - was - broken shall be [???]
ere i set out to war . but your road and our road lie together for many
hundreds of miles . therefore [???] will also be in the company . he is a
valiant man . '
' there remain two more to be found [???] ' said [???] . [???] these i will
consider . of my household i may find some that it seems good to me to send . '
` but that will leave no place for us ! ' cried [???] in dismay . ` we
don ' t want to be left behind . we want to go with [???] . '
` that is because you do not understand a nd cannot imagine what lies
ahead [???] ' said [???] .
` neither does [???] [???] ' said [???] [???] [???] supporting [???] .
' nor do any of us see clearly . it is true that if these [???] understood
the danger [???] they would not dare to go . but they wou ld still wish to go [???] or
wish that they dared [???] and be shamed and unhappy . i think [???] [???] [???] that in
this matter it would be well to trust rather to their friendship than to
great wisdom . even if you chose for us an elf - lord [???] such as [???] [???] he
could not storm the dark tower [???] nor open the road to the fire by the power
that is in him . '
` you speak gravely [???] ' said [???] [???] ` but i am in doubt . the shire [???] i
[???] [???] is not free now from peril ; and these two i had thought to send

back there as messengers [???] to do what they could [???] according to the fashion of
their country [???] to warn the people of their danger . in any case [???] i judge that
the younger of these two [???] [???] took [???] should remain . my heart is against
his going . '
` then [???] master [???] [???] you will have to lock me in prison [???] or send me
home tied in a sack [???] ' said [???] . ` for otherwise i shall follow the
company . '
` let it be so then . you shall go [???] ' said [???] [???] and he sighed . ' now the
tale of nine is filled . in seven days the company must depart . '
the sword of [???] was forged anew by elvish smiths [???] and on its blade
was traced a device of seven stars set between the [???] moon and the
rayed sun [???] and about them was written many runes ; for [???] son of
[???] was going to war upon the marches of [???] . very bright was that
sword when it was made whole again ; the light of the sun shone redly in it [???]
and the light of the moon shone cold [???] and its edge was hard and keen . and
[???] gave it a new name and called it and [???] ril [???] flame of the west .
[???] and [???] walked together or sat speaking of their road and
the perils they would meet ; and they pondered the storied and figured maps
and books of lore that were in the house of [???] . sometimes [???] was with
them ; but he was content to lean on their [???] [???] and he spent as much
time as he could with [???] .
in those last days the [???] sat together in the evening in the hall
of fire [???] and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of beren
and l [???] thien and the winning of the great jewel ; but in the day [???] while merry
and [???] were out and about [???] [???] and sam were to be found with [???] in
his own small room . then [???] would read passages from his book ( which
still seemed very incomplete ) . or scraps of his verses [???] or would take notes
of [???] ' s adventures .
on the morning of the last day [???] was alone with [???] [???] and the old
hobbit pulled out from under his bed a wooden box . he lifted the lid and
[???] inside .
' here is your sword [???] ' he said . ' but it was broken [???] you know . i took it
to keep it safe but i ' ve forgotten to ask if the smiths could mend it . no
time now . . so i thought [???] perhaps [???] you would care to have this [???] don ' t you
know ? '
he took from the box a small sword in an old [???] leathern [???] .
then he drew it [???] and its polished and well - tended blade glittered suddenly [???]

cold and bright . ' this is sting [???] ' he said [???] and thrust it with little effort
deep into a wooden beam . ` take it [???] if you like . i shan ' t want it again [???] i
expect . '
[???] accepted it gratefully .
' also there is this ! ' said [???] [???] bringing out a parcel which seemed to
be rather heavy for its size . he unwound several folds of old cloth [???] and
held up a small shirt of mail . it was close - woven of many rings [???] as supple
almost as linen [???] cold as ice [???] and harder than steel . it shone like [???]
silver [???] and was studded with white gems . with it was a belt of pearl and
crystal .
' it ' s a pretty thing [???] isn ' t it ? ' said [???] [???] moving it in the light .
` and useful . it is my dwarf - mail that [???] gave me . i got it back from
michel delving before i started [???] and packed it with my [???] : i brought
all the [???] of my journey away with me [???] except the ring . but i did not
expect to use this [???] and i don ' t need it now [???] except to look at sometimes .
you hardly feel any weight when you put it on . '
` i should look - - well [???] i don ' t think i should look right in it [???] ' said
[???] .
` just what i sa id myself [???] ' said [???] . ' but never mind about looks . you
can wear it under your outer clothes . come on ! you must share this secret
with me . don ' t tell anybody else ! but i should feel happier if i knew you
were wearing it . i have a fancy it would turn even the knives of the black
riders [???] ' he ended in a low voice .
` very well [???] i will take it [???] ' said [???] . [???] put it on him [???] and
fastened sting upon the glittering belt ; and then [???] put over the top his
old weather - stained breeches [???] tunic [???] and jacket .
' just a plain hobbit you look [???] ' said [???] . ' but there is more about
you now than appears on the surface . good luck to you ! ' he turned away and
looked out of the window [???] trying to hum a tune .
' i cannot thank you as i should [???] [???] [???] for this [???] and for all our past
kindnesses [???] ' said [???] .
' don ' t try ! ' said the old hobbit [???] turning round and slapping him on the
back . ` ow ! ' he cried . ` you are too hard now to slap ! but there you are :
[???] must stick together [???] and especially [???] . all i ask in return
is : take as much care of yourself as you can . and bring back all the news
you can [???] and any old songs and tales you can come by . i ' ll do my best to
finish my book before you return . i should like to write the second book [???] if

i am spared . ' he broke off and turned to the window again [???] singing softly .

i sit beside the fire and think
of all that i have seen [???]
of [???] - flowers and [???]
in summers that have been ;

of yellow leaves and [???]
in [???] that there were [???]
with morning mist and silver sun
and wind upon my hair .

i sit beside the fire and think
of how the world will be
when winter comes without a spring
that i shall ever see .

for still there are so many things
that i have never seen :
in every wood in every spring
there is a different green .

i sit beside the fire and think
of people long ago [???]
and people who will see a world
that i shall never know .

but all the while i sit and think
of times there were before [???]
i listen for returning feet
and voices at the door .

it was a cold grey day near the end of december . the east wind was
streaming through the bare branches of the trees [???] and seething in the dark
pines on the hills . ragged clouds were hurrying overhead [???] dark and low . as
the cheerless shadows of the early evening began to fall the company made
ready to set out . they were to start at [???] [???] for [???] counselled them to

journey under cover of night as often as they could [???] until they were far
from [???] .
` you should fear the many eyes of the servants of [???] [???] ' he said . ' i
do not doubt that news of the [???] of the riders has already reached
him [???] and he will be filled with wrath . soon now his spies on foot and wing
will be abroad in the northern lands . even of the sky above you must beware
as you go on your way . '
the company took little gear of war [???] for their hope was in secrecy not
in battle . [???] had and [???] ril but no other weapon [???] and he went forth clad
only in rusty green and brown . as a ranger of the wilderness . [???] had a
long sword [???] in fashion like and [???] ril but of less lineage and he bore also a
shield and his war - horn .
' loud and clear it sounds in the [???] of the hills [???] ' he said [???] ` and
then let all the foes of [???] flee ! ' putting it to his lips he blew a
blast [???] and the echoes leapt from rock to rock [???] and all that heard that voice
in [???] sprang to their feet .
slow should you be to wind that horn again [???] [???] [???] said [???] .
' until you stand once more on the borders of your land [???] and dire need is on
you . '
` maybe [???] ' said [???] . ' but always i have let my horn cry at setting
forth [???] and though thereafter we may walk in the shadows [???] i will not go forth
as a thief in the night . '
[???] the dwarf alone wore openly a short shirt of steel - rings [???] for
[???] make light of burdens ; and in his belt was a broad - bladed axe .
legolas had a bow and a quiver [???] and at his belt a long white knife . the
younger [???] wore the swords that they had taken from the barrow ; but
[???] took only sting ; and his mail - coat [???] as [???] wished [???] remained hidden .
[???] bore his staff [???] but girt at his side was the elven - sword [???] [???]
the mate of [???] that lay now upon the breast of [???] under the lonely
mountain .
all were well furnished by [???] with thick warm clothes [???] and they had
jackets and cloaks lined with fur . spare food and clothes and blankets and
other needs were laden on a pony [???] none other than the poor beast that they
had brought from bree .
? he stay in [???] had worked a great wonder of change on him : he
was glossy and seemed to have the vigour of youth . it was sam who had
insisted on choosing him [???] declaring that bill ( as he called him ) would pine [???]

if he did not come .
` that animal can nearly talk [???] ' he said [???] ` and would talk [???] if he stayed
here much longer . he gave me a look as plain as mr . [???] could speak it :
if you don ' t let me go with you [???] sam [???] i ' ll follow on my own . ' so bill was
going as the beast of burden [???] yet he was the only member of the company that
did not seem depressed .
their farewells had been said in the great hall by the fire [???] and they
were only waiting now for [???] [???] who had not yet come out of the house . a
gleam of firelight came from the open doors [???] and soft lights were glowing in
many windows . [???] [???] in a cloak stood silent on the doorstep beside
[???] . [???] sat with his head bowed to his knees ; only [???] knew fully
what this hour meant to him . the others could be seen as grey shapes in the
darkness .
sam was standing by the pony [???] sucking his teeth [???] and staring moodily
into the gloom where the river roared [???] below ; his desire for
adventure was at its lowest ebb .
` bill [???] my lad [???] ' he said [???] ` you oughtn ' t to have took up with us . you
could have stayed here and et the best hay till the new grass comes . ' bill
swished his tail and said nothing .
sam eased the pack on his shoulders [???] and went over anxiously in his
mind all the things that he had stowed in it [???] wondering if he had forgotten
anything : his chief treasure [???] his cooking gear ; and the little box of salt
that he always carried and refilled when he could ; a good supply of
pipe - weed ( but not near enough [???] i ' ll warrant ) ; flint and tinder ; woollen
hose : linen ; various small belongings of his master ' s that [???] had
forgotten and sam had stowed to bring them out in triumph when they were
called for . he went through them all .
' rope ! ' he muttered . ` no rope ! and only last night you said to
yourself : [???] sam [???] what about a bit of rope ? you ' ll want it [???] if you haven ' t got
it : [???] well [???] i ' ll wa nt it . i can ' t get it now . '
at that moment [???] came out with [???] [???] and he called the company
to him . ' this is my last word [???] ' he said in a low voice . ' the ring - bearer is
setting out on the quest of mount doom . on him alone is any charge laid :
neither to cast away the ring [???] nor to deliver it to any servant of the enemy
nor indeed to let any handle it [???] save members of the company and the
council [???] and only then in gravest need . the others go with him as free
companions [???] to help him on his way . you may tarry [???] or come back [???] or turn

aside into other paths [???] as chance allows . the further you go [???] the less easy
will it be to withdraw ; yet no oath or bond is laid on you to go further
than you will . for you do not yet know the strength of your hearts [???] and you
cannot foresee what each may meet upon the road . '
` faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens [???] ' said [???] .
' maybe [???] ' said [???] [???] ` but let him not vow to walk in the dark [???] who has
not seen the nightfall . '
' yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart [???] ' said [???] .
` or break it [???] ' said [???] . ` look not too far ahead ! but go now with
good hearts ! farewell [???] and may the blessing of elves and men and all free
folk go with you . may the stars shine upon your faces ! '
' good . . . good luck ! ' cried [???] [???] [???] with the cold . ' i don ' t
suppose you will be able to keep a diary [???] [???] my lad [???] but i shall expect a
full account when you get back . and don ' t be too long ! farewell ! '
many other s of [???] ' s household stood in the shadows and watched them
go [???] bidding them farewell with soft voices . there was no laughter [???] and no
song or music . at last they turned away and faded silently into the [???] .
they crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long steep paths that
led out of the cloven vale of [???] ; and they came at length to the high
moor where the wind [???] through the heather . then with one glance at the
last homely house [???] below them they strode away far into the night .
at the ford of [???] they left the road and turning southwards went
on by narrow paths among the folded lands . their purpose was to hold this
course west of the mountains for many miles and days . the country was
much
rougher and mor e barren than in the green vale of the great river in
wilderland on the other side of the range [???] and their going would be slow ;
but they hoped in this way to escape the notice of [???] eyes . the
spies of [???] had hitherto seldom been seen in this empty country [???] and the
paths were little known except to the people of [???] .
[???] walked in front [???] and with him went [???] [???] who knew this land
even in the dark . the others were in file behind [???] and legolas whose eyes
were keen was the [???] . the first part of their journey was hard and
dreary [???] and [???] remembered little of it [???] save the wind . for many sunless
days an icy blast came from the mountains in the east [???] and no garment seemed
able to keep out its searching fingers . though the company was well clad [???]
they seldom felt warm [???] either moving or at rest . they slept [???] during

the middle of the day [???] in some hollow of the land [???] or hidden under the
tangled thorn - bushes that grew in thickets in many places . in the late
afternoon they were roused by the watch [???] and took their chief meal : cold and
cheerless as a rule [???] for they could seldom risk the lighting of a fire . in
the evening they went on again [???] always as nearly southward as they could
find a way .
at first it seemed to the [???] that although they walked and
[???] until they were weary [???] they were creeping forward like snails [???] and
getting nowhere . each day the land looked much the same as it had the day
before . yet steadily the mountains were drawing nearer . south of [???]
they rose ever higher [???] and bent westwards ; and about the feet of the main
range there was tumbled an ever wider land of bleak hills [???] and deep [???]
filled with [???] waters . paths were few and winding [???] and led them often
only to the edge of some sheer fall [???] or down into treacherous swamps .
they had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed . the wind
suddenly fell and then veered round to the south . the swift - flowing clouds
lifted and melted away [???] and the sun came out [???] pale and bright . there came a
cold clear dawn at the end of a long stumbling night - march . the travellers
reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly - trees whose grey - green trunks
seemed to have been bu ilt out of the very stone of the hills . their dark
leaves shone and their berries glowed red in the light of the rising sun .
away in the south [???] could see the dim shapes of lofty mountains
that seemed now to stand across the path that the company was taking . at the
left of this high range rose three peaks ; the tallest and nearest stood up
like a tooth tipped with snow ; its great [???] bare [???] northern [???] was still
largely in the shadow [???] but where the sunlight [???] upon it [???] it glowed
red .
[???] stood at [???] ' s side and looked out under his hand . ` we have
done well [???] ' he said . ` we have reached the borders of the country that men
call hollin ; many elves lived here in happier days [???] when [???] was its
name . five - and - forty leagues as the crow flies we have come [???] though many
long miles further our feet have walked . the land and the weather will be
milder now [???] but perhaps all the more dangerous . '
` dangerous or not [???] a real [???] is mighty welcome [???] ' said [???] [???]
throwing back his hood and letting the morning light fall on his face .
' but the mountains are ahead of us [???] ' said [???] . ` we must have turned
eastwards in the night . '

' no [???] ' said [???] . ' but you see further ahead in the clear light .
beyond those peaks the range bends round south - west . there are many maps
in
[???] ' s house [???] but i suppose you never thought to look at them ? '
` yes i did [???] sometimes [???] ' said [???] [???] ` but i don ' t remember them . [???]
has a better head for that sort of thing . '
` i need no map [???] ' said [???] [???] who had come up with legolas [???] and was
gazing out before him with a strange light in his deep eyes . ` there is the
land where our fathers worked of old [???] and we have wrought the image of those
mountains into many works of metal and of stone [???] and into many songs and
tales . they stand tall in our dreams : baraz [???] [???] [???] [???] .
` only once before have i seen them from afar in waking life [???] but i know
them and their names [???] for under them lies [???] - dym [???] the [???] [???] that
is now called the black pit [???] moria in the elvish tongue . yonder stands
[???] [???] the [???] [???] cruel [???] ; and beyond him are [???] and
cloudyhead : [???] the white [???] and [???] the grey [???] that we call
[???] - [???] and [???] .
` there the misty mountains divide [???] and between their arms lies the
deep - shadowed valley which we cannot forget : [???] [???] the [???] dale [???]
which the elves call [???] . '
` it is for the [???] dale that we are making [???] ' said [???] . ` if we
climb the pass that is called the [???] gate [???] under the far side of
[???] [???] we shall come down by the [???] stair into the deep vale of the
[???] . there lies the [???] [???] and there the river [???] rises in
its icy springs . '
` dark is the water of [???] - [???] [???] ' said [???] [???] ` and cold are the
springs of [???] - [???] . my heart trembles at the thought that i may see them
soon . '
` may you have joy of the sight [???] my good dwarf l ' said [???] . ' but
whatever you may do [???] we at least cannot stay in that valley . we must go down
the [???] into the secret woods [???] and so to the great river [???] and then
- - '
he paused .
' yes [???] and where then ? ' asked merry .
' to the end of the journey - - in the end [???] ' said [???] . ' we cannot
look too far ahead . let us be glad that the first stage is safely over . i
think we will rest here [???] not only today but tonight as well . there is a

wholesome air about hollin . much evil must befall a country before it wholly
forgets the elves [???] if once they dwelt there . '
' that is true [???] ' said legolas . ` but the elves of this land were of a
race strange to us of the silvan folk [???] and the trees and the grass do not
now remember them : only i hear the stones lament them : deep they delved us [???]
fair they wrought us [???] high they builded us ; but they are gone . they are
gone . they sought the havens long ago . '
that morning they lit a fire in a deep hollow shrouded by great bushes
of holly [???] and their supper - breakfast was merrier than it had been since they
set out . they did not hurry to bed afterwards [???] for they expected to have all
the night to sleep in [???] and they did not mean to go on again until the
evening of the next day . only [???] was silent and restless . after a while
he left the company and wandered on to the ridge ; there he stood in the
shadow of a tree [???] looking out southwards and westwards [???] with his head posed
as if he was listening . then he returned to the brink of the dell and look ed
down at the others laughing and talking .
` what is the matter [???] strider ? ' merry called up . ' what are you looking
for ? do you miss the east wind ? '
' no indeed [???] ' he answered . ` but i miss something . i have been in the
country of hollin in many seasons . no folk dwell here now [???] but many other
creatures live here at all times [???] especially birds . yet now all things but
you are silent . i can feel it . there is no sound for miles about us [???] and
your voices seem to make the ground echo . i do not understand it . '
[???] looked up with sudden interest . ` but what do you guess is the
reason ? ' he asked . ` is there more in it than surprise at seeing four
[???] [???] not to mention the rest of us [???] where people are so seldom seen or
heard ? '
` i hope that is it [???] ' answered [???] . ` but i have a sense of
watchfulness [???] and of fear [???] that i have never had here before . '
[???] then we must be more careful [???] ' said [???] . ' if you bring a ranger
with you [???] it is well to pay attention to him [???] especially if the ranger is
[???] . we must stop talking aloud [???] rest quietly [???] and set the watch . '
it was sam ' s turn that day to take the first watch [???] but [???] joined
him . the others fell asleep . then the silence grew until even sam felt it .
the breathing of the sleepers could be plainly heard . the swish of the
pony ' s tail and the occasional movements of his feet became loud noises . sam
could hear his own joints creaking [???] if he stirred . dead silence was around

him [???] and over all hung a clear blue sky [???] as the sun rode up from the east .
away in the south a dark patch appeared [???] and grew [???] and drove north like
flying smoke in the wind .
` what ' s that [???] strider ? it don ' t look like a cloud [???] ' said sam in a
whisper to [???] . he made no answer [???] he was gazing intently at the sky ;
but before long sam could see for himself what was approaching . flocks of
birds [???] flying at great speed [???] were wheeling and circling [???] and [???] all
the land as if they were searching for something ; and they were steadily
drawing nearer .
` lie flat and still ! ' [???] [???] [???] pulling sam down into the shade
of a holly - bush ; for a whole regiment of birds had broken away suddenly from
the main host [???] and came [???] flying low [???] straight towards the ridge . sam thought
they were a kind of crow of large size . as they passed overhead [???] in so dense
a throng that their shadow followed them darkly over the ground below [???] one
harsh croak was heard .
not until they had [???] into the distance [???] north and west [???] and the
sky was again clear would [???] rise . then he sprang up and went and
wakened [???] .
` regiments of black crows are flying over all the land between the
mountains and the [???] [???] ' he said [???] ` and they have passed over hollin .
they are not natives here ; they are crebain out of fangorn and dunland . i do
not know what they are about : possibly there is some trouble away south from
which they are [???] ; but i think they are spying out the land . i have
also [???] many hawks flying high up in the sky . i think we ought to move
again this evening . hollin is no longer wholesome for us : it is being
watched . '
` and in that case so is the [???] gate [???] ' said [???] ; ` and how we
can get over that withou t being seen [???] i cannot imagine . but we will think of
that when we must . as for moving as soon as it is dark [???] i am afraid that you
are right . '
` luckily our fire made little smoke [???] and had burned low before the
crebain came [???] ' said [???] . ` it must be put out and not lit again . '
` well if that isn ' t a plague and a [???] ! ' said [???] . the news : no
fire [???] and a move again by night [???] had been broken to him [???] as soon as he woke
in the late afternoon . ' all because of a pack of crows ! i had looked forward
to a real good meal tonight : something hot . '
` well [???] you can go on looking forward [???] ' said [???] . ` there may be many

unexpected feasts ahead for you . for myself i should like a pipe to smoke in
comfort [???] and warmer feet . however [???] we are certain of one thing at any rate :
it will get warmer as we get south . '
' too warm [???] i shouldn ' t wonder [???] ' muttered sam to [???] . ' but i ' m
beginning to think it ' s time we got a sight of that fiery mountain and saw
the end of the road [???] so to speak . i thought at first that this here [???] [???]
or whatever its name is [???] might be it [???] till [???] spoke his piece . a fair
jaw - cracker dwarf - language must be ! ' maps conveyed nothing to sam ' s mind [???]
and all distances in these strange lands seemed so vast that he was quite
out of his reckoning .
all that day the company remained in hiding . the dark birds passed over
now and again ; but as the westering sun grew red they disappeared
southwards . at [???] the company set out [???] and turning now half east they
steered their course towards [???] [???] which far away still glowed faintly
red in the last light of the vanished sun . one by one white stars sprang
forth as the sky faded .
guided by [???] they struck a good path . it looked to [???] like the
remains of an ancient road [???] that had once been broad and well planned [???] from
hollin to the mountain - pass . the moon [???] now at the full [???] rose over the
mountains [???] and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were black .
many of them looked to have been worked by hands [???] though now they lay
tumbled and ruinous in a bleak [???] barren land .
it was the cold chill hour before the first stir of dawn [???] and the moon
was low . [???] looked up at the sky . suddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass
over the high stars [???] as if for a moment they faded and then flashed out
again . he shivered .
` did you see anything pass over ? ' he whispered to [???] [???] who was just
ahead .
` no [???] but i felt it [???] whatever it was [???] ' he answered . ` it may be nothing [???]
only a wisp of thin cloud . '
` it was moving fast then [???] ' muttered [???] [???] ` and not with the wind . '
nothing further happened that night . the next morning [???] even
brighter than before . but the air was chill again ; already the wind was
turning back towards the east . for two more nights they marched on [???] climbing
steadily but ever more slowly as their road wound up into the hills [???] and the
mountains towered up [???] nearer and nearer . on the third morning [???] rose
before them [???] a mighty peak [???] tipped with snow like silver [???] but with sheer

naked sides [???] dull red as if stained with blood .
there was a black look in the sky [???] and the sun was wan . the wind had
gone now round to the north - east . [???] snuffed the air and looked ba ck .
` winter deepens behind us [???] ' he said quietly to [???] . ' the heights
away north are whiter than they were ; snow is lying far down their
shoulders . tonight we shall be on our way high up towards the [???] gate .
we may well be seen by watchers on that narrow path [???] and [???] by some
evil ; but the weather may prove a more deadly enemy than any . what do you
think of your course now [???] [???] ? '
[???] overheard these words [???] and understood that [???] and [???]
were continuing some debate that had begun long before . he listened
anxiously .
' i think no good of our course from beginning to end [???] as you know well [???]
[???] [???] ' answered [???] . ` and perils known and unknown will grow as we
go
on . but we must go on ; and it is no good our delaying the passage of the
mountains . further south there are no passes [???] till one comes to the gap of
[???] . i do not trust that way since your news of [???] . who knows
which
side now the marshals of the horse - lords serve ? '
' who knows indeed ! ' said [???] . ` but there is another way [???] and not by
the pass of [???] : the dark and secret way that we have spoken of . '
' but let us not speak of it again ! not yet . say nothing to the others i
beg [???] not until it is plain tha t there is no other way . '
' we must decide before we go further [???] ' answered [???] .
' then let us weigh the matter in our minds [???] while the others rest and
sleep [???] ' said [???] .
in the late afternoon [???] while the others were finishing their breakfast [???]
[???] and [???] went aside together and stood looking at [???] . its
sides were now dark and sullen [???] and its head was in grey cloud . [???]
watched them [???] wondering which way the debate would go . when they returned
to
the company ganda lf spoke [???] and then he knew that it had been decided to face
the weather and the high pass . he was relieved . he could not guess what was
the other dark and secret way [???] but the very mention of it had seemed to fill
[???] with dismay [???] and [???] was glad that it had been abandoned .
` from signs that we have seen lately [???] ' said [???] [???] ' i fear that the

[???] gate may be watched ; and also i have doubts of the weather that is
coming up behind . snow may come . we must go with all the speed that we
can .
even so it will take us more than two marches before we reach the top of the
pass . dark will come early this evening . we must leave as soon as you can
get ready . '
' i will add a word of advice [???] if i may [???] ' said [???] . ' i was born
under the shadow of the white mountains and know something of journeys
in
the high places . we shall meet bitter cold [???] if no worse [???] before we come down
on the other side . it will not help us to keep so secret that we are frozen
to death . when we leave here [???] where there are still a few trees and bushes [???]
each of us should carry a [???] of wood [???] as large as he can bear . '
' and bill could take a bit more [???] couldn ' t you lad ? ' said sam . the pony
looked at him mournfully .
' very well [???] ' said [???] . ` but we must not use the wood - - not unless
it is a choice between fire and death . '
the company set out again with good speed at first ; but soon their way
became steep and difficult . the twisting and climbing road had in many
places almost disappeared [???] and was blocked with many fallen stones . the
night grew deadly dark under great clouds . a bitter wind [???] among the
rocks . by midnight they had climbed to the knees of the great mountains . the
narrow path now wound under a sheer wall of cliffs to the left [???] above which
the grim flanks of [???] towered up invisible in the gloom ; on the right
was a gulf of darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravine .
[???] they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a moment at the
top . [???] felt a soft touch on his face . he put out his arm and saw the dim
white flakes of snow settling on his sleeve .
they went on . but before long the snow was falling fast [???] filling all
the air [???] and [???] into [???] ' s eyes . the dark bent shapes of [???] and
[???] only a pace or two ahead could hardly be seen .
' i don ' t like this at all [???] ' panted sam just behind . ' snow ' s all right
on a fine morning [???] but i like to be in bed while it ' s falling . i wish this
lot would go off to [???] ! folk might welcome it there . ' except on the
high moors of the [???] a heavy fall was rare in the shire [???] and was
regarded as a pleasant event and a chance for fun . no living hobbit ( save

[???] ) could remember the fell winter of [???] [???] when the white wolves
invaded
the shire over the frozen [???] .
[???] halted . snow was thick on his hood and shoulders ; it was
already ankle - deep about his boots .
[???] this is what i feared [???] ' he said . ` what do you say now [???] [???] ? '
' that i feared it too [???] ' [???] answered [???] ` but less than other things .
i knew the risk of snow [???] though it seldom falls heavily so far south [???] save
high up in the mountains . but we are not high yet ; we are still far down [???]
where the paths are usually open all the winter . '
' i wonder if this is a [???] of the enemy [???] ' said [???] . [???] they
say in my land that he can govern the storms in the mountains of shadow that
stand upon the borders of [???] . he has strange powers and many allies . '
' his arm has grown long indeed [???] ' said [???] [???] ` if he can draw snow down
from the north to trouble us here three hundred leagues away . '
' his arm has grown long [???] ' said [???] .
while they were halted [???] the wind died down [???] and the snow slackened
until it almost ceased . they tramped on again . but they had not gone more
than a furlong when the storm returned with fresh fury . the wind whistled
and the snow became a blinding [???] . soon even [???] found it hard to
keep going . the [???] [???] bent nearly double [???] toiled along behind the taller
folk [???] but it was plain that they could not go much further [???] if the snow
continued . [???] ' s feet felt like lead . [???] was dragging behind . even
[???] [???] as stout as any dwarf could be [???] was grumbling as he [???] .
the company halted suddenly [???] as if they had come to an agreement
without any words being spoken . they heard eerie noises in the darkness
round them . it may have been only a trick of the wind in the cracks and
gullies of the rocky wall [???] but the sounds were those of shrill cries [???] and
wild howls of laughter . stones began to fall from the mountain - side [???]
whistling over their heads [???] or [???] on the path beside them . every now
and again they heard a dull rumble [???] as a gr eat [???] rolled down from
hidden heights above .
` we cannot go further tonight [???] ' said [???] . ` let those call it the
wind who will ; there are fell voices on the air ; and these stones are aimed
at us . '
` i do call it the wind [???] ' said [???] n . ` but that does not make what you
say untrue . there are many evil and [???] things in the world that have

little love for those that go on two legs [???] and yet are not in league with
[???] [???] but have purposes of their own . some have been in this world longer
than he . '
' [???] was called the cruel [???] and had an ill name [???] said [???] [???] ` long
years ago [???] when rumour of [???] had not been heard in these lands . '
` it matters little who is the enemy [???] if we cannot beat off his attack ;
said [???] .
' but what can we do ? ' cried [???] miserably . he was leaning on merry
and [???] [???] and he was shivering .
` either stop where we are [???] or go back [???] ' said [???] . ' it is no good
going on . only a little higher [???] if i remember rightly [???] this path leaves the
cliff and runs into a wide shallow trough at the bottom of a long hard
slope . we should have no shelter there from snow [???] or stones - - or anything
else . '
` and it is no good going back while the storm holds [???] ' said [???] . ` we
have pa [???] no place on the way up that offered more shelter than this
cliff - wall we are under now . '
` shelter ! ' muttered sam . ` if this is shelter [???] then one wall and no roof
make a house . '
the company now gathered together as close to the cliff as they could .
it faced southwards [???] and near the bottom it leaned out a little [???] so that
they hoped it would give them some protection from the [???] wind and
from the falling stones . but [???] blasts [???] round them from every
side [???] and the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds .
they [???] together with their backs to the wall . bill the pony stood
patiently but dejectedly in front of the [???] [???] and screened them a
little ; but before long the drifting snow was above his hocks [???] and it went
on mounting . if they had had no larger companions the [???] would soon
have been entirely buried .
a great sleepiness came over [???] ; he felt himself sinking fast into a
warm and hazy dream . he thought a fire was heating his toes [???] and out of the
shadows on the other side of the hearth he heard [???] ' s voice speaking . i
don ' t think much of your diary [???] he said . [???] on [???] the [???] :
there was no need to come back to report that !
but i wanted rest and sleep [???] [???] [???] [???] answered with an effort [???] when
he felt himself shaken [???] and he came back painfully to wakefulness . [???]
had lifted him off the ground out of a nest of snow .

` this will be the death of the halflings [???] [???] [???] ' said [???] . ` it
is useless to sit here until the snow goes over our heads . we must do
something to save ourselves . '
` give them this [???] ' said [???] [???] searching in his pack and drawing out a
leathern flask . ` just a mouthful each - - for all of us . it is very precious .
it is [???] [???] the cordial of [???] . [???] gave it to me at our parting .
pass it round ! '
as soon as [???] had swallowed a little of the warm and fragrant liquor
he felt a new strength of heart [???] and the heavy drowsiness left his limbs .
the others a lso revived and found fresh hope and vigour . but the snow did
not relent . it whirled about them thicker than ever [???] and the wind blew
louder .
' what do you say to fire ? ' asked [???] suddenly . ' the choice seems
near now between fire and death [???] [???] . doubtless we shall be hidden from
all [???] eyes when the snow has covered us [???] but that will not help
us . '
' you may make a fire [???] if you can [???] ' answered [???] . ' if there are any
watchers that can endure this storm [???] then they can see us [???] fire or no . ' but
though they had brought wood and kindlings by the advice of [???] [???] it
passed the skill of elf or even dwarf to strike a flame that would hold amid
the [???] wind or catch in the wet fuel . at last [???] [???]
himself took a hand . picking up a [???] he held it aloft for a moment [???] and
then with a word of command [???] [???] an [???] ammen ! he thrust the end of his
staff into the midst of it . at once a great spout of green and blue flame
sprang out [???] and the wood flared and [???] .
` if there are any to see [???] then i at least am revealed to them [???] ' he
said . ' i have written [???] is here in signs that all can read from
[???] to the mouths of [???] . '
but the company cared no longer for watchers or [???] eyes . their
hearts were rejoiced to see the light of the fire . the wood burned merrily ;
and though all round it the snow [???] [???] and [???] of slush crept under
their feet [???] they warmed their hands gladly at the blaze . there they stood [???]
stooping in a circle round the little dancing and blowing flames . a red
light was on their tired and anxious faces ; behind them the night was like a
black wall .
but the wood was burning fast [???] and the snow still fell .
the fire burned low . and the last [???] was thrown on .

the night is getting old [???] ' said [???] . [???] the dawn is not far off . '
` if any dawn can pierce these clouds [???] ' said [???] .
[???] stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackness .
' the snow is growing less [???] ' he said [???] ` and the wind is quieter . '
[???] gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out of the dark to be
revealed white for a moment in the light of the dying fire ; but for a long
time he could see no sign of their slackening . then suddenly [???] as sleep was
beginning to creep over him again [???] he was aware that the wind had indeed
fallen [???] and the flakes were becoming larger and fewer . very slowly a dim
light began to grow . at last the snow stopped altogether .
as the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world . below
their [???] were white humps and domes and shapeless deeps beneath which
the path that they had trodden was altogether lost ; but the heights above
were hidden in great clouds still heavy with the threat of snow .
[???] looked up and shook his head . ` [???] has not forgiven us . ' he
said . ` he has more snow yet to fling at us [???] if we go on . the sooner we go
back and down the better . '
to this all agreed [???] but their retreat was now difficult . it might well
prove impossible . only a few paces from the ashes of their fire the snow lay
many feet deep [???] higher than the heads of the [???] ; in places it had been
[???] and piled by the wind into great drifts against the cliff .
` if [???] would go before us with a bright flame [???] he might melt a
path for you [???] ' said legolas . the storm had troubled him little [???] and he alone
of the company remained still light of heart .
` if elves could fly over mountains [???] they might fetch the sun to save
us [???] ' answered [???] . ` but i must have something to work on . i cannot burn
snow . '
` well [???] ' said [???] [???] ` when heads are at a loss bodies must serve [???] as
we say in my country . the strongest of us must seek a way . see ! though all
is now snow - clad [???] our path [???] as we came up [???] turned about that shoulder of
rock down yonder . it was there that the snow first began to burden us . if we
could reach that point [???] maybe it would prove easier beyond . it is no more
than a furlong off [???] i guess . '
` then let us force a path thither [???] you and i ! ' said [???] .
[???] was the tallest of the company [???] but [???] [???] little less in
height [???] was broader and heavier in build . he led the way [???] and [???]
followed him . slowly they moved off [???] and were soon toiling heavily . in

places the snow was breast - high [???] and often [???] seemed to bc swimming
or
[???] with his great arms rather than walking .
legolas watched them for a while with a smile upon his lips [???] and then
he turned to the others . ` the strongest must seek a way [???] say you ? but i say :
let a ploughman plough [???] but choose an [???] for swimming [???] and for running
light over grass and leaf or over snow - an elf . '
with that he sprang forth nimbly [???] and then [???] noticed as if for the
first time [???] though he had long known it [???] that the elf had no boots [???] but wore
only light shoes [???] as he always did [???] and his feet made little imprint in the
snow .
' farewell ! ' he said to [???] . ` i go to find the sun ! ' then swift as a
runner over firm sand he shot away [???] and quickly overtaking the toiling men [???]
with a wave of his hand he passed them [???] and sped into the distance [???] and
vanished round the rocky turn .
the others waited [???] together [???] watching until [???] and [???] n
[???] into black specks in the whiteness . at length they too passed from
sight . the time dragged on . the clouds lowered [???] and now a few flakes of snow
came curling down again .
an hour [???] maybe [???] went by [???] though it seemed far longer [???] and then at last
they saw legolas coming back . at the same time [???] and [???]
reappeared round the bend far behind him and came labouring up the slope .
` well [???] ' cried legolas as he ran up [???] ` i have not brought the sun . she is
walking in the blue fields of the south [???] and a little wreath of snow on this
[???] hillock troubles her not at all . but i have brought back a gleam of
good hope for those who are doomed to go on feet . there is the greatest
wind - drift of all just beyond the turn [???] and there our strong men were almost
buried . they despaired [???] until i returned and told them that the drift was
little wider than a wall . and on the other side the snow suddenly grows
less [???] while further down it is no more than a white coverlet to cool a
hobbit ' s toes . '
` ah [???] it is as i said [???] ' growled [???] . ' it was no ordinary storm . it is
the ill will of [???] . he does not love elves and [???] [???] and that
drift was laid to cut off our escape . '
' but happily your [???] has forgotten that you have men with you [???] '
said [???] [???] who came up at that moment . ` and [???] men too [???] if i may
say

it ; though lesser men with spades might have served you better . still [???] we
have thrust a lane through the drift ; and for that all here may be grateful
who cannot run as light as elves . '
` but how are we to get down there [???] even if you have cut through the
drift ? ' said [???] [???] voicing the thought of all the [???] .
' have hope ! ' said [???] . ' i am weary [???] but i still have some strength
left [???] and [???] too . we will bear the little folk . the others no doubt
will make shift to tread the path behind us . come [???] master [???] ! i will
begin with you . '
he lifted up the hobbit . ' cling to my back ! i shall need my arms ' he
said and strode forward . [???] with merry came behind . [???] marvelled at
his strength [???] seeing the passage that he had already forced with no other
tool than his great limbs . even now [???] burdened as he was [???] he was widening the
track for those who followed [???] thrusting the snow aside as he went .
they came at length to the great drift . it was flung across the
mountain - path like a sheer and sudden wall [???] and its crest [???] sharp as if
shaped with knives [???] reared up more than twice the height of [???] ; but
through the middle a passage had been beaten [???] rising and falling like a
bridge . on the far side merry and [???] were set down [???] and there they
waited with legolas for the rest of the company to arrive .
after a while [???] returned carrying sam . behind in the narrow but
now well - trodden track came [???] [???] leading bill with [???] perched among
the [???] . last came [???] carrying [???] . they passed through the lane ;
but hardly had [???] touched the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled
down a fall of stones and [???] snow . the spray of it half blinded the
company as they [???] against the cliff [???] and when the air cleared again
they saw that the path was blocked behind them .
` enough [???] enough ! ' cried [???] . ' we are departing as quickly as we may ! '
and indeed with that last stroke the malice of the mountain seemed to be
expended [???] as if [???] was satisfied that the [???] had been beaten
off and would not dare to return . the threat of snow lift ed ; the clouds
began to break and the light grew broader .
as legolas had reported [???] they found that the snow became steadily more
shallow as they went down [???] so that even the [???] could trudge along . soon
they all stood once more on the flat shelf at the head of the steep slope
where they had felt the first flakes of snow the night before .
the morning was now far advanced . from the high place they looked back

westwards over the lower lands . far away in the tumble of country that lay
at the foot of the mountain was the dell from which they had started to
climb the pass .
[???] ' s legs ached . he was chilled to the bone and hungry ; and his head
was [???] as he thought of the long and painful march [???] . black specks
swam before his eyes . he rubbed them [???] but the black specks remained . in the
distance below him [???] but still high above the lower [???] [???] dark dots were
circling in the air .
` the birds again ! ' said [???] [???] pointing down .
' that cannot be helped now [???] ' said [???] . ` whether they are good or
evil [???] or have nothing to do with us at all [???] we must go down at once . not
even on the knees of [???] will we wait for another night - fall ! '
a cold wind flowed down behind them [???] as they turned their backs on the
[???] gate [???] and [???] wearily down the slope . [???] had defeated
them .




chapter 4 . a journey in the dark



it was evening [???] and the grey light was again waning fast [???] when they
halted for the night . they were very weary . the mountains were veiled in
deepening [???] [???] and the wind was cold . [???] spared them one more
mouthful
each of the [???] of [???] . when they had eaten some food he called a
council .
' we cannot [???] of course [???] go on again tonight [???] ' he said . ` the attack on
the [???] gate has tired us out [???] and we must rest here for a while . '
` and then where are we to go ? ' asked [???] .
' we still have our journey and our errand before us [???] ' answered [???] .
` we have no choice but to go on [???] or to return to [???] . '
[???] ' s face brightened visibly at the mere mention of return to
[???] ; merry and sam looked up hopefully . but [???] and [???]
made
no sign . [???] looked troubled .
` i wish i was back there [???] ' he said . ` but how can i return without shame
- - unless there is indeed no other way [???] and we are already defeated ? '
` you are right [???] [???] [???] ' said [???] : ` to go back is to admit defeat
and face worse defeat to come . if we go back now [???] then the ring must remain
there : we shall not be able to set out again . then sooner or later [???]
will be [???] [???] and after a brief and bitter time it will be destroyed .
the [???] are deadly enemies [???] but they are only shadows yet of the
power and terror they would possess if the ruling ring was on their master ' s
hand again . '
' then we must go on [???] if there is a way [???] ' said [???] with a sigh . sam
sank back into gloom .
` there is a way that we may attempt [???] ' said [???] . ` i thought from the
beginning [???] when first i considered this journey [???] that we should try it . but
it is not a pleasant way [???] and i have not spoken of it to the company before .
[???] was against it [???] until the pass over the mountains had at least been
tried . '
` if it is a worse road than the [???] gate [???] then it must be evil

indeed [???] ' said merry . ` but you had better tell us about it [???] and let us know
the worst at once . '
' the road that i speak of leads to the mines of moria [???] ' said [???] .
only [???] lifted up his head ; a [???] fire was in his eyes . on all
the others a dread fell at the mention of that name . even to the [???] it
was a legend of vague fear :
` the road may lead to moria [???] but how can we hope that it will lead
through moria ? ' said [???] darkly .
` it is a name of ill omen [???] ' said [???] . ` nor do i see the need to go
there . if we cannot cross the mountains [???] let us journey southwards [???] until we
come to the gap of [???] [???] where men are friendly to my people [???] taking the
road that i followed on my way hither . or we might pass by and cross the
isen into [???] and [???] [???] and so come to [???] from the regions
nigh to the sea . '
' things have changed since you came north [???] [???] [???] ' answered [???] .
' did you not hear what i told you of [???] ? with him i may have business
of my own ere all is over . but the ring must not come near [???] [???] if that
can by any means be prevented . the gap of [???] is closed to us while we go
with the bearer .
' as for the longer road : we cannot afford the time . we might spend a
year in such a journey [???] and we should pass through many lands that are empty
and harbourless . yet they would not be safe . the watchful eyes both of
[???] and of the enemy are on them . when you came north [???] [???] [???] you
were
in the enemy ' s eyes only one stray wanderer from the south and a matter of
small concern to him : his mind was busy with the pursuit of the ring . but
you return now as a member of the ring ' s company [???] and you are in peril as
long as you remain with us . the danger will increase with every league that
we go south under the naked sky .
` since our open attempt on the mountain - pass our plight has become more
desperate [???] i fear . i see now little hope [???] if we do not soon vanish from
sight for a while [???] and cover our trail . therefore i advise that we should go
neither over the mountains [???] nor round them [???] but under them . that is a road
at any rate that the enemy will least expect us to take . '
` we do not know what he expects [???] ' said [???] . ` he may watch all
roads [???] likely and unlikely . in that case to enter moria would be to walk
into a trap [???] hardly better than knocking at the gates of the dark tower

itself . the name of moria is black . '
` you speak of what you do not know [???] when you liken moria to the
stronghold of [???] [???] ' answered [???] . ` i alone of you have ever been in
the dungeons of the dark lord [???] and only in his older and lesser dwelling in
dol [???] . those who pass the gates of barad - dyr do not return . but i wou ld
not lead you into moria if there were no hope of coming out again . if there
are [???] there [???] it may prove ill for us [???] that is true . but most of the [???]
of the misty mountains were scattered or destroyed in the battle of five
armies . the eagles report that [???] are gathering again from afar ; but there
is a hope that moria is still free .
` there is even a chance that [???] are there [???] and that in some deep
hall of his fathers [???] balin son of [???] may be found . however it may prove [???]
one must tread the path that need chooses ! '
' i will tread the path with you [???] [???] ! ' said [???] . ' i will go and
look on the halls of durin [???] whatever may wait there - if you can find the
doors that are shut . '
' good [???] [???] ! ' said [???] . ` you encourage me . we will seek the
hidden doors together . and we will come through . in the ruins of the
[???] [???] a dwarf ' s head will be less easy to [???] than elves or men or
[???] . yet it will not be the first time that i have been to moria . i
sought there long for [???] son of thrur after he was lost . i passed
through [???] and i came out again alive ! '
` i too once passed the [???] gate [???] ' said [???] quietly ; ' but though
i also came out again [???] the memory is very evil . i do not wish to enter moria
a second time . '
' and i don ' t wish to enter it even once [???] ' said [???] .
' nor me [???] ' muttered sam .
` of course not ! ' said [???] . ' who would ? but the question is : who
will follow me [???] if i lead you there ? '
' i will [???] ' said [???] eagerly .
' i will [???] ' said [???] heavily . ` you followed my lead almost to
disaster in the snow [???] and have said no word of blame . i will follow your
lead now - - if this last warning does not move you . it is not of the ring [???]
nor of us others that i am thinking now [???] but of you [???] [???] . and i say to
you : if you pass the doors of moria [???] beware ! '
` i will not go [???] ' said [???] ; ' not unless the vote of the whole
company is against me . what do legolas and the little folk say ? the

ring - bearer ' s voice surely should be heard ? '
' i do not wish to go to moria [???] ' said legolas .
the [???] said nothing . sam looked at [???] . at last [???] spoke . ` i
do not wish to go [???] ' he said ; ` but neither do i wish to refuse the advice of
[???] . i beg that there should be no vote [???] until we have slept on it .
[???] will get votes easier in the light of the morning than in this cold
gloom . how the wind howls ! '
at these words all fell into silent thought . they heard the wind
hissing among the rocks and trees [???] and there was a howling and wailing round
them in the empty spaces of the night .
suddenly [???] leapt to his feet . ' how the wind howls ! ' he cried .
' it is howling with wolf - voices . the wargs have come west of the mountains !
'
' need we wait until morning then ? ' said [???] . ` it is as i said . the
hunt is up ! even if we live to see the dawn [???] who now will wish to journey
south by night with the wild wolves on his trail ? '
' how far is moria ? ' asked [???] .
` there was a door south - west of [???] [???] some fifteen miles as the
crow flies [???] and maybe twenty as the wolf runs [???] ' answered [???] grimly .
' then let us start as soon as it is light tomorrow [???] if we can [???] ' said
[???] . ' the wolf that one hears is worse than the orc that one fears . '
` true ! ' said [???] [???] loosening his sword in its sheath . ` but where the
warg howls [???] there also the orc [???] . '
` i wish i had taken [???] ' s advice [???] ' muttered [???] to sam . ` i am no
good after all . there is not enough of the breed of [???] the [???]
in me : these howls freeze my blood . i don ' t ever remember feeling so
wretched . '
' my heart ' s right down in my toes [???] mr . [???] [???] ' said sam . ' but we
aren ' t etten yet [???] and there are some stout folk here with us . whatever may
be in store for old [???] [???] i ' ll wager it isn ' t a wolf ' s belly . '
for their defence in the night the company climbed to the top of the
small hill under which they had been sheltering . it was crowned with a knot
of old and twisted trees [???] about which lay a broken circle of [???] stones .
in the midst of this they lit a fire [???] for there was no hope that darkness
and silence would keep their trail from discovery by the hunting packs .
round the fire they sat [???] and those that were not on guard dozed
[???] . poor bill the pony trembled and sweated where he stood . the

howling of the wolves was now all round them [???] sometimes nearer and
sometimes
further off . in the dead of the night many shining eyes were seen peering
over the brow of the hill . some advanced almost to the ring of stones . at a
gap in the circle a great dark wolf - shape could be seen halted [???] gazing at
them . a [???] howl broke from him [???] as if he were a captain summoning
his pack to the assault .
[???] stood up and strode forward [???] holding his staff aloft . ' listen [???]
hound of [???] ! ' he cried . ` [???] is here . fly [???] if you value your foul
skin ! i will shrivel you from tail to snout [???] if you come within this ring . '
the wolf [???] and sprang towards them with a great leap . at that
moment there was a sharp twang . legolas had loosed his bow . there was a
hideous yell [???] and the leaping shape [???] to the ground ; the elvish arrow
had pierced its throat . the watching eyes were suddenly [???] .
[???] and [???] strode forward [???] but the hill was deserted ; the hunting
packs had fled . all about them the darkness grew silent [???] and no cry came on
the sighing wind .
the night was old [???] and westward the waning moon was setting . gleaming
fitfully through the breaking clouds . suddenly [???] started from sleep .
without warning a storm of howls broke out fierce and wild all about the
camp . a great host of wargs ha d gathered silently and was now attacking them
from every side at once .
` fling fuel on the fire ! ' cried [???] to the [???] . ` draw your
blades [???] and stand back to back ! '
in the leaping light [???] as the fresh wood blazed up [???] [???] saw many gr ey
shapes spring over the ring of stones . more and more followed . through the
throat of one huge leader [???] passed his sword with a thrust ; with a
great sweep [???] hewed the head off another . beside them [???] stood
with
his stout legs apart [???] [???] his dwarf - axe . the bow of legolas was
singing .
in the wavering firelight [???] seemed suddenly to grow : he rose up [???]
a great [???] shape like the monument of some ancient king of stone set
upon a hill . stooping like a cloud [???] he lifted a burning branch and strode to
meet the wolves . they gave back before him . high in the air he tossed the
blazing brand . it flared with a sudden white radiance like lightning ; and
his voice rolled like thunder .

` [???] an [???] ammen ! [???] dan i [???] ! ' he cried .
there was a roar and a crackle [???] and the tree above him burst into a
leaf and bloom of blinding flame . the fire leapt from tree - top to tree - top .
the whole hill was crowned with [???] light . the swords and knives of the
defenders shone and [???] . the last arrow of legolas kindled in the air
as it flew [???] and [???] burning into the heart of a great wolf - chieftain .
all the others fled .
slowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling ash and sparks ;
a bitter smoke curled above the burned tree - stumps [???] and blew darkly from the
hill [???] as the first light of dawn came dimly in the sky . their enemies were
routed and did not return .
` what did i tell you [???] mr . [???] ? ' said sam [???] she [???] thing his sword .
` wolves won ' t get him . that was an eye - opener [???] and no mistake ! nearly singed
the hair off my head ! '
when the full light of the morning came no signs of the wolves were to
be found [???] and they looked in vain for the bodies of the dead . no trace of
the fight remained but the charred trees and the arrows of legolas lying on
the hill - top . all were [???] save one of which only the point was left .
` it is as i feared [???] ' said [???] . ` these were no ordinary wolves
hunting for food in the wilderness . let us eat quickly and go ! '
that day the weather changed again [???] almost as if it was at the command
of some power that had no longer any use for snow [???] since they had retreated
from the pass [???] a power that wished now to have a clear light in which things
that moved in the wild could be seen from far away . the wind had been
turning through north to north - west during the night [???] and now it failed . the
clouds vanished southwards and the sky was opened [???] high and blue . as they
stood upon the hill - side [???] ready to depart [???] a pale sunlight gleamed over the
mountain - tops .
` we must reach the doors before sunset [???] ' said [???] [???] ' or i fear we
shall not reach them at all . it is not far [???] but our path may be winding [???] for
here [???] cannot guide us ; he has seldom walked in this country [???] and only
once have i been under the west wall of moria [???] and that was long ago .
` there it lies [???] ' he said [???] pointing away south - eastwards to where the
mountains ' sides fell sheer into the shadows at their feet . in the distance
could be dimly seen a line of bare cliffs [???] and in their midst [???] taller than
the rest [???] one great grey wall . ` when we left the pass i led you southwards [???]
and not back to our starting point [???] as some of you may have noticed . it is

well that i did so [???] for now we have several miles less to cross [???] and haste
is needed . let us go ! '
` i do not know which to hope [???] ' said [???] grimly : ` that [???] will
find what he seeks [???] or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost
for ever . all choices seem ill [???] and to be caught between wolves and the wall
the likeliest chance . lead on ! '
[???] now walked ahead by the [???] ' s side [???] so eager was he to come to
moria . together they led the company back towards the mountains . the only
road of old to moria from the west had lain along the course of a stream [???]
the [???] [???] that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near where the doors
had stood . but either [???] was [???] [???] or else the land had changed in
recent years ; for he did not strike the stream where he looked to find it [???]
only a few miles southwards from their start .
the morning was passing towards noon [???] and still the company wandered
and [???] in a barren country of red stones . nowhere could they see any
gleam of water or hear any sound of it . all was bleak and dry . their hearts
sank . they saw no living thing [???] and not a bird was in the sky ; but what the
night would bring [???] if it caught them in that lost land [???] none of them cared
to think .
suddenly [???] [???] who had pressed on ahead [???] called back to them . he was
standing on a knoll and pointing to the right . hurrying up they saw below
them a deep and narrow channel . it was empty and silent [???] and hardly a
trickle of water flowed among the brown and red - stained stones of its bed ;
but on the near side there was a path [???] much broken and decayed [???] that wound
its way among the ruined walls and paving - stones of an ancient [???] .
' ah ! here it is at last ! ' said [???] . ` this is where the stream ran :
[???] [???] the gate - stream [???] they used to call it . but what has happened to
the water [???] i cannot guess ; it used to be swift and noisy . come ! we must
hurry on . we are late . '
the company were [???] and tired ; but they [???] [???] along
the rough and winding track for many miles . the sun turned from the noon and
began to go west . after a brief halt and a hasty meal they went on again .
before them the mountains frowned [???] but their path lay in a deep trough of
land and they could see only the higher shoulders and the far eastward
peaks .
at length they came to a sharp bend . there the road [???] which had been
veering southwards between the brink of the channel and a steep fall of the

land to the left [???] turned and went due east again . rounding the corner they
saw before them a low cliff [???] some five fathoms high [???] with a broken and
jagged top . over it a trickling water dripped [???] through a wide cleft that
seemed to have been carved out by a fall that had once been strong and full .
` indeed things have changed ! ' said [???] . ` but there is no mistaking
the place . there is all that remains of the stair falls . if i remember
right [???] there was a flight of steps cut in the rock at their side [???] but the
main road wound away left and climbed with several loops up to the level
ground at the top . there used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls right
up to the walls of moria [???] and the [???] flowed through it with the road
beside it . let us go and see what things are like now ! '
they found the stone steps without difficulty [???] and [???] sprang swiftly
up them [???] followed by [???] and [???] . when they reached the top they saw
that they could go no further that way [???] and the reason for the drying up of
the gate - stream was revealed . behind them the sinking sun filled the cool
western sky with [???] gold . before them stretched a dark still lake .
neither sky nor sunset was reflected on its sullen surface . the [???] had
been dammed and had filled all the valley . beyond the [???] water were
reared vast cliffs [???] their stern faces [???] in the fading light : final and
[???] . no sign of gate or entrance [???] not a [???] or crack could [???]
see in the frowning stone .
` there are the walls of moria [???] ' said [???] [???] pointing across the
water . ` and there the gate stood once upon a time [???] the elven door at the end
of the road from hollin by which we have come . but this way is blocked . none
of the company [???] i guess [???] will wish to swim this gloomy water at the end of
the day . it has an unwholesome look . '
` we must find a way round the northern edge [???] ' said [???] . ` the first
thing for the company to do is to climb up by the main path and see where
that will lead us . even if there were no lake [???] we could not get our
[???] - pony up this stair . '
` but in any case we cannot take the poor beast into the mines [???] ' said
[???] . ` the road under the mountains is a dark road [???] and there are places
narrow and steep which he cannot tread [???] even if we can . '
` poor old bill ! ' said [???] . ` i had not thought of that . and poor sam !
i wonder what he will say ? '
` i am sorry [???] ' said [???] . ` poor bill has been a useful companion and
it goes to my heart to turn him [???] now . i would have travelled lighter

and brought no animal [???] least of all this one that sam is fond of [???] if i had
had my way . i feared all along that we should be obliged to take this road . '
the day was drawing to its end [???] and cold stars were [???] in the sky
high above the sunset [???] when the company [???] with all the speed they could [???]
climbed up the [???] and reached the side of the lake . in breadth it looked
to be no more than two or three [???] at the widest point . how far it
stretched away southward they could not see in the failing light ; but its
northern end was no more than half a mile from where they stood [???] and between
the stony ridges that enclosed the valley and the water ' s edge there was a
rim of open ground . they hurried forward [???] for they had still a mile or two
to go before they could reach the point on the far shore that [???] was
making for ; and then he had still to find the doors .
when they came to the northernmost corner of the lake they found a
narrow creek that barred their way . it was green and [???] [???] thrust out
like a [???] arm towards the enclosing hills . [???] strode forward
[???] [???] and found that the water was shallow [???] no more than ankle - deep at
the edge . behind him they walked in file [???] threading their way with care [???] for
under the weedy [???] were sliding and greasy stones [???] and footing was
treacherous . [???] [???] with disgust at the touch of the dark unclean
water on his feet .
as sam [???] the last of the company [???] led bill up on to the dry ground on
the far side [???] there came a soft sound : a swish [???] followed by a plop [???] as if a
fish had disturbed the still surface of the water . turning quickly they saw
ripples [???] black - edged with shadow in the waning light : great rings were
widening outwards from a point far out in the lake . there was a [???]
noise [???] and then silence . the [???] deepened [???] and the last gleams of the
sunset were veiled in cloud .
[???] now pressed on at a great pace [???] and the others followed as
quickly as they could . they reached the strip of dry land between the lake
and the cliffs : it was narrow [???] often hardly a dozen yards across [???] and
[???] with fallen rock and stones ; but they found a way [???] hugging the
cliff [???] and keeping as far from the dark water as they might . a mile
southwards along the shore they came upon holly trees . stumps and dead
boughs were rotting in the shallows [???] the remains it seemed of old thickets [???]
or of a hedge that had once lined the road across the drowned valley . but
close under the cliff there stood [???] still strong and living [???] . two tall
trees [???] larger than any trees of holly that [???] had ever seen or imagined .

their great roots spread from the wall to the water . under the looming
cliffs they had looked like mere bushes [???] when seen far off from the top of
the stair ; but now they towered overhead [???] stiff [???] dark [???] and silent [???] throwing
deep night - shadows about their feet [???] standing like [???] pillars at the
end of the road .
` well [???] here we are at last ! ' said [???] . ' here the elven - way from
hollin ended . holly was the token of the people of that land [???] and they
planted it here to mark the end of their domain ; for the west - door was made
chiefly for their use in their traffic with the lords of moria . those were
happier days [???] when there was still close friendship at times between folk of
different race [???] even between [???] and elves . '
' it was not the fault of the [???] that the friendship waned [???] ' said
[???] .
' i have not heard that it was the fault of the elves [???] ' said legolas .
' i have heard both [???] ' said [???] ; ' and i will not give judgement now .
but i beg you two [???] legolas and [???] [???] at least to be friends [???] and to help
me . i need you both . the doors are shut and hidden [???] and the sooner we find
them the better . night is at hand ! '
turning to the others he said : ' while i am searching [???] will you each
make ready to enter the mines ? for here i fear we must say farewell to our
good bea st of burden . you must lay aside much of the stuff that we brought
against bitter weather : you will not need it inside [???] nor [???] i hope [???] when we
come through and journey on down into the south . instead each of us must
take a share of what the pony carried [???] especially the food and the
water - skins . '
' but you can ' t leave poor old bill behind in this forsaken place [???] mr .
[???] ! ' cried sam [???] angry and distressed . ` i won ' t have it [???] and that ' s
flat . after he has come so far and all ! '
' i am sorry [???] sam [???] ' said the [???] . ` but when the door opens i do not
think you will be able to drag your bill inside [???] into the long dark of
moria . you will have to choose between bill and your master . '
' he ' d follow mr . [???] into a dragon ' s den [???] if i led him [???] ' protested
sam . ` it ' d be nothing short of murder to turn him loose with all these
wolves about . '
' it will be short of murder [???] i hope [???] ' said [???] . he laid his hand on
the pony ' s head [???] and spoke in a low voice . ` go with words of guard and
guiding on you [???] ' he said . ` you are a wise beast [???] and have learned much in

[???] . make your ways to places where you can find grass [???] and so come in
time to [???] ' s house [???] or wherever you wish to go .
` there [???] sam ! he will have quite as much chance of escaping wolves and
getting home as we have . '
sam stood sullenly by the pony and returned no answer . bill [???] seeming to
understand well what was going on [???] [???] up to him [???] putting his nose to
sam ' s ear . sam burst into tears [???] and [???] with the straps [???] unlading all
the pony ' s packs and throwing them on the ground . the others sorted out the
goods [???] making a pile of all that could be left behind [???] and dividing up the
rest .
when this was done they turned to watch [???] . he appeared to have
done nothing . he was standing between the two trees gazing at the blank wall
of the cliff [???] as if he would bore a hole into it with his eyes . [???] was
wandering about [???] tapping the stone here and there with his axe . legolas was
pressed against the rock [???] as if listening .
' well [???] here we are and all ready [???] ' said merry ; ` but where are the
doors ? i can ' t see any sign of them . '
' dwarf - doors are not made to be seen when shut [???] ' said [???] . ` they are
invisible [???] and their own masters cannot find them or open them [???] if their
secret is forgotten . '
' but this door was not made to be a secret known only to [???] [???] ' said
[???] [???] coming suddenly to life and turning round . ` unless things are
altogether changed [???] eyes that know what to look for may discover the signs . '
he walked forward to the wall . right between the shadow of the trees
there was a smooth space [???] and over this he passed his hands to and fro [???]
muttering words under his breath . then he stepped back .
' look ! ' he said . ` can you see anything now ? '
the moon now shone upon the grey face of the rock ; but they could see
nothing else for a while . then slowly on the surface [???] where the [???] ' s
hands had passed [???] faint lines appeared [???] like slender veins of silver running
in the stone . at first they were no more than pale [???] - threads [???] so fine
that they only [???] fitfully where the moon caught them [???] but steadily
they grew broader and clearer [???] until their design could be guessed .

at the top [???] as high as [???] could reach [???] was an arch of [???]
letters in an elvish character . below [???] though the threads were in places
[???] or broken [???] the outline could be seen of an anvil and a hammer

[???] by a crown with seven stars . beneath these again were two trees [???]
each bearing [???] moons . more clearly than all else there shone forth in
the middle of the door a single star with many rays .
` there are the [???] of durin ! ' cried [???] .
` and there is the tree of the high elves ! ' said legolas .
` and the star of the house of flanor [???] ' said [???] . ` they are wrought
of [???] that mirrors only starlight and moonlight [???] and sleeps until it
is touched by one who speaks words now long forgotten in middle - earth . it is
long since i heard them [???] and i thought deeply before i could recall them to
my mind . '
' what does the writing say ? ' asked [???] [???] who was trying to [???]
the [???] on the arch . ' i thought i knew the elf - letters but i cannot
read these . '
` the words are in the elven - tongue of the west of middle - earth in the
elder days [???] ' answered [???] . ' but they do not say anything of importance
to us . they say only : the doors of durin [???] lord of moria . speak [???] friend [???] and
enter . and underneath small and faint is written : i [???] narvi [???] made them .
[???] of hollin drew these signs . '
` what does it mean by speak [???] friend [???] and enter ? ' asked merry .
' that is plain enough [???] ' said [???] . ` if you are a friend [???] speak the
[???] [???] and the doors will open [???] and you can enter . '
' yes [???] ' said [???] [???] ' these doors are probably governed by words . some
dwarf - gates will open only at special times [???] or for particular persons ; and
some have locks and keys that are still needed when all necessary times and
words are known . these doors have no key . in the days of durin they were not
secret . they usually stood open and doorwards sat here . but if they were
shut [???] any who knew the opening word could speak it and pass in . at lea st so
it is recorded [???] is it not [???] [???] ? '
' it is [???] ' said the dwarf . ` but what the word was is not remembered .
narvi and his craft and all his kindred have vanished from the earth . '
' but do not you know the word [???] [???] ? ' asked [???] in surprise .
` no ! ' said the [???] .
the others looked dismayed ; only [???] [???] who knew [???] well [???]
remained silent and [???] .
' then what was the use of bringing us to this accursed spot ? ' cried
[???] [???] glancing back with a shudder at the dark water . ` you told us that
you had once passed through the mines . how could that be [???] if you did not

know how to enter ? '
` the answer to your first question [???] [???] [???] ' said the [???] [???] ` is that
i do not know the word - yet . but we shall soon see . and [???] ' he added [???] with a
glint in his eyes under their [???] brows [???] ' you may ask what is the use
of my deeds when they are proved useless . as for your other question : do you
doubt my tale ? or have you no wits left ? i did not enter this way . i came
from the east .
` if you wish to know [???] i will tell you that these doors open outwards .
from the inside you may thrust them open with your hands . from the outside
nothing will move them save the spell of command . they cannot be forced
inwards . '
` what are you going to do then ? ' asked [???] [???] [???] by the
[???] ' s [???] brows .
` knock on the doors with your head [???] [???] took [???] ' said [???] . ` but
if that does not shatter them [???] and i am allowed a little peace from foolish
questions [???] i will seek for the opening words .
` i once knew every spell in all the tongues of elves or men or [???]
that was ever used for such a purpose . i can still remember ten score of
them without searching in my mind . but on ly a few trials [???] i think [???] will be
needed ; and i shall not have to call on [???] for words of the secret
dwarf - tongue that they teach to none . the opening words were elvish [???] like
the writing on the arch : that seems certain . '
he stepped up to the rock again [???] and lightly touched with his staff the
silver star in the middle beneath the sign of the anvil .
annon [???] [???] edro hi ammen !
[???] [???] [???] lasto beth lammen !
he said in a commanding voice . the silver lines faded [???] but the blank
grey stone did not stir .
many times he repeated these words in different order [???] or varied them .
then he tried other spells . one after another [???] speaking now faster and
louder [???] now soft and slow . then he spoke many single words of elvish speech .
nothing happened . the cliff towered into the night [???] the countless stars were
kindled [???] the wind blew cold [???] and the doors stood fast .
again [???] approached the wall [???] and lifting up his arms he spoke in
tones of command and rising wrath . edro [???] edro ! he cried [???] and struck the rock
with his staff . open [???] open ! he shouted [???] and followed it with the same
command in every language that had ever been spoken in the west of

middle - earth . then he threw his staff on the ground [???] and sat down in
silence .
at that moment from far off the wind bore to their listening ears the
howling of wolves . bill the pony started in fear [???] and sam sprang to his side
and whispered softly to him .
' do not let him run away ! ' said [???] . ' it seems that we shall need
him still [???] if the wolves do not find us . how i hate this foul pool ! ' he
stooped and picking up a large stone he cast it far into the dark water .
the stone vanished with a soft slap ; but at the same instant there was
a swish and a bubble . great [???] rings formed on the surface out beyond
where the stone had fallen [???] and they moved slowly towards the foot of the
cliff .
' why did you do that [???] [???] ? ' said [???] . ` i hate this place [???] too [???]
and i am afraid . i don ' t know of what : not of wolves [???] or the dark behind the
doors [???] but of something else . i am afraid of the pool . don ' t disturb it ! '
' l wish we could get away ! ' said merry .
' why doesn ' t [???] do something quick ? ' said [???] .
[???] took no notice of them . he sat with his head bowed [???] either in
despair or in anxious thought . the mournful howling of the wolves was heard
again . the ripples on the water grew and came closer ; some were already
lapping on the shore .
with a suddenness that startled them all the [???] sprang to his feet .
he was laughing ! ` i have it ! ' he cried . ' of course [???] of course ! absurdly
simple [???] like most [???] when you see the answer . '
picking up his staff he stood before the rock and said in a clear
voice : mellon !
the star shone out briefly and faded again . then silently a great
doorway was outlined [???] though not a crack or joint had been visible before .
slowly it divided in the middle and swung outwards inch by inch [???] until both
doors lay back against the wall . through the opening a shadowy stair could
be seen climbing steeply up ; but beyond the lower steps the darkness was
deeper than the night . the company stared in wonder .
` i was wrong after all [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and [???] too . merry [???] of all
people [???] was on the right track . the opening word was [???] on the
archway all the time ! the translation should have been : say [???] friend [???] and
enter . i had only to speak the elvish word for friend and the doors opened .
quite simple . too simple for a learned lore - master in these suspicious days .

those were happier times . now let us go ! '
he strode forward and set his foot on the lowest step . but at that
moment several things happened . [???] felt something seize him by the ankle [???]
and he fell with a cry . bill the pony gave a wild neigh of fear [???] and turned
tail and dashed away along the [???] into the darkness . sam leaped after
him [???] and then hearing [???] ' s cry he ran back again [???] weeping and cursing .
the others swung round and saw the waters of the lake seething [???] as if a host
of snakes were swimming up from the southern end .
out from the water a long sinuous tentacle had [???] ; it was
pale - green and [???] and wet . its fingered end had ho ld of [???] ' s foot
and was dragging him into the water . sam on his knees was now [???] at it
with a knife .
the arm let go of [???] [???] and sam pulled him away [???] crying out for help .
twenty others arms came [???] out . the dark water boiled [???] and there was a
hideous stench .
` into the gateway ! up the stairs ! quick ! ' shouted [???] leaping
back . rousing them from the horror that seemed to have rooted all but sam to
the ground where they stood [???] he drove them forward .
they were just in time . sam and [???] were only a few steps up [???] and
[???] had just begun to climb [???] when the groping tentacles [???] across
the narrow shore and fingered the cliff - wall and the doors . one came
[???] over the [???] [???] [???] in the starlight . [???] turned
and paused . if he was considering what word would close the gate again from
within [???] there was no need . many coiling arms seized the doors on either
side [???] and with horrible strength [???] swung them round . with a [???] echo
they [???] [???] and all light was lost . a noise of rending and [???] came
dully through the ponderous stone .
sam [???] [???] to [???] ' s arm [???] [???] on a step in the black
darkness . ` poor old bill ! ' he said in a choking voice . ` poor old bill !
wolves and snakes ! but the snakes were too much for him . i had to choose [???]
mr . [???] . i had to come with you . '
they heard [???] go back down the steps and thrust his staff against
the doors . there was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled [???] . but the
doors did not open . ` well [???] well ! ' said the [???] . ` the passage is blocked
behind us now and there is only one way out - - on the other side of the
mountains . i fear from the sounds that [???] have been piled up [???] and the
trees [???] and thrown across the gate . i am sorry ; for the trees were

beautiful [???] and had stood so long . '
` i felt that something horrible was near from the moment that my foot
first touched the water [???] ' said [???] . ' what was the thing [???] or were there
many of them ? '
' i do not know [???] ' answered [???] [???] ' but the arms were all guided by one
purpose . something has crept [???] or has been driven out of dark waters under
the mountains . there are older and fouler things than [???] in the deep
places of the world . ' he did not speak aloud his thought that whatever it
was that dwelt in the lake [???] it had seized on [???] first among all the
company .
[???] muttered under his breath [???] but the echoing stone magnified the
sound to a hoarse whisper that all could hear : ` in the deep places of the
world ! and thither we are going against my wish . who will lead us now in
this deadly dark ? '
' i will [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and [???] shall walk with me . follow my staff !
'
as the [???] passed on ahead up the great steps [???] he held his staff
aloft [???] and from its tip there came a faint radiance . the wide stairway was
sound and [???] . two hundred steps they counted [???] broad and shallow ;
and
at the top they found an arched passage with a level floor leading on into
the dark .
` let us sit and rest and have something to eat [???] here on the landing [???]
since we can ' t find a dining - room ! ' said [???] . he had begun to shake off
the terror of the clutching arm [???] and suddenly he felt extremely hungry .
the proposal was welcomed by all ; and they sat down on the upper steps [???]
dim figures in the gloom . after they had eaten [???] [???] gave them each a
third sip of the [???] of [???] .
` it will not last much longer [???] i am afraid [???] ' he said ; ' but i think we
need it after that horror at the gate . and unless we have great luck [???] we
shall need all that is left before we see the other side ! go carefully with
the water [???] too ! there are many streams and wells in the mines [???] but they
should not be touched . we may not have a chance of filling our skins and
bottles till we come down into [???] dale . '
' how long is that going to take us ? ' asked [???] .
' i cannot say [???] ' answered [???] . ' it depends on many chances . but
going straight [???] without [???] or losing our way [???] we shall take three or

four marches [???] i expect . it cannot be less than forty miles from west - door to
east - gate in a direct line [???] and the road may wind much . '
after only a brief rest they started on their way again . all were eager
to get the journey over as quickly as possible [???] and were willing [???] tired as
they were [???] to go on marching still for several hours . [???] walked in
front as before . in his left hand he held up his [???] staff [???] the light
of which just showed the ground before his feet ; in his right he held his
sword [???] . behind him came [???] [???] his eyes [???] in the dim light
as he turned his head from side to side . behind the dwarf walked [???] [???] and
he had drawn the short sword [???] sting . no gleam came from the blades of sting
or of [???] ; and that was some comfort [???] for being the work of elvish
smiths in the elder days these swords shone with a cold light [???] if any [???]
were near at hand . behind [???] went sam [???] and after him legolas [???] and the
young [???] [???] and [???] . in the dark at the rear [???] grim and silent [???] walked
[???] .
the passage twisted round a few turns [???] and then began to descend . it
went steadily down for a long while before it became level once again . the
air grew hot and [???] [???] but it was not foul [???] and at times they felt
currents of cooler air upon their faces [???] issuing from half - guessed openings
in the walls . there were many of these . in the pale ray of the [???] ' s
staff [???] [???] caught [???] of stairs and arches and of other passages and
[???] [???] [???] up [???] or running steeply down [???] or opening blankly dark on
either side . it was [???] beyond hope of remembering .
[???] aided [???] very little [???] except by h is stout courage . at least
he was not [???] as were most of the others [???] troubled by the mere darkness in
itself . often the [???] consulted him at points where the choice of way was
doubtful ; but it was always [???] who had the final word . the mines of
moria were vast and [???] beyond the imagination of [???] [???] [???] ' s son [???]
dwarf of the mountain - race though he was . to [???] the far - off memories of
a journey long before were now of little help [???] but even in the gloom and
despite all windings of the road he knew whither he wished to go [???] and he did
not falter [???] as long as there was a path that led towards his goal .
` do not be afraid ! ' said [???] . there was a pause longer than usual [???]
and [???] and [???] were whispering together ; the others were crowded
behind [???] waiting anxiously . ` do not be afraid ! i have been with him on many a
journey [???] if never on one so dark ; and there are tales of [???] of
greater deeds of his than any that i have seen . he will not go [???] - if

there is any path to find . he has led us in here against our fears [???] but he
will lead us out again [???] at whatever cost to himself . he is surer of finding
the way home in a blind night than the cats of queen ber [???] thiel . '
it was well for the company that they had such a guide . they had no
fuel nor any means of making torches ; in the desperate scramble at the doors
many things had been left behind . but without any light they would soon have
come to grief . there were not only many roads to choose from [???] there were
also in many places holes and [???] [???] and dark wells beside the path in
which their passing feet echoed . there were [???] and [???] in the walls
and floor [???] and every now and then a crack would open right before their
feet . the widest was more than seven feet across [???] and it was long before
[???] could summon enough courage to leap over the dreadful gap . the noise
of churning water came up from far below [???] as if some great mill - wheel was
turning in the depths .
` rope ! ' muttered sam . ` i knew i ' d want it [???] if i hadn ' t got it ! '
as these dangers became more frequent their march became slower .
already they seemed to have been tramping on [???] on [???] endlessly to the
mountains ' roots . they were more than weary [???] and yet there seemed no comfort
in the thought of halting anywhere . [???] ' s spirits had risen for a while
after his escape [???] and after food and a draught of the cordial ; but now a
deep [???] [???] growing to dread [???] crept over him again . though he had been
healed in [???] of the knife - stroke [???] that grim wound had not been
without effect . his senses were sharper and more aware of things that could
not be seen . one sign of change that he soon had noticed was that he could
see more in the dark than any of his companions [???] save perhaps [???] . and
he was in any case the bearer of the ring : it hung upon its chain against
his breast [???] and at whiles it seemed a heavy weight . he felt the certainty of
evil ahead and of evil following ; but he said nothing . he gripped tighter on
the hilt of his sword and went on [???] .
the company behind him spoke seldom [???] and then only in hurried whispers .
there was no sound but the sound of their own feet ; the dull stump of
[???] ' s dwarf - boots ; the heavy tread of [???] ; the light step of legolas ;
the soft [???] scarce - heard patter of hobbit - feet ; and in the rear the slow firm
[???] of [???] with his long stride . when they halted for a moment
they heard nothing at all [???] unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and
drip of unseen water . yet [???] began to hear [???] or to imagine that he heard [???]
something else : like the faint fall of soft bare feet . it was never loud

enough [???] or near enough [???] for him to feel certain that he heard it ; but once
it had started it never stopped [???] while the company was moving . but it was
not an echo [???] for when they halted it pattered on for a little all by itself [???]
and then grew still .
it was after nightfall when they had entered the mines . they had been
going for several hours with only brief halts [???] when [???] came to his
first serious check . before him stood a wide dark arch opening into three
passages : all led in the same general direction [???] eastwards ; but the
left - hand passage [???] down [???] while the right - hand climbed up [???] and the
middle way seemed to run on [???] smooth and level but very narrow .
' i have no memory of this place at all ! ' said [???] [???] standing
uncertainly under the arch . he held up his staff in the hope of finding some
marks or [???] that might help his choice ; but nothing of the kind was
to be seen . ` i am too weary to decide [???] ' he said [???] shaking his head . ` and i
expect that you are all as weary as i am [???] or wearier . we had better halt
here for what is left of the night . you know what i mean ! in here it is ever
dark ; but outside the late moon is riding westward and the middle - night has
passed . '
` poor old bill ! ' said sam . ' i wonder where he is . i hope those wolves
haven ' t got him yet . '
to the left of the great arch they found a stone door : it was half
closed [???] but swung back easily to a gentle thrust . beyond there seemed to lie
a wide chamber cut in the rock .
` steady ! steady ! ' cried [???] as merry and [???] pushed forward [???]
glad to find a place where they could rest with at least more feeling of
shelter than in the open passage . ` steady ! you do not know what is inside
yet . i will go first . '
he went in [???] [???] and the others filed behind . ` there ! ' he said [???]
pointing with his staff to the middle of the floor . before his feet they saw
a large round hole like the mouth of a well . broken and rusty chains lay at
the edge and trailed down into the black pit . fragments of stone lay near .
' one of you might have fallen in and still be wondering when you were
going to strike the bottom [???] ' said [???] to merry . ' let the guide go first
while you have one . '
' this seems to have been a guardroom [???] made for the watching of the
three passages [???] ' said [???] . ` that hole was plainly a well for the guards '
use [???] covered with a stone lid . but the lid is broken [???] and we must all take

care in the dark . '
[???] felt curiously attracted by the well . while the others were
[???] blankets and making beds against the walls of the chamber [???] as far
as possible from the hole in the floor [???] he crept to the edge and peered
over . a chill air seemed to strike his face [???] rising from invisible depths .
moved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loose stone [???] and let it drop . he
felt his heart beat many times before there was any sound . then far below [???]
as if the stone had fallen into deep water in some [???] place [???] there
came a plunk [???] very distant [???] but magnified and repeated in the hollow shaft .
` what ' s that ? ' cried [???] . he was relieved when [???] confessed
what he had done ; but he was angry [???] and [???] could see his eye [???] .
' fool of a took ! ' he growled . ' this is a serious journey [???] not a hobbit
walking - party . throw yourself in next time [???] and then you will be no further
[???] . now be quiet ! '
nothing more was heard for several minutes ; but then there came out of
the depths faint knocks : tom - tap [???] tap - tom . they stopped [???] and when the echoes
had died away [???] they were repeated : tap - tom [???] tom - tap [???] tap - tap [???] tom . they
sounded [???] like signals of some sort ; but after a while the
knocking died away and was not heard again .
' that was the sound of a hammer [???] or i have never heard one [???] ' said
[???] .
` yes [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and i do not like it . it may have nothing to do
with [???] ' s foolish stone ; but probably something has been disturbed
that would have been better left quiet . pray [???] do nothing of the kind again !
let us hope we shall get some rest without further trouble . you [???] [???] [???] can
go on the first watch [???] as a reward [???] ' he growled [???] as he rolled himself in a
blanket .
[???] sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark ; but he kept on
turning round [???] fearing that some unknown thing would [???] up out of the
well . he wished he could cover the hole [???] if only with a blanket [???] but he
dared not move or go near it [???] even though [???] seemed to be asleep .
actually [???] was awake [???] though lying still and silent . he was deep
in thought [???] trying to recall every memory of his former journey in the
mines [???] and considering anxiously the next course that he should take ; a
false turn now might be [???] . after an hour he rose up and came over
to [???] .
` get into a corner and have a sleep [???] my lad [???] ' he said in a kindly tone .

' you want to sleep [???] i expect . i cannot get a wink [???] so i may as well do the
watching . '
' i know what is the matter with me [???] ' he muttered [???] as he sat down by the
door . ' i need smoke ! i have not tasted it since the morning before the
[???] . '
the last thing that [???] saw [???] as sleep took him [???] was a dark glimpse
of the old [???] [???] on the floor [???] shielding a glowing chip in his
[???] hands between his knees . the [???] for a moment showed his sharp
nose . and the puff of smoke .
it was [???] who roused them all from sleep . he had sat and watched
all alone for about six hours [???] and had let the others rest . ` and in the
watches i have made up my mind [???] ' he said . ` i do not like the feel of the
middle way ; and i do not like the smell of the left - hand way : there is foul
air down there [???] or i am no guide . i shall take the right - hand passage . it is
time we began to climb up again . '
for eight dark hours [???] not counting two brief halts [???] they marched on ;
and they met no danger [???] and heard nothing [???] and saw nothing but the faint
gleam of the [???] ' s light [???] [???] like a will - o ' - the - wisp in front of
them . the passage they had chosen wound steadily upwards . as far as they
could judge it went in great mounting curves [???] and as it rose it grew [???]
and wider . there were now no openings to other [???] or [???] on
either side [???] and the floor was level and sound [???] without pits or cracks .
evidently they had struck what once had been an important road ; and they
went forward quicker than they had done on their first march .
in this way they advanced some fifteen miles [???] measured in a direct line
east [???] though they must have actually walked twenty miles or more . as the
road climbed upwards ` [???] ' s spirits rose a little ; but he still felt
oppressed [???] and still at times he heard [???] or thought he heard [???] away behind the
company and beyond the fall and patter of their feet [???] a following footstep
that was not an echo .
they had marched as far as the [???] could endure without a rest [???] and
all were thinking of a place where they could sleep [???] when suddenly the walls
to right and left vanished . they seemed to have passed through some arched
doorway into a black and empty space . there was a great draught of warmer
air behind them [???] and before them the darkness was cold on their faces . they
halted and crowded anxiously together .
[???] seemed pleased . ` i chose the right way [???] ' he said . ` at last we

are coming to the habitable parts [???] and i guess that we are not far now from
the eastern side . but we are high up [???] a good deal higher than the [???]
gate [???] unless i am mistaken . from the feeling of the air we must be in a wide
hall . i will now risk a little real light . '
he raised his staff [???] and for a brief instant there was blaze like a
flash of lightning . great shadows sprang up and fled [???] and for a second they
saw a vast roof far above their heads [???] by many mighty pillars hewn of
stone . before them and on either side stretched a huge empty hall ; its black
walls [???] polished and smooth as glass [???] flashed and glittered . three other
entrances they saw [???] dark black arches : one straight before them eastwards [???]
and one on either side . then the light went out .
` that is all that i shall venture on for the present [???] ' said [???] .
' there used to be great windows on the mountain - side [???] and shafts leading out
to the light in the upper reaches of the mines . i think we have reached them
now [???] but it is night outside again [???] and we cannot tell until morning . if i
am right [???] tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in . but in the
meanwhile we had better go no further . let us rest [???] if we can . things have
gone well so far [???] and the greater part of the dark road is over . but we are
not through yet [???] and it is a long way down to the gates that open on the
world . '
the company spent that night in the great [???] hall [???] [???] close
together in a corner to escape the draught : there seemed to be a steady
inflow of chill air through the eastern archway . all about them as they lay
hung the darkness [???] hollow and immense [???] and they were oppressed by the
loneliness and vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly branching stairs
and passages . the wildest imaginings that dark rumour had ever suggested to
the [???] fell altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of moria .
` there must have been a mighty crowd of [???] here at one time ' said
sam ; ` and every one of them busier than [???] for five hundred years to
make all this [???] and most in hard rock too ! what did they do it all for ? they
didn ' t live in these darksome holes surely ? '
` these are not holes [???] ' said [???] . ` this is the great realm and city of
the [???] . and of old it was not darksome [???] but full of light and
[???] [???] as is still remembered in our songs . '
he rose and standing in the dark he began to chant in a deep voice [???]
while the echoes ran away into the roof .
the world was young [???] the mountains green [???]

no stain yet on the moon was seen [???]
no words were laid on stream or stone
when durin woke and walked alone .
he named the nameless hills and dells ;
he drank from yet untasted wells ;
he stooped and looked in [???] [???]
and saw a crown of stars appear [???]
as gems upon a silver thread [???]
above the shadow of his head .

the world was fair [???] the mountains tall [???]
in elder days before the fall
of mighty kings in [???]
and [???] [???] who now beyond
the western seas have passed away :
the world was fair in durin ' s day .

a king he was on carven throne
in many - pillared halls of stone
with golden roof and silver floor [???]
and runes of power upon the door .
the light of sun and star and moon
in shining lamps of crystal hewn
[???] by cloud or shade of night
there shone for ever fair and bright .

there hammer on the anvil smote [???]
there [???] clove [???] and graver wrote ;
there forged was blade [???] and bound was hilt ;
the delver mined [???] the mason built .
there [???] [???] pearl [???] and opal pale [???]
and metal wrought like fishes ' mail [???]
buckler and [???] [???] axe and sword [???]
and shining spears were laid in hoard .

[???] then were durin ' s folk
beneath the mountains music woke :

the harpers harped [???] the [???] sang [???]
and at the gates the trumpets rang .

the world is grey [???] the mountains old [???]
the forge ' s fire is ashen - cold
no harp is wrung [???] no hammer falls :
the darkness dwells in durin ' s halls
the shadow lies upon his tomb
in moria [???] in [???] - dym .
but still the sunken stars appear
in dark and windless [???] ;
there lies his crown in water deep [???]
till durin wakes again from sleep .
` i like that ! ' said sam . ` i should like to learn it . in moria [???] in
[???] - dym ! but it makes the darkness seem heavier [???] thinking of all those
lamps . are there piles of jewels and gold lying about here st ill ? '
[???] was silent . having sung his song he would say no more .
` piles of jewels ? ' said [???] . ` no . the [???] have often [???]
moria ; there is nothing left in the upper halls . and since the [???] fled [???]
no one dares to seek the shafts and [???] down in the deep places : they
are drowned in water - - or in a shadow of fear . '
` then what do the [???] want to come back for ? ' asked sam .
' for [???] [???] ' answered [???] . ` the wealth of moria was not in gold
and jewels [???] the toys of the [???] ; nor in iron [???] their servant . such things
they found here [???] it is true [???] especially iron ; but they did not need to delve
for them : all things that they desired they could obtain in traffic . for
here alone in the world was found moria - silver [???] or true - silver as some have
called it : [???] is the elvish name . the [???] have a name which they do
not tell . its worth was ten times that of gold [???] and now it is beyond price ;
for little is left above ground [???] and even the [???] dare not delve here for
it . the lodes lead away north towards [???] [???] and down to darkness . the
[???] tell no tale ; but even as [???] was the foundation of their
wealth [???] so also it was their destruction : they delved too [???] and too
deep [???] and disturbed that from which they fled [???] durin ' s bane . of what they
brought to light the [???] have gathered nearly all [???] and given it in tribute
to [???] [???] who covets it .
` [???] ! all folk desired it . it could be beaten like copper [???] and

polished like glass ; and the [???] could make of it a metal [???] light and yet
harder than tempered steel . its beauty was like to that of common silver [???]
but the beauty of [???] did not tarnish or grow dim . the elves dearly
loved it [???] and among many uses they made of it [???] [???] [???] [???] which you
saw upon the doors . [???] had a [???] of [???] - rings that [???] gave
him . i wonder what has become of it ? gathering dust still in michel delving
[???] - house [???] i suppose . '
` what ? ' cried [???] [???] startled out of his silence . ` a [???] of
moria - silver ? that was a kingly gift ! '
' yes [???] ' said [???] . ` i never told him [???] but its worth was greater than
the value of the whole shire and everything in it . '
[???] said nothing [???] but he put his hand under his tunic and touched the
rings of his mail - shirt . he felt [???] to think that he had been walking
about with the price of the shire under his jacket . had [???] known ? he felt
no doubt that [???] knew quite well . it was indeed a kingly gift . but now
his thoughts had been carried away from the dark mines [???] to [???] [???] to
[???] [???] and to bag end in the days while [???] was still there . he wished
with all his heart that he was back there [???] and in those days [???] mowing the
lawn [???] or pottering among the flowers [???] and that he had never heard of moria [???]
or [???] - - or the ring .
a deep silence fell . one by one the others fell asleep . [???] was on
guard . as if it were a breath that came in through unseen doors out of deep
places [???] dread came over him . his hands were cold and his brow damp . he
listened . all his mind was given to listening and nothing else for two slow
hours ; but he heard no sound [???] not even the imagined echo of a footfall .
his watch was nearly over [???] when [???] far off where he guessed that the
western archway stood [???] he fancied that he could see two pale points of
light [???] almost like [???] eyes . he started . his head had nodded . ` i must
have nearly fallen asleep on guard [???] ' he thought . ` i was on the edge of a
dream . ' he stood up and rubbed his eyes [???] and remained standing [???] peering into
the dark [???] until he was relieved by legolas .
when he lay down he quickly went to sleep [???] but it seemed to him that
the dream went on : he heard whispers [???] and saw the two pale points of light
approaching [???] slowly . he woke and found that the others were speaking softly
near him [???] and that a dim light was falling on his face . high up above the
eastern archway through a shaft near the roof came a long pale gleam ; and
across the hall through the northern arch light also [???] faint and

distantly .
[???] sat up . ` good morning ! ' said [???] : ` for morning it is again
at last . i was right [???] you see . we are high up on the east side of moria .
before today is over we ought to find the great gates and see the waters of
[???] lying in the [???] dale before us . '
' i shall be glad [???] ' said [???] . ` i have looked on moria [???] and it is very
great [???] but it has become dark and dreadful ; and we have found no sign of my
kindred . i doubt now that balin ever came here . '
after they had breakfasted [???] decided to go on again at once . ` we
are tired [???] but we shall rest better when we are outside [???] ' he said . ` i think
that none of us will wish to spend another night in moria . '
` no indeed ! ' said [???] . ` which way shall we take ? yonder eastward
arch ? '
' maybe [???] ' said [???] . ` but i du not know yet exactly where we are .
unless i am quite [???] [???] i guess that we are above and to the north of the
great gates ; and it may not be easy to find the right road down to them . the
eastern arch will probably prove to be the way that we must take ; but before
we make up our minds we ought to look about us . let us go towards that light
in the north door . if we cou ld find a window it would help [???] but i fear that
the light comes only down deep shafts . '
following his lead the company passed under the northern arch . they
found themselves in a wide corridor . as they went along it the glimmer grew
stronger [???] and they saw that it came through a doorway on their right . it was
high and flat - topped [???] and the stone door was still upon its [???] [???] standing
half open . beyond it was a large square chamber . it was dimly lit [???] but to
their eyes [???] after so long a time in the dark [???] it seemed [???] bright [???]
and they [???] as they entered .
their feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor [???] and [???] among
things lying in the doorway whose shapes they could not at first make out .
the chamber was lit by a wi de shaft high in the further eastern wall ; it
[???] upwards and [???] far above [???] a small square patch of blue sky could be
seen . the light of the shaft fell directly on a table in the middle of the
room : a single oblong block [???] about two feet high [???] upon which was laid a
great slab of white stone .
` it looks like a tomb [???] ' muttered [???] [???] and bent forwards with a
curious sense of [???] [???] to look more closely at it . [???] came
quickly to his side . on the slab runes were deeply graven :


' these are [???] ' s runes [???] such as were used of old in moria [???] ' said
[???] . ' here is written in the tongues of men and [???] :
balin son of [???]
lord of moria . '
' he is dead then [???] ' said [???] . ` i feared it was so . ' [???] cast his
hood over his face .




chapter 5 . the bridge of [???] - dym



the company of the ring stood silent beside the tomb of balin . [???]
thought of [???] and his long friendship with the dwarf [???] and of balin ' s
visit to the shire long ago . in that dusty chamber in the mountains it
seemed a thousand years ago and on the other side of the world .
at length they stirred and looked up [???] and began to search for anything
that would give them tidings of balin ' s fate [???] or show what had become of his
folk . there was another smaller door on the other side of the chamber [???] under
the shaft . by both the doors they could now see that many bones were lying [???]
and among them were broken swords and axe - heads [???] and cloven shields and
helms . some of the swords were crooked : orc - [???] with blackened blades .
there were many recesses cut in the rock of the walls [???] and in them were
large iron - bound chests of wood . all had been broken and [???] ; but
beside the [???] lid of one there lay the remains of a book . it had been
[???] and stabbed and partly burned [???] and it was so stained with black and
other dark marks like old blood that little of it could be read . [???]
lifted it carefully [???] but the leaves crackled and broke as he laid it on the
slab . he pored over it for some time without speaking . [???] and [???]
standing at his side could see [???] as he [???] turned the leaves [???] that they
were written by many different hands [???] in runes [???] both of moria and of dale [???]
and here and there in elvish script .
at last [???] looked up . ' it seems to be a record of the fortunes of
balin ' s folk [???] ' he said . ` i guess that it began with their coming to [???]
dale nigh on thirty years ago : the pages seem to have numbers referring to
the years after their arrival . the top page is marked one - - three [???] so at
least two are missing from the beginning . listen to this !
' we drove out [???] from the great gate and guard - - i think ; the next
word is [???] and burned ; probably room - - we slew many in the bright - - i
think - - sun in the dale . [???] was killed by an arrow . he slew the great .
then there is a blur followed by [???] under grass near mirror mere . the next
line or two i cannot read . then comes we have taken the [???] hall of
north end to dwell in . there is i cannot read what . a shaft is mentioned .
then balin has set up his seat in the chamber of [???] . '
' the chamber of records [???] ' said [???] . ` i guess that is where we now

stand . '
` well [???] i can read no more for a long way [???] ' said [???] [???] ' except the
word gold [???] and durin ' s axe and something helm . then balin is now lord of
moria . that seems to end a chapter . after some stars another hand begins [???]
and i can see we found [???] [???] and later the word [???] and then
something [???] i have it ! [???] ; and the last two lines uin to seek for the
upper armouries of third deep [???] something go westwards [???] a blur [???] to hollin
gate . '
[???] paused and set a few leaves aside . ' there are several pages of
the same sort [???] rather hastily written and much damaged [???] he said ; ` but i can
make little of them in this light . now there must be a number of leaves
missing [???] because they begin to be numbered five [???] the fifth year of the
colony [???] i suppose . let me see ! no [???] they are too cut and stained ; i cannot
read them . we might do better in the sunlight . wait ! here is something : a
large bold hand using an elvish script . '
' that would be ori ' s hand [???] ' said [???] [???] looking over the [???] ' s arm .
` he could write well and speedily [???] and often used the elvish characters . '
` i fear he had ill tidings to record in a fair hand [???] ' said [???] .
' the first clear word is sorrow [???] but the rest of the line is lost [???] unless it
ends in estre . yes [???] it must be [???] followed by day being the tenth of
[???] balin lord of moria fell in [???] dale . he went alone to look in
mirror mere . an orc shot him from behind a stone . we slew the orc [???] hut many
more . . . up from east up the [???] . the remainder of the page is so
[???] that i can hardly make anything out [???] but i think i can read we have
barred the gates [???] and then can hold them long if [???] and then perhaps horrible
and suffer . poor balin ! he seems to have kept the title that he took for
less than five years . i wonder what happened afterwards ; but there is no
time to [???] out the last few pages . here is the last page of all . ' he
paused and sighed .
` it is grim reading [???] ' he said . ' i fear their end was cruel . listen ! we
cannot get out . we cannot get out . they have taken the bridge and second
hall . frbr and luni and [???] fell there . then there are four lines smeared
so that i can only read went 5 days ago . the last lines run the pool is up
to the wall at westgate . the wa tcher in the water took uin . we cannot get
out . the end comes [???] and then drums [???] drums in the deep . i wonder what that
means . the last thing written is in a trailing [???] of elf - letters : they
are coming . there is nothing more . ' [???] paused and stood in silent

thought .
a sudden dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the company . ` we
cannot get out [???] ' muttered [???] . ' it was well for us that the pool had sunk
a little [???] and that the watcher was sleeping down at the southern end . '
[???] raised his head and looked round . ` they seem to have made a
last stand by both doors [???] ' he said ; ' but there were not many left by that
time . so ended the attempt to retake moria ! it was valiant but foolish . the
time is not come yet . now [???] i fear [???] we must say farewell to balin son of
[???] . here he must lie in the halls of his fathers . we will take this
book [???] the book of [???] [???] and look at it more closely later . you had
better keep it [???] [???] [???] and take it back to [???] [???] if you get a chance . it
will interest him [???] though it will grieve him deeply . come [???] let us go ! the
morning is passing . '
' which way shall we go ? ' asked [???] .
' back to the hall [???] ' answered [???] . ' but our visit to this room has
not been in vain . i now know where we are . this must be [???] as [???] says [???] the
chamber of [???] ; and the hall must be the twenty - first of the north - end .
therefore we should leave by the eastern arch of the hall [???] and bear right
and south [???] and go downwards . the twenty - first hall should be on the seventh
level [???] that is six above the level of the gates . come now ! back to the hall !
'
[???] had hardly spoken these words [???] when there came a great noise : a
rolling boom that seemed to come from depths far below [???] and to tremble in
the stone at their feet . they sprang towards the door in alarm . doom [???] doom
it rolled again [???] as if huge hands were turning the very [???] of moria
into a vast drum . then there came an echoing blast : a great horn was blown
in the hall [???] and answering horns and harsh cries were heard further off .
there was a hurrying sound of many feet .
` they are coming ! ' cried legolas .
' we cannot get out [???] ' said [???] .
` trapped ! ' cried [???] . ` why did i delay ? here we are [???] caught [???] just
as they were before . but i was not here then . we will see what - - - - '
doom [???] doom came the drum - beat and the walls shook .
' slam the doors and wedge them ! ' shouted [???] . ' and keep your packs
on as long as you can : we may get a chance to cut our way out yet . '
` no ! ' said [???] . ' we must not get shut in . keep the east door ajar !
we will go that way [???] if we get a chance . '

another harsh horn - call and shrill cries rang out . feet were coming
down the corridor . there was a ring and clatter as the company drew their
swords . [???] shone with a pale light [???] and sting glinted at the edges .
[???] set his shoulder against the western door .
` wait a moment ! do not close it yet ! ' said [???] . he sprang forward
to [???] ' s side and drew himself up to his full height .
' who comes hither to disturb the rest of balin lord of moria ? ' he
cried in a loud voice .
there was a rush of hoarse laughter [???] like the fall of sliding stones
into a pit ; amid the clamour a deep voice was raised in command . doom [???]
boom [???]
doom went the drums in the deep .
with a quick movement [???] stepped before the narrow opening of the
door and thrust forward his staff : there was a [???] flash that lit the
chamber and the passage outside . for an instant the [???] looked out .
arrows whined and whistled down the corridor as he sprang back .
' there are [???] [???] very many of them [???] ' he said . ` and some are large and
evil : black [???] of [???] . for the moment they are hanging back [???] but there
is something else there . a great cave - troll [???] i think [???] or more than one .
there is no hope of escape that way . '
' and no hope at all [???] if they come at the other door as well [???] ' said
[???] .
' there is no sound outside here yet [???] ' said [???] [???] who was standing by
the eastern door listening . ` the passage on this side [???] straight down
a stair : it plainly does not lead back towards the hall . but it is no good
flying blindly this way with the pursuit just behind . we cannot block the
door . its key is gone and the lock is broken [???] and it opens inwards . we must
do something to delay the enemy first . we will make them fear the chamber of
[???] ! ' he said grimly feeling the edge of his sword [???] and [???] ril .
heavy feet were heard in the corridor . [???] flung himself against
the door and heaved it to ; then he wedged it with broken sword - blades and
[???] of wood . the company retreated to the other side of the chamber .
but they had no chance to fly yet . there was a b low on the door that made it
quiver ; and then it began to grind slowly open [???] driving back the wedges . a
huge arm and shoulder [???] with a dark skin of greenish scales [???] was thrust
through the widening gap . then a great [???] flat [???] toeless foot was for ced
through below . there was a dead silence outside .

[???] leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all his might ; but his
sword rang [???] glanced aside [???] and fell from his shaken hand . the blade was
notched .
suddenly [???] and to his own surprise [???] [???] felt a hot wrath blaze up in
his heart . ` the shire ! ' he cried [???] and springing beside [???] [???] he stooped [???]
and stabbed with sting at the hideous foot . there was a bellow [???] and the foot
jerked back [???] nearly wrenching sting from [???] ' s arm . black dr ops dripped
from the blade and smoked on the floor . [???] hurled himself against the
door and [???] it again .
` one for the shire ! ' cried [???] . ` the hobbit ' s bite is deep ! you
have a good blade [???] [???] son of drogo ! '
there was a crash on the door [???] followed by crash after crash . rams and
hammers were beating against it . it cracked and [???] back [???] and the
opening grew suddenly wide . arrows came whistling in [???] but struck the
northern wall [???] and fell harmlessly to the floor . there was a horn - blast and
a rush of feet [???] and [???] one after another leaped into the chamber .
how many there were the company could not count . the affray was sharp [???]
but the [???] were dismayed by the fierceness of the defence . legolas shot
two through the throat . [???] hewed the legs from under another that had
sprung up on balin ' s tomb . [???] and [???] slew many . when thirteen
had
fallen the rest fled shrieking . leaving the defenders [???] [???] except for
sam who had a scratch along the scalp . a quick duck had saved him ; and he
had felled his orc : a [???] thrust with his barrow - blade . a fire was
[???] in his brown eyes that would have made ted sandyman step
backwards [???] if he had seen it .
` now is the time ! ' cried [???] . ` let us go [???] before the troll
returns ! '
but even as they retreated [???] and before [???] and merry had reached the
stair outside [???] a huge orc - chieftain [???] almost man - high [???] clad in black mail
from head to foot [???] leaped into the chamber ; behind him his followers
[???] in the doorway . his broad flat face was swart [???] his eyes were like
coals [???] and his tongue was red ; he [???] a great spear . with a thrust of
his huge hide shield he turned [???] ' s sword and bore him backwards [???]
throwing him to the ground . diving under [???] ' s blow with the speed of a
striking snake he charged into the company and thrust with his spear
straight at [???] . the blow caught him on the right side [???] and [???] was

hurled against the wall and pinned . sam [???] with a cry [???] hacked at the
spear - shaft [???] and it broke . but even as the orc flung down the truncheon and
swept out his [???] [???] and [???] ril came down upon his helm . there was a flash
like flame and the helm burst asunder . the orc fell with cloven head . his
followers fled howling [???] as [???] and [???] sprang at them .
doom [???] doom went the drums in the deep . the great voice rolled out
again .
' now ! ' shouted [???] . ' now is the last chance . run for it ! '
[???] picked up [???] where he lay by the wall and made for the
stair [???] pushing merry and [???] in front of him . the others followed ; but
[???] had to be dragged away by legolas : in spite of the peril he lingered
by balin ' s tomb with his head bowed . [???] hauled the eastern door to [???]
grinding upon its [???] : it had great iron rings on either side [???] but could
not be fastened .
' i am all right [???] ' gasped [???] . ` i can walk . put me down ! '
[???] nearly dropped him in his amazement . ' i thought you were dead !
' he cried .
' not yet ! ' said [???] . ' but there is time for wonder . off you go [???]
all of you [???] down the stairs ! wait a few minutes for me at the bottom [???] but if
i do not come soon [???] go on ! go quickly and choose paths leading right and
downwards . '
' we cannot leave you to hold the door alone ! ' said [???] .
` do as i say ! ' said [???] fiercely . ` swords are no more use here .
go ! '
the passage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark . they groped their
way down a long flight of steps [???] and then looked back ; but they could see
nothing [???] except high above them the faint glimmer of the [???] ' s staff . he
seemed to be still standing on guard by the closed door . [???] breathed
heavily and leaned aga inst sam [???] who put his arms about him . they stood
peering up the stairs into the darkness . [???] thought he could hear the
voice of [???] above [???] muttering words that ran down the [???] roof with
a sighing echo . he could not catch what was said . the walls seemed to be
trembling . every now and again the drum - beats [???] and rolled : doom [???]
doom .
suddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of white light . then
there was a dull rumble and a heavy thud . the drum - beats broke out wildly :

doom - boom [???] doom - boom [???] and then stopped . [???] came flying down the
steps
and fell to the ground in the midst of the company .
` well [???] well ! that ' s over ! ' said the [???] struggling to his feet . ` i
have done all that i could . but i have met my match [???] and have nearly been
destroyed . but don ' t stand here ! go on ! you will have to do without light
for a while : i am rather shaken . go on ! go on ! where are you [???] [???] ? come
ahead with me ! keep close behind [???] all of you ! '
they [???] a fter him wondering what had happened . doom [???] doom
went
the drum - beats again : they now sounded muffled and far away [???] but they were
following . there was no other sound of pursuit [???] neither tramp of feet [???] nor
any voice . [???] took no turns [???] right or left [???] for the passage seemed to
be going in the direction that he desired . every now and again it descended
a flight of steps [???] fifty or more [???] to a lower level . at the moment that was
their chief danger ; for in the dark they could not see a descent [???] until they
came on it [???] and put their feet out into emptiness . [???] felt the ground
with his staff like a blind man .
at the end of an hour they had gone a mile [???] or maybe a little more [???] and
had descended many flights of stairs . there was still no sound of pursuit .
almost they began to hope that they would escape . at the bottom of the
seventh flight [???] halted .
` it is getting hot ! ' he gasped . ` we ought to be down at least to the
level of the gates now . soon i think we should look for a left - hand turn to
take us east . i hope it is not far . i am very weary . i must rest here a
moment [???] even if all the [???] ever [???] are after us . '
[???] took his arm and helped him down to a seat on the step . ` what
happened away up there a t the door ? ' he asked . ` did you meet the beater of
the drums ? '
' i do not know [???] ' answered [???] . ` but i found myself suddenly faced
by something that i have not met before . i could think of nothing to do but
to try and put a shutting - spell on the door . i know many ; but to do things
of that kind rightly requires time [???] and even then the door can be broken by
strength .
` as i stood there i could hear orc - voices on the other side : at any
moment i thought they would burst it open . i could not hear what was said ;
they seemed to be talking in their own hideous language . all i caught was

[???] ; that is [???] fire [???] . then something came into the chamber - - i felt it
through the door [???] and the [???] themselves were afraid and fell silent . it
laid hold of the iron ring [???] and then it perceived me and my spell .
' what it was i cannot guess [???] but i have never felt such a challenge .
the counter - spell was terrible . it nearly broke me . for an instant the door
left my control and began to open ! i had to speak a word of command . that
proved too great a strain . the door burst in pieces . something dark as a
cloud was blocking out all the light inside [???] and i was thrown backwards down
the stairs . all the wall gave way [???] and the roof of the chamber as well [???] i
think .
` i am afraid balin is buried deep [???] and maybe something else is buried
there too . i cannot say . but at least the passage behind us was completely
blocked . ah ! i have never felt so spent [???] but it is passing . and now what
about you [???] [???] ? there was not time to say so [???] but i have never been more
delighted in my life than when you spoke . i feared that it was a brave but
dead hobbit that [???] was carrying . '
` what about me ? ' said [???] . ' i am alive [???] and whole i think . i am
bruised and in pain [???] but it is not too bad . '
` well [???] ' said [???] [???] ` i can only say that [???] are made of a stuff
so tough that i have never met the like of it . had i known [???] i would have
spoken softer in the inn at bree ! that spear - thrust would have [???] a
wild boar ! '
' well [???] it did not [???] me [???] i am glad to say [???] ' said [???] ; ` though i
feel as if i had been caught between a hammer and an anvil . ' he said no
more . he found breathing painful .
' you take after [???] [???] ' said [???] . ` there is more about you than
meets the eye [???] as i said of him long ago . ' [???] wondered if the remark
meant more than it said .
they now went on again . before long [???] spoke . he had keen eyes in
the dark . ` i think [???] ' he said [???] ` that there is a light ahead . but it is not
daylight . it is red . what can it be ? '
` [???] ! ' muttered [???] . ` i wonder if that is what they meant : that
the lower levels are on fire ? still [???] we can only go on . '
soon the light became [???] [???] and could be seen by all . it was
[???] and glowing on the walls away down the passage before them . they
could now see their way : in front the road [???] down swiftly [???] and some way
ahead there stood a low archway ; through it the glowing light came . the air

became very hot .
when they came to the arch [???] went through [???] signing to them to
wait . as he stood just beyond the opening they saw his face lit by a red
glow . quickly he stepped back .
` there is some new devi lry here [???] ' he said [???] ' devised for our welcome no
doubt . but i know now where we are : we have reached the first deep [???] the
level immediately below the gates . this is the second hall of old moria ; and
the gates are near : away beyond the eastern end [???] on the left [???] not more than
a quarter of a mile . across the bridge [???] up a broad stair [???] along a wide road
through the first hall [???] and out ! but come and look ! '
they peered out . before them was another [???] hall . it was [???]
and far longer than the one in which they had slept . they were near its
eastern end ; westward it ran away into darkness . down the centre stalked a
double line of towering pillars . they were carved like boles of mighty trees
whose boughs [???] the roof with a branching tracery of stone . their stems
were smooth and black [???] but a red glow was darkly mirrored in their sides .
right across the floor [???] close to the feet of two huge pillars a great
[???] had opened . out of it a fierce red light came [???] and now and aga in
flames licked at the brink and curled about the bases of the [???] . wisps
of dark smoke wavered in the hot air .
' if we had come by the main road down from the upper halls [???] we should
have been trapped here [???] ' said [???] . ` let us hope that the fire now lies
between us and pursuit . come ! there is no time to lose . '
even as he spoke they heard again the pursuing drum - beat : doom [???] doom [???]
doom . away beyond the shadows at the western end of the hall there came
cries and horn - calls . doom [???] doom : the pillars seemed to tremble and the
flames to quiver .
` now for the last race ! ' said [???] . ' if the sun is shining outside
we may still escape . after me ! '
he turned left and sped across the smooth floor of the hall . the
distance was greater than it had looked . as they ran they heard the beat and
echo of many hurrying feet behind . a shrill yell went up : they had been
seen . there was a ring and clash of steel . an arrow whistled over [???] ' s
head .
[???] laughed . ` they did not expect this [???] ' he said . ` the fire has cut
them off . we are on the wrong side ! '
` look ahead ! ' called [???] . ` the bridge is near . it is dangerous and

narrow . '
suddenly [???] saw before him a black chasm . at the end of the hall the
floor vanished and fell to an unknown depth . the outer door could only be
reached by a slender bridge of stone [???] without [???] or rail [???] that spanned the
chasm with one curving spring of fifty feet . it was an ancient defence of
the [???] against any enemy that might capture the first hall and the
outer passages . they could only pass across it in single file . at the brink
[???] halted and the others came up in a pack behind .
' lead the way [???] [???] ! ' he said . ' [???] and merry next . straight on
and up the stair beyond the door ! '
arrows fell among them . one struck [???] and sprang back . another
pierced [???] ' s hat and stuck there like a black feather . [???] looked
behind . beyond the fire he saw swarming black figures : there seemed to be
hundreds of [???] . they brandished spears and [???] which shone red as
blood in the firelight . doom [???] doom rolled the drum - beats [???] growing louder and
louder [???] doom [???] doom .
legolas turned and set an arrow to the string [???] though it was a long
shot for his small bow . he drew [???] but his hand fell [???] and the arrow slipped to
the ground . he gave a cry of dismay and fear . two great [???] appeared ;
they bore great [???] of stone [???] and flung them down to serve as [???]
over the fire . but it was not the [???] that had filled the elf with
terror . the ranks of the [???] had opened [???] and they crowded away [???] as if they
themselves were afraid . something was coming up behind them . what it was
could not be seen : it was like a grea t shadow [???] in the middle of which was a
dark form [???] of man - shape maybe [???] yet greater ; and a power and terror seemed to
be in it and to go before it .
it came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a cloud had
bent over it . then with a rush it leaped across the [???] . the flames
roared up to greet it [???] and wreathed about it ; and a black smoke [???] in
the air . its streaming mane kindled [???] and blazed behind it . in its right hand
was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire ; in its left it held a whip of
many [???] .
' ai ! ai ! ' wailed legolas . ' a balrog ! a balrog is come ! '
[???] stared with wide eyes . ` durin ' s bane ! ' he cried [???] and letting his
axe fall he covered his face .
' a balrog [???] ' muttered [???] . ` now i understand . ' he faltered and
leaned heavily on his staff . ` what an evil fortune ! and i am already weary . '

the dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them . the [???] yelled
and poured over the stone [???] . then [???] raised his horn and blew .
loud the challenge rang and bellowed [???] like the shout of many throats under
the [???] roof . for a moment the [???] [???] and the fiery shadow
halted . then the echoes died as suddenly as a flame blown out by a dark
wind [???] and the enemy advanced again .
' over the bridge ! ' cried [???] [???] recalling his strength . ` fly ! this is
a foe beyond any of you . i must hold the narrow way . fly ! ' [???] and
[???] did not heed the command [???] but still held their ground [???] side by side [???]
behind [???] a t the far end of the bridge . the others halted just within
the doorway at the hall ' s end [???] and turned [???] unable to leave their leader to
face the enemy alone .
the balrog reached the bridge . [???] stood in the middle of the span [???]
leaning on the sta ff in his left hand [???] but in his other hand [???]
gleamed [???] cold and white . his enemy halted again [???] facing him [???] and the shadow
about it reached out like two vast wings . it raised the whip [???] and the [???]
whined and cracked . fire came from its [???] . but [???] stood firm .
` you cannot pass [???] ' he said . the [???] stood still [???] and a dead silence
fell . ` i am a servant of the secret fire [???] [???] of the flame of anor . you
cannot pass . the dark fire will not avail you [???] flame of [???] . go back to the
shadow ! you cannot pass . '
the balrog made no answer . the fire in it seemed to die [???] but the
darkness grew . it stepped forward slowly on to the bridge [???] and suddenly it
drew itself up to a great height [???] and its wings were spread from wall to
wall ; but still [???] could be seen [???] [???] in the gloom ; he seemed
small [???] and altogether alone : grey and bent [???] like a [???] tree before the
onset of a storm .
from out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming .
[???] glittered white in answer .
there was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire . the balrog fell
back and its sword flew up in [???] fragments . the [???] swayed on the
bridge [???] stepped back a pace [???] and then again stood still .
' you cannot pass ! ' he said .
with a bound the balrog leaped full upon the bridge . its whip whirled
and [???] .
' he cannot stand alone ! ' cried [???] suddenly and ran back along the
bridge . ' [???] ! ' he shouted . ' i am with you [???] [???] ! '

` [???] ! ' cried [???] and leaped after him .
at that moment [???] lifted his staff [???] and crying aloud he smote the
bridge before him . the staff broke asunder and fell from his hand . a
blinding sheet of white flame sprang up . the bridge cracked . right at the
balrog ' s feet it broke [???] and the stone upon which it stood [???] into the
gulf [???] while the rest remained [???] poised [???] [???] like a tongue of rock
thrust out into emptiness .
with a terrible cry the balrog fell forward [???] and its shadow plu nged
down and vanished . but even as it fell it swung its whip [???] and the [???]
[???] and curled about the [???] ' s knees [???] dragging him to the brink . he
[???] and fell [???] grasped vainly at the stone [???] and slid into the [???] .
' fly [???] you fools ! ' he cried [???] and was gone .
the fires went out [???] and blank darkness fell . the company stood rooted
with horror staring into the pit . even as [???] and [???] came flying
back [???] the rest of the bridge cracked and fell . with a cry [???] roused
them .
' come ! i will lead you now ! ' he called . ' we must obey his last
command . follow me ! '
they [???] wildly up the great stairs beyond the door . [???]
leading [???] [???] at the rear . at the top was a wide echoing passage . along
this they fled . [???] heard sam at his side weeping [???] and then he found that
he himself was weeping as he ran . doom [???] doom [???] doom the drum - beats rolled
behind [???] mournful now and slow ; doom !
they ran on . the light grew before them ; great shafts pierced the roof .
they ran swifter . they passed into a hall [???] bright with daylight from its
high windows in the east . they fled across it . through its huge broken doors
they passed [???] and suddenly before them the great gates opened [???] an arch of
blazing ligh t .
there was a guard of [???] [???] in the shadows behind the great
door posts towering on either side [???] but the gates were [???] and cast
down . [???] smote to the ground the captain that stood in his path [???] and
the rest fled in terror of his wrath . the company swept past them and took
no heed of them . out of the gates they ran and sprang down the huge and
age - worn steps [???] the [???] of moria .
thus [???] at last [???] they came beyond hope under the sky and felt the wind on
their faces .
they did not halt until they were out of [???] from the walls .

[???] dale lay about them . the shadow of the misty mountains lay upon it [???]
but eastwards there was a golden light on the land . it was but one hour
after noon . the sun was shining ; the clouds were white and high .
they looked back . dark yawned the archway of the gates under the
mountain - shadow . faint and far beneath the earth rolled the slow drum - beats :
doom . a thin black smoke trailed out . nothing else was to be seen ; the dale
all around was empty . doom . grief at last wholly overcame them [???] and they
wept long : some standing and silent [???] some cast upon the ground . doom [???] doom .
the drum - beats faded .




chapter 6 . [???]



' alas ! i fear we cannot stay here longer [???] ' said [???] . he looked
towards the mountains and held up his sword . ` farewell [???] [???] ! ' he cried .
' did i not say to you : if you pass the doors of moria [???] beware ? alas that i
spoke true ! what hope have we without you ? '
he turned to the company . ` we must do without hope [???] ' he said . ` at least
we may yet be avenged . let us gird ourselves and weep no more ! come ! we
have
a long road [???] and much to do . '
they rose and looked about them . northward the dale ran up into a glen
of shadows between two great arms of the mountains [???] above which three white
peaks were shining : [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] . the mountains of moria .
at the head of the glen a torrent flowed like a white lace over an endless
ladder of short falls [???] and a mist of foam hung in the air about the
mountains ' feet .
` yonder is the [???] stair [???] ' said [???] [???] pointing to the falls .
' down the deep - cloven way that climbs beside the torrent we should have
come [???] if fortune had been kinder . '
` or [???] less cruel [???] ' said [???] . ` there he stands smiling in the
sun ! ' he shook his fist at the furthest of the snow - capped peaks and turned
away .
to the east the [???] arm of the mountains marched to a sudden end [???]
and far lands could be descried beyond them [???] wide and vague . to the south
the misty mountains receded endlessly as far as sight could reach . less than
a mile away [???] and a little below them [???] for they still stood high up on the
west side of the dale [???] there lay a mere . it was long and oval [???] shaped like a
great spear - head thrust deep into the northern glen ; but its southern end
was beyond the shadows under the [???] sky . yet its waters were dark : a
deep blue like clear evening sky seen from a lamp - lit room . its face was
still and [???] . about it lay a smooth sward [???] shelving down on all sides
to its bare [???] rim .
` there lies the [???] [???] deep [???] - [???] ! ' said [???] sadly . ` i
remember that he said : [???] may you have joy of the sight ! but we cannot linger
there . [???] now long shall i journey ere i have joy again . it is i that must

hasten away [???] and he that must remain . '
the company now went down the road from the gates . it was rough and
broken [???] fading to a winding track between heather and whin that thrust amid
the cracking stones . but still it could be seen that once long ago a great
paved way had wound upwards from the [???] of the dwarf - kingdom .
in
places there were ruined works of stone beside the path [???] and mounds of green
topped with slender birches [???] or fir - trees sighing in the wind . an eastward
bend led them hard by the sward of [???] [???] and there not far from the
roadside stood a single column broken at the top .
' that is durin ' s stone ! ' cried [???] . ` i cannot pass without turning
aside for a moment to look at the wonder of the dale ! '
` be swift then ! ' said [???] [???] looking back towards the gates . ` the
sun sinks early . the [???] will not [???] maybe [???] come out till after [???] [???] but we
must be far away before nightfall . the moon is almost spent [???] and it will be
dark tonight . '
' come with me [???] [???] ! ' cried the dwarf [???] springing from the road . ` i
would not have you go without seeing [???] - [???] . ' he ran down the long
green slope . [???] followed slowly [???] drawn by the still blue water in spite
of hurt and weariness ; sam came up behind .
beside the standing stone [???] halted and looked up . it was cracked
and weather - worn [???] and the faint runes upon its side could not be read . ` this
pillar marks the spot where durin first looked in the [???] [???] ' said the
dwarf . ' let us look ourselves once [???] ere we go ! '
they stooped over the dark water . at first they could see nothing . then
slowly they saw the forms of the [???] mountains mirrored in a profou nd
blue [???] and the peaks were like plumes of white flame above them ; beyond there
was a space of sky . there like jewels sunk in the deep shone [???] stars [???]
though sunlight was in the sky above . of their own stooping forms no shadow
could be seen .
' o [???] - [???] fair and wonderful ! ' said [???] . ` there lies the crown
of durin till he wakes . farewell ! ' he bowed [???] and turned away [???] and hastened
back up the green - sward to the road again .
` what did you see ? ' said [???] to sam [???] but sam was too deep in
thought to answer .
the road now turned south and went quickly downwards [???] running out from
between the arms of the dale . some way below the mere they came on a deep

well of water [???] clear as crystal [???] from which a freshet fell over a stone lip
and ran [???] and [???] down a steep rocky channel .
' here is the spring from which the [???] rises . ' said [???] . ` do
not drink of it ! it is icy cold . '
' soon it becomes a swift river [???] and it gathers water from many other
mountain - streams [???] ' said [???] . ` our road leads beside it for many miles .
for i shall take you by the road that [???] chose [???] and first i hope to
come to the woods where the [???] flows into the great river - out
yonder . ' they looked as he pointed [???] and before them they could see the
stream leaping down to the trough of the valley [???] and then running on and
away into the lower lands [???] until it was lost in a golden haze .
` there lie the woods of [???] ! ' said legolas . ` that is the
fairest of all the dwellings of my people . there are no trees like the trees
of that land . for in the autumn their leaves fall not [???] but turn to gold . not
till the spring comes and the new green opens do they fall [???] and then the
boughs are laden with yellow flowers ; and the floor of the wood is golden [???]
and golden is the roof [???] and its pillars are of silver [???] for the bark of the
trees is smooth and grey . so still our songs in [???] say . my heart would
be glad if i were beneath the eaves of that wood [???] and it were [???] ! '
` my heart will be glad [???] even in the winter [???] ' said [???] . ' but it lies
many miles away . let us hasten ! '
for some time [???] and sam managed to keep up with the others ; but
[???] was leading them at a great pace [???] and after a while they lagged
behind . they had eaten nothing since the early morning . sam ' s cut was
burning like fire [???] and his head felt light . in spite of the shining sun the
wind seemed chill after the warm darkness of moria . he shivered . [???] felt
every step more painful and he gasped for breath .
at last legolas turned [???] and seeing them now far behind [???] he spoke to
[???] . the others halted [???] and [???] ran back [???] calling to [???] to come
with him .
' i am sorry [???] [???] ! ' he cried [???] full of concern . ` so much has happened
this day and we have such need of haste [???] that i have forgotten that you were
hurt ; and sam too . you should have spoken . we have done nothing to ease
you [???]
as we ought [???] though all the [???] of moria were after us . come now ! a little
further on there is a place where we can rest for a little . there i will do
what i can for you . come [???] [???] ! we will carry them . '

soon afterwards they came upon another stream that ran down from the
west [???] and joined its [???] water with the hurrying [???] . together
they [???] over a fall of green - hued stone [???] and foamed down into a dell .
about it stood fir - trees [???] short and bent [???] and its sides were steep and
clothed with harts - tongue and [???] of [???] - berry . at the bottom there
was a level space through which the stream flowed noisily over shining
[???] . here they rested . it was now nearly three hours after noon [???] and
they had come only a few miles from the gates . already the sun was
westering .
while [???] and the two younger [???] kindled a fire of brush - and
fir - wood [???] and drew water [???] [???] tended sam and [???] . sam ' s wound was
not
deep [???] but it looked ugly [???] and [???] ' s face was grave as he examined it .
after a moment he looked up with relief .
' good luck [???] sam ! ' he said . ' many have received worse than this in
payment for the slaying of their first orc . the cut is not poisoned [???] as the
wounds of orc - blades too often are . it should heal well when i have tended
it . bathe it when [???] has heated water . '
he opened his pouch and drew out some withered leaves . ` they are dry
and some of their virtue has one [???] he said [???] but here i have still some of the
leaves of [???] that i gathered near weather top . crush one in the water [???]
and wash the wound clean [???] and i will bind it . now it is your turn . [???] ! '
' i am all right [???] ' said [???] [???] [???] to have his garments touched .
` aii i needed was some food and a little rest . '
` no ! ' said [???] . ` we must have a look and see what the hammer and
the anvil have done to you . i still marvel that you are alive at all . '
gently he stripped off [???] ' s old jacket and worn tunic [???] and gave a gasp of
wonder . then he laughed . the silver [???] [???] before his eyes like
the light upon a [???] sea . carefully he took it off and held it up [???] and
the gems on it glittered like stars . and the sound of the shaken rings was
like the tinkle of rain in a pool .
` look [???] my friends ! ' he called . ` h ere ' s a pretty hobbit - skin to wrap an
elven - princeling in ! if it were known that [???] had such hides [???] all the
hunters of middle - earth would be riding to the shire . '
` and all the arrows of all the hunters in the world would be in vain [???] '
said [???] [???] gazing at the mail in wonder . ` it is a [???] - coat . [???] ! i
have never seen or heard tell of one so fair . is this the coat that [???]

spoke of ? then he [???] it . but it was well given ! '
` i have often wondered what you and [???] wer e doing [???] so close in his
little room [???] ' said merry . ' bless the old hobbit ! i love him more than ever .
i hope we get a chance of telling him about it ! '
there was a dark and blackened bruise on [???] ' s right side and breast .
under the mail there was a shirt of soft leather [???] but at one point the rings
had been driven through it into the flesh . [???] ' s left side also was scored
and bruised where he had been hurled against the wall . while the others set
the food ready . [???] bathed the hurts with wa ter in which [???] was
steeped . the [???] fragrance filled the dell [???] and all those who stooped
over the steaming water felt refreshed and strengthened . soon [???] felt the
pain leave him [???] and his breath grew easy : though he was stiff and sore to
the touch for many days . [???] bound some soft pads of cloth at his side .
` the mail is marvellously light [???] ' he said . ` put it on again [???] if you can
bear it . my heart is glad to know that you have such a coat . do not lay it
aside [???] even in sleep [???] unless fortune brings you where you are safe for a
while ; and that will seldom chance while your quest lasts . '
when they had eaten [???] the company got ready to go on . they put out the
fire and hid all traces of it . then climbing out of the dell they took to
the road again . they had not gone far before the sun sank behind the
westward heights and great shadows crept down the mountain - sides . [???]
veiled their feet [???] and mist rose in the hollows . away in the east the
evening light lay pale upon the dim lands of distant plain and wood . sam and
[???] now feeling eased and greatly refreshed were able to go at a fair
pace [???] and with only one brief halt [???] led the company on for nearly
three more hours .
it was dark . deep night had fallen . there were many clear stars [???] hut
the fast - waning moon would not be seen till late . [???] and [???] were at
the rear [???] walking softly and not speaking [???] listening for any sound upon the
road behind . at length [???] broke the silence .
' not a sound but the wind [???] ' he said . ` there are no [???] near [???] or my
ears are made of wood . it is to be hoped that the [???] will be content with
driving us from moria . and maybe that was all their purpose [???] and they had
nothing else to do with u s - with the ring . though [???] will often pursue foes
for many leagues into the plain [???] if they have a fallen captain to avenge . '
[???] did not answer . he looked at sting [???] and the blade was dull . yet
he had heard something [???] or thought he had . as soon a s the shadows had fallen

about them and the road behind was dim [???] he had heard again the quick patter
of feet . even now he heard it . he turned swiftly . there were two tiny gleams
of light behind [???] or for a moment he thought he saw them [???] but at once they
slipped aside and vanished .
` what is it ? ' said the dwarf .
` i don ' t know . ' answered [???] . ' i thought i heard feet [???] and i thought
i saw a light - like eyes . i have thought so often [???] since we first entered
moria . '
[???] halted and stooped to the ground . ' i hear nothing but the
night - speech of plant and stone [???] ' he said . ' come ! let us hurry ! the others
are out of sight . '
the night - wind blew chill up the valley to meet them . before them a
wide grey shadow loomed [???] and they heard an endless rustle of leaves like
[???] in the breeze .
` [???] ! ' cried legolas . ' [???] ! we have come to the eaves of
the golden wood . alas that it is winter ! '
under the night the trees stood tall before them [???] arched over the road
and stream that ran suddenly beneath their spreading boughs . in the dim
light of the stars their stems were grey [???] and their [???] leaves a hint
of fallow gold .
' [???] ! ' said [???] . ' glad i am to hear again the wind in the
trees ! we are still little more than five leagues from the gates [???] but we can
go no further . here let us hope that the virtue of the elves will keep us
tonight from the peril that comes behind . '
` if elves indeed still dwell here in the darkening world [???] ' said [???] .
' it is long since any of my own folk journeyed hither back to the land
whence we wandered in ages long ago [???] ' said legolas [???] ' but we hear that [???]
is not yet deserted [???] for there is a secret power here that holds evil from
the land . nevertheless its folk are seldom seen [???] and maybe they dwell now
deep in the woods and far from the northern border . '
' indeed deep in the wood they dwell [???] ' said [???] [???] and sighed as if
some memory stirred in him . ` we must fend for ourselves tonight . we will go
forward a short way [???] until the trees are all about us [???] and then we will turn
aside from the path and seek a place to rest in . '
he stepped forward ; but [???] stood irresolute and did not follow .
' is there no other way ? ' he said .
` what other fairer way would you desire ? ' said [???] .

` a plain road [???] though it led through a hedge of swords [???] ' said [???] .
` by strange paths has this company been led [???] and so far to evil fortune .
against my will we passed under the shades of moria [???] to our loss . and now we
must enter the golden wood [???] you say . but of that perilous land we have heard
in [???] [???] and it is said that few come out who once go in ; and of that few
none have escaped [???] . '
` say not [???] [???] but if you say unchanged [???] then maybe you will speak
the truth said [???] . but lore wanes in [???] [???] [???] [???] if in the city of
those who once were wise they now speak evil of [???] . believe what you
will [???] there is no other way for us - - unless you would go back to
moria - gate [???] or scale the pathless mountains [???] or swim the great river all
alone . '
` then lead on ! ' said [???] . ` but it is perilous . '
` perilous indeed [???] ' said [???] [???] ' fair and perilous ; but only evil need
fear it [???] or those who bring some evil with them . follow me ! '
they had gone little more than a mile into the forest when they came
upon another stream flowing down swiftly from the tree - clad [???] that
climbed back westward towards the mountains . they heard it [???] over a
fall away among the shadows on their right . its dark hurrying waters ran
across the path before them [???] and joined the [???] in a [???] of dim
[???] among the roots of trees .
` here is [???] ! ' said legolas . ' of this stream the silvan elves
made many songs long ago [???] and still we sing them in the north [???] remembering
the [???] on its falls [???] and the golden flowers that floated in its foam .
all is dark now and the bridge of [???] is broken down . i will bathe my
feet [???] for it is said that the water is healing to the weary . ' he went
forward and climbed down the deep - cloven bank and stepped into the stream .
` follow me ! ' he cried . ' the water is not deep . let us wade across ! on
the further bank we can rest . and the sound of the falling water may bring
us sleep and forgetfulness of grief . '
one by one they climbed down and followed legolas . for a moment [???]
stood near the brink and let the water flow over his tired feet . it was cold
but its touch was clean [???] and as he went on and it mounted to his knees [???] he
felt that the stain of travel and all weariness was washed from his limbs .
when all the company had crossed [???] they sat and rested and ate a little
food ; and legolas told them tales of [???] that the elves of [???]
still kept in their hearts [???] of sunlight and starlight upon the [???] by

the great river before the world was grey .
at length a silence fell [???] and they heard the music of the waterfall
running sweetly in the shadows . almost [???] fancied that he could hear a
voice singing [???] mingled with the sound of the water .
` do you hear the voice of [???] ? ' asked legolas . ' i will sing you a
song of the maiden [???] [???] who bore the same name as the stream besi de
which she lived lung ago . it is a fair song in our woodland tongue ; but this
is how it runs in the westron speech [???] as some in [???] now sing it . ' in
a soft voice hardly to be heard amid the rustle of the leaves above them he
began :
an elven - maid there was of old [???]
a shining star by day :
her mantle white was hemmed with gold [???]
her shoes of silver - grey .

a star was bound upon her brows [???]
a light was on her hair
as sun upon the golden boughs
in [???] the fair .

her hair was long [???] her limbs were white [???]
and fair she was and free ;
and in the wind she went as light
as leaf of linden - tree .

beside the falls of [???] [???]
by water clear and cool [???]
her voice as falling silver fell
into the shining pool .

where now she wanders none can tell [???]
in sunlight or in shade ;
for lost of yore was [???]
and in the mountains strayed .

the elven - ship in haven grey
beneath the mountain - lee

[???] her for many a day
beside the roaring sea .

a wind by night in northern lands
arose [???] and loud it cried [???]
and drove the ship from elven - [???]
across the streaming tide .

when dawn came dim the land was lost [???]
the mountains sinking grey
beyond the heaving waves that tossed
their plumes of blinding spray .

amroth beheld the fading shore
now low beyond the swell [???]
and cursed the faithless ship that bore
him far from [???] .

of old he was an elven - king [???]
a lord of tree and glen [???]
when golden were the boughs in spring
in fair [???] .

from helm to sea they saw him leap [???]
as arrow from the string [???]
and dive into the water deep [???]
as mew upon the wing .

the wind was in his flowing hair [???]
the foam about him shone ;
afar they saw him strong and fair
go riding like a swan .

but from the west has come no word [???]
and on the hither shore
no tidings elven - folk have heard
of amroth evermore .

the voice of legolas faltered [???] and the song ceased . ' i cannot sing any
more [???] ' he said . ' that is but a part [???] for i have forgotten much . it is long
and sad [???] for it tells how sorrow came upon [???] [???] [???] of the
blossom [???] when the [???] awakened evil in the mountains . '
` but the [???] did not make the evil [???] ' said [???] .
` i said not so ; yet evil came [???] ' answered legolas sadly . ` then many of
the elves of [???] ' s kindred left their dwellings and departed and she
was lost far in the south [???] in the passes of the white mountains ; and she
came not to the ship where amroth her lover waited for her . but in the
spring when the wind is in the new leaves the echo of her voice may still be
heard by the falls that bear her name . and when the wind is in the south the
voice of amroth comes up from the sea ; for [???] flows into [???] [???]
that elves call celebrant [???] and celebrant into [???] the great . and [???]
flows into the bay of [???] whence the elves of [???] set sa il . but
neither [???] nor amroth ever came back .
' it is told that she had a house built in the branches of a tree that
grew near the falls ; for that was the custom of the elves of [???] [???] to
dwell in the trees [???] and maybe it is so still . ther efore they were called the
[???] [???] the tree - people . deep in their forest the trees are very great .
the people of the woods did not delve in the ground like [???] [???] nor build
strong places of stone before the shadow came . '
` and even in these la tter days dwelling in the trees might be thought
safer than sitting on the ground [???] ' said [???] . he looked across the stream
to the road that led back to [???] dale [???] and then up into the roof of dark
boughs above .
` your words bring good counsel [???] [???] [???] ' said [???] . ` we cannot build
a house [???] but tonight we will do as the [???] and seek [???] in the
tree - tops [???] if we can . we have sat here beside the road already longer than
was wise . '
the company now turned aside from the path [???] and went into the shadow of
the deeper woods [???] westward along the mountain - stream away from
[???] .
not far from the falls of [???] they found a [???] of trees [???] some of
which [???] the stream . their great grey trunks were of mighty girth [???] but
their height could not be guessed .
` i will climb up [???] ' said legolas . ` i am at home among trees [???] by root or
bough [???] though these trees are of a kind strange to me [???] save as a name in

song . [???] they are called [???] and are those that bear the yellow blossom [???]
but i have never climbed in one . i will see now what is their shape and way
of growth . '
` whatever it may be [???] ' said [???] [???] ` they will be marvellous trees
indeed if they can offer any rest at night [???] except to birds . i cannot sleep
on a perch ! '
' then dig a hole in the ground [???] ' said legolas [???] ` if that is more after
the fashion of your kind . but you must dig swift and deep [???] if you wish to
hide from [???] . ' he sprang lightly up from the ground and caught a branch
that grew from the trunk high above his head . but even as he swung there for
a moment [???] a voice spoke suddenly from the tree - shadows above him .
` daro ! ' it said in commanding tone [???] and legolas dropped back to earth
in surprise and fear . he shrank against the bole of the tree .
' stand still ! ' he whispered to the others . ` do not move or speak ! '
there was a sound of soft laughter over their heads [???] and then another
clear voice spoke in an elven - tongue . [???] could understand little of what
was said [???] for the speech that the silvan folk east of the mountains used
among themselves was unlike that of the west . legolas looked up and
answered
in the same language . *
` who are they [???] and what do they say ? ' asked merry .
` they ' re elves [???] ' said sam . ` can ' t you hear their voices ? '
` yes [???] they are elves [???] ' said legolas ; ` and they say that you breathe so
loud that they could shoot you in the dark . ' sam hastily put his hand over
his mouth . ' but they say also that you need have no fear . they have been
aware of us for a long while . they heard my voice across the [???] [???] and
knew that i was one of their northern kindred [???] and therefore they did not
hinder our crossing ; and afterwards they heard my song . now they bid me
climb up with [???] ; for they seem to have had some tidings of him and of
our journey . the others they ask to wait a little and to keep watch at the
foot of the tree [???] until they have decided what is to be done . '
out of the shadows a ladder was let down : it was made of rope [???]
silver - grey and [???] in the dark [???] and though it looked slender it
proved strong enough to bear many men . legolas ran lightly up [???] and [???]
followed slowly ; behind came sam trying not to breathe loudly . the branches
of the mallorn - tree grew out nearly straight from the trunk [???] and then swept
upward ; but near the top the main stem divided into a crown of many boughs [???]

and among these they found that there had been built a wooden platform [???] or
flet as such things were called in those days : the elves called it a talan .
it was reached by a round hole in the centre through which the ladder
passed .
when [???] came at last up on to the flet he found legolas seated with
three other elves . they were clad in shadowy - grey [???] and could not be seen
among the tree - stems [???] unless they moved suddenly . they stood up [???] and one of
them uncovered a small lamp that gave out a slender silver beam . he held it
up [???] looking at [???] ' s face [???] and sam ' s . then he shut off the light again [???]
and spoke words of welcome in his elven - tongue . [???] spoke haltingly in
return .
` welcome ! ' the elf then said again in the common language [???] speaking
slowly . ' we seldom use any tongue but our own ; for we dwell now in the heart
of the forest [???] and do not willingly have dealings with any other folk . even
our own kindred in the north are sundered from us . but there are some of us
still who go abroad for the gathering of news and the watching of our
enemies [???] and they speak the languages of other lands . i am one . [???] is my
name . my brothers [???] r [???] mil and [???] [???] speak little of your tongue .
` but we have heard rumours of your coming [???] for the messengers of [???]
passed by [???] on their way home up the [???] stair . we had not heard of
[???] [???] or halflings [???] for many a long year [???] and did not know that any yet
dwelt in middle - earth . you do not look evil ! and since you come with an elf
of our kindred [???] we are willing to [???] you [???] as [???] asked ; though it
is not our custom to lead strangers through our land . but you must stay here
tonight . how many are you ? '
` eight [???] ' said legolas . ` myself [???] four [???] ; and two men [???] one of whom [???]
[???] [???] is an elf - friend of the folk of westernesse . '
` the name of [???] son of [???] is known in [???] [???] ' said [???] [???]
` and he has the favour of the lady . all then is well . but you have yet
spoken only of seven . '
` the eighth is a dwarf [???] ' said legolas .
` a dwarf ! ' said [???] . ` that is not well . we have not had dealings
wi th the [???] since the dark days . they are not permitted in our land . i
cannot allow him to pass . '
` but he is from the lonely mountain [???] one of [???] ' s trusty people [???] and
friendly to [???] [???] ' said [???] . ` [???] himself chose him to be one of our
companions [???] and he has been brave and faithful . '

the elves spoke together in soft voices [???] and questioned legolas in
their own tongue . ' very good [???] ' said [???] at last . ` we will do this [???] though
it is against our liking . if [???] and legolas will guard him [???] and answer
for him [???] he shall pass ; but he must go blindfold through [???] .
` but now we must debate no longer . your folk must not remain on the
ground . we have been keeping watch on the rivers [???] ever since we saw a great
troop of [???] going north toward moria [???] along the skirts of the mountains [???]
many days ago . wolves are howling on the wood ' s borders . if you have indeed
come from moria [???] the peril cannot be far behind . tomorrow early you must go
on .
' the four [???] shall c limb up here and stay with us - we do not fear
them ! there is another talan in the next tree . there the others must take
[???] . you [???] legolas [???] must answer to us for them . call us [???] if anything is
amiss ! and have an eye on that dwarf ! '
legolas at once went down the ladder to take [???] ' s message ; and soon
afterwards merry and [???] [???] up on to the high flet . they were out
of breath and seemed rather scared .
` there ! ' said merry panting . ` we have lugged up your blankets as well
as our own . strider has hidden all the rest of the [???] in a deep drift
of leaves . '
` you had no need of your burdens [???] ' said [???] . ` it is cold in the
tree - tops in winter [???] though the wind tonight is in the south ; but we have
food and drink to give you that will drive away the night - chill [???] and we have
skins and cloaks to spare . '
the [???] accepted this second ( and far better ) supper very gladly .
then they wrapped themselves warmly [???] not only in the fur - cloaks of the
elves [???] but in their own blankets as well [???] and tried to go to sleep . but
weary as they were only sam found that easy to do . [???] do not like
heights [???] and do not sleep upstairs [???] even when they have any stairs . the flet
was not at all to their liking as a bedroom . it had no walls . not even a
rail ; only on one side was there a light [???] screen [???] which could be
moved and fixed in different places according to the wind .
[???] went on talking for a while . ` i hope [???] if i do go to sleep in
this bed - loft [???] that i shan ' t roll off [???] ' he said .
` once i do get to sleep [???] ' said sam [???] ' i shall go on sleeping [???] whether i
roll off or no . and the less said [???] the sooner i ' ll drop off [???] if you take my
meaning . '

[???] lay for some time awake [???] and looked up at the stars [???]
through the pale roof of [???] leaves . sam was [???] at his side long
before he himself closed his eyes . he could dimly see the grey forms of two
elves sitting motionless with their arms about their knees [???] speaking in
whispers . the other had gone down to take up his watch on one of the lower
branches . at last lulled by the wind in the boughs above [???] and the sweet
murmur of the falls of [???] below [???] [???] fell asleep with the song of
legolas running in his mind .
late in the night he awoke . the other [???] were asleep . the elves
were gone . the sickle moon was gleaming dimly among the leaves . the wind
was
still . a little way off he heard a harsh laugh and the tread of many feet on
the ground below . there was a ring of metal . the sounds died slowly away [???]
and seemed to go southward [???] on into the wood .
a head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet . [???] sat up in
alarm and saw that it was a grey - hooded elf . he looked towards the [???] .
` what is it ? ' said [???] .
` [???] ! ' said the elf in a hissing whisper [???] and cast on to the flet the
rope - ladder rolled up .
' [???] ! ' said [???] . ` what are they doing ? ' but the elf had gone .
there were no more sounds . even the leaves were silent [???] and the very
falls seemed to be hushed . [???] sat and shivered in his wraps . he was
thankful that they had not been caught on the ground ; but he felt that the
trees offered little protection [???] except concealment . [???] were as keen as
hounds on a scent [???] it was said [???] but they could also climb . he drew out
sting : it flashed and glittered like a blue flame and then slowly faded
again and grew dull . in spite of the fading of his sword the feeling of
immediate danger did no t leave [???] [???] rather it grew stronger . he got up and
[???] to the opening and peered down . he was almost certain that he could
hear [???] movements at the tree ' s foot far below .
not elves ; for the woodland folk were altogether noiseless in their
movements . then he heard faintly a sound like [???] : and something seemed
to be [???] on the bark of the tree - trunk . he stared down into the
dark [???] holding his breath .
something was now climbing slowly [???] and its breath came like a soft
hissing through closed teeth . then coming up [???] close to the stem [???] [???] saw

two pale eyes . they stopped and gazed upward unwinking . suddenly they
turned
away [???] and a shadowy figure slipped round the trunk of the tree and vanished .
immediately afterwards [???] came climbing swiftly up through the
branches . ` there was something in this tree that i have never seen before [???] '
he said . ` it was not an orc . it fled as soon as i touched the tree - stem . it
seemed to be wary [???] and to have some skill in trees [???] or i might have thought
that it was one of you [???] .
' i did not shoot [???] for i dared not arouse any cries : we cannot risk
battle . a strong company of [???] has passed . they crossed the [???] - curse
their foul feet in its clean water ! - and went on down the old road beside the
river . they seemed to pick up some scent [???] and they searched the ground for a
while near the place where you halted . the three of us could not challenge a
hundred [???] so we went ahead and spoke with feigned voices [???] leading them on
into the wood .
` [???] has now gone in haste back to our dwellings to warn our
people . none of the [???] will ever return out of [???] . and there will be
many elves hidden on the northern border before another night falls . bu t you
must take the road south as soon as it is fully light . '
day came pale from the east . as the light grew it filtered through the
yellow leaves of the mallorn [???] and it seemed to the [???] that the early
sun of a cool summer ' s morning was shining . pale - blue sky peeped among the
moving branches . looking through an opening on the south side of the flet
[???] saw all the valley of the [???] lying like a sea of fallow gold
tossing gently in the breeze .
the morning was still young and cold when the company set out again [???]
guided now by [???] and his brother r [???] mil . ` farewell [???] sweet [???] ! '
cried legolas . [???] looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among
the
grey tree - stems . ` farewell [???] ' he said . it seemed to him tha t he would never
hear again a running water so beautiful [???] for ever [???] its [???]
notes in an endless changeful music .
they went back to the path that still went on along the west side of
the [???] [???] and for some way they followed it southward . there were the
prints of orc - feet in the earth . but soon [???] turned aside into the trees
and halted on the bank of the river under their shadows .
` there is one of my people yonder across the stream [???] ' he said ` though

you may not see him . ' he gave a call like the low whistle of a bird [???] and out
of a thicket of young trees an elf stepped [???] clad in grey [???] but with his hood
thrown back ; his hair glinted like gold in the morning sun . [???] [???]
cast over the stream a coil of grey rope [???] and he caught it and bound the end
about a tree near the bank .
` celebrant is already a strong stream here [???] as you see [???] ' said [???]
' and it runs both swift and deep [???] and is very cold . we do not set foot in it
so far north [???] unless we must . but in these days of watchfulness we do not
make bridges . this is how we cross ! follow me ! ' he made his end of the rope
fast about another tree [???] and then ran lightly along it [???] over the river and
back again [???] as if he were on a road .
` i can walk this path [???] ' said legolas ; ` but the others have not this
skill . must they swim ? '
` no ! ' said [???] . ` we have two more ropes . we will fasten them above
the other [???] one shoulder - high [???] and another half - high [???] and holding these the
strangers should be able to cross with care . '
when this slender bridge had been made [???] the company passed over [???] some
[???] and slowly [???] others more easily . of the [???] [???] proved the
best for he was sure - footed [???] and he walked over quickly [???] holding only with
one hand ; but he kept his eyes on the bank ahead and did not look down . sam
shuffled along [???] clutching hard [???] and looking down into the pale [???] water
as if it was a chasm in the mountains .
he breathed with relief when he was safely across . ` live and learn ! as
my [???] used to say . though he was thinking of gardening [???] not of [???]
like a bird [???] nor of trying to walk like a spider . not even my uncle andy
ever did a trick like that ! '
when at length all the company was gathered on the east bank of the
[???] [???] the elves untied the ropes and coiled two of them . r [???] mil [???] who
had remained on the other side [???] drew back the last one [???] slung it on his
shoulder [???] and with a wave of his hand went away [???] back to [???] to keep
watch .
` now [???] friends [???] ' said [???] [???] ` you have entered the [???] of [???] or
the gore [???] as you would say [???] for it is the land that lies like a spear - head
between the arms of [???] and [???] the great . we allow no strangers
to spy out the secrets of the [???] . few indeed are permitted even to set
foot there .
` as was agreed [???] i shall here blindfold the eyes of [???] the dwarf . the

other may walk free for a while [???] until we come nearer to our dwellings [???] down
in [???] [???] in the angle between the waters . '
this was not at all to the liking of [???] . ` the agreement was made
without my consent [???] ' he said . ` i will not walk blindfold [???] like a beggar or a
prisoner . and i am no spy . my folk have never had dealings with any of the
servants of the enemy . neither have we done harm to the elves . i am no more
likely to betray you than legolas [???] or any other of my companions . '
' i do not doubt you [???] ' said [???] . ' yet this is our law . i am not the
master of the law [???] and cannot set it aside . i have done much in letting you
set foot over celebrant . '
[???] was obstinate . he planted his feet firmly apart [???] and laid his
hand upon the haft of his axe . ' i will go forward free [???] ' he said [???] ' or i will
go back and seek my own land [???] where i am known to be true of word [???] though i
perish alone in the wilderness . '
` you cannot go back [???] ' said [???] sternly . ' now you have come thus far [???]
you must be brought before the lord and the lady . they shall judge you [???] to
hold you or to give you leave [???] as they will . you cannot cross the rivers
again [???] and behind you there are now secret [???] that you cannot pass .
you would be slain before you saw them . '
[???] drew his axe from his belt . [???] and his companion bent their
bows . ' a plague on [???] and their stiff necks ! ' said legolas .
' come ! ' said [???] . ` if i am still to lead this company [???] you must do
as i bid . it is hard upon the dwarf to be thus singled out . we will all be
blindfold [???] even legolas . that will be best [???] though it will make the journey
slow and dull . '
[???] laughed suddenly . ` a merry troop of fools we shall look ! will
[???] lead us all on a string [???] like many blind beggars with one dog ? but i
will be content [???] if only legolas here shares my blindness . '
` i am an elf and a kinsman here [???] ' said legolas [???] becoming angry in his
turn .
` now let us cry : [???] a plague on the stiff necks of elves ! [???] ' said [???] .
` but the company shall all fare alike . come [???] bind our eyes [???] ! '
` i shall claim full amends for every fall and stubbed toe [???] if you do
not lead us well [???] ' said [???] as they bound a cloth about his eyes .
' you will have no claim [???] ' said [???] . ` i shall lead you well [???] and the
paths are smooth and straight . '
` alas for the folly of these days ! ' said legolas . ' here all are

enemies of the one enemy [???] and yet i must walk blind [???] while the sun is merry
in the woodland under leaves of gold ! '
` folly it may seem [???] ' said [???] . ' indeed in nothing is the power of
the dark lord more clearly shown than in the [???] that divides all
those who still oppose him . yet so little faith and trust do we find now in
the world beyond [???] [???] unless maybe in [???] [???] that we dare not by
our own trust endanger our land . we live now upon an island amid many
perils [???] and our hands are more often upon the [???] than upon the harp .
` the rivers long defended us [???] but they are a sure guard no more for the
shadow has crept northward all about us . some speak of departing [???] yet for
that it already seems too late . the mountains to the west are growing evil ;
to the east the lands are waste [???] and full of [???] ' s creatures ; and it is
rumoured that we cannot now safely pass southward through [???] [???] and the
mouths of the great river are watched by the enemy . even if we could come
to
the shores of the sea [???] we should find no longer any shelter there . it is
said that there are still havens of . the high elves [???] but they are far north
and west [???] beyond the land of the halflings . but where that may be [???] though
the lord and lady may know [???] i do not . '
` you ought at least to guess [???] since you have seen us [???] ' said merry .
` there are elf - havens west of my land [???] the shire where [???] live . '
` happy folk are [???] to dwell near the shores of the sea ! ' said
[???] . ' it is long indeed since any of my folk have looked on it [???] yet still
we remember it in song . tell me of these havens as we walk . '
` i cannot [???] ' said merry . ` i have never seen them . i have never been out
of my own la nd before . and if i had known what the world outside was like . i
don ' t think i should have had the heart to leave it . '
` not even to see fair [???] ? ' said [???] . ' the world is indeed
full of peril [???] and in it there are many dark places ; but still there is much
that is fair [???] and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief [???] it
grows perhaps the greater .
` some there are among us who sing that the shadow will draw back and
peace shall come again . yet i do not believe that the world about us will
ever again be as it was of old [???] or the light of the sun as it was [???] .
for the elves [???] i fear [???] it will prove at best a truce [???] in which they may pass
to the sea [???] and leave the middle - earth for ever . alas for
[???] that i love ! it would be a poor life in a land where no mallorn

grew . but if there are mallorn - trees beyond the great sea [???] none have
reported it . '
as they spoke thus [???] the company filed slowly along the paths in the
wood [???] led by hald ir [???] while the other elf walked behind . they felt the ground
beneath their feet smooth and soft [???] and after a while they walked more
freely [???] without fear of hurt or fall . being [???] of sight [???] [???] found
his hearing and other senses sharpened . he could smell the trees and the
trodden grass . he could hear many different notes in the rustle of the
leaves overhead [???] the river murmuring away on his right [???] and the thin clear
voices of birds in the sky . he felt the sun upon his face and hands when
they passed through an open glade .
as soon as he set foot upon the far bank of [???] a strange
feeling had come upon him [???] and it deepened as he walked on into the [???] :
it seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge of time into a corner of
the elder days [???] and was - now walking in a world that was no more . in
[???] there was memory of ancient things ; in [???] the ancient things
still lived on in the waking world . evil had been seen and heard there [???]
sorrow had been known ; the elves feared and [???] the world outside :
wolves were howling on the wood ' s borders : but on the land of [???] no
shadow lay .
all that day the company marched on [???] until they felt the cool evening
come and heard the early night - wind whispering among many leaves . then
they
rested and slept without fear upon the ground ; for their guides would not
permit them to unbind their eyes [???] and they could not climb . in the morning
they went on again [???] walking without hast e . at noon they halted [???] and [???]
was aware that they had passed out under the shining sun . suddenly he heard
the sound of many voices all around him .
a marching host of elves had come up silently : they were hastening
toward the northern borders to guard against any attack from moria ; and they
brought news [???] some of which [???] reported . the [???] [???] had been
[???] and almost all destroyed ; the [???] had fled westward towards the
mountains [???] and were being pursued . a strange creature also had been seen [???]
running with bent back and with hands near the ground [???] like a beast and yet
not of beast - shape . it had eluded capture [???] and they had not shot it [???] not
knowing whether it was good or ill [???] and it had vanished down the [???]
southward .

` also [???] ' said [???] [???] ` they bring me a message from the lord and lady of
the [???] . you are all to walk free [???] even the dwarf [???] . it seems that
the lady knows who and what is each member of your company . new
messages
have come from [???] perhaps . '
he removed the bandage first from [???] ' s eyes . ' your pardon ! ' he
said [???] bowing low . ` look on us now with friendly eyes ! look and be glad [???] for
you are the first dwarf to behold the trees of the [???] of [???] since
durin ' s day ! '
when his eyes were in turn uncovered [???] [???] looked up and caught his
breath . they were standing in an open space . to the left stood a great
mound [???] covered with a sward of grass as green as spring - time in the elder
days . upon it [???] as a double crown [???] grew two circles of trees : the outer had
bark of snowy white [???] and were leafless but beautiful in their shapely
nakedness ; the inner were mallorn - trees of great height [???] still arrayed in
pale gold . high amid the branches of a towering tree that stood in the
centre of all there gleamed a white flet . at the feet of the trees [???] and all
about the green hillsides the grass was studded with small golden flowers
shaped like stars . among them [???] nodding on slender stalks [???] were other
flowers [???] white and palest green : they [???] as a mist amid the rich hue
of the grass . over all the sky was blue [???] and the sun of afternoon glowed
upon the hill and cast long green shadows beneath the trees .
' behold ! you are come to cerin amroth [???] ' said [???] . ` for this is the
heart of the ancient realm as it was long ago [???] and here is the mound of
amroth [???] where in happier days his high house was built . here ever bloom the
winter flowers in the unfading grass : the yellow elanor [???] and the pale
[???] . here we will stay awhile [???] and come to the city of the [???]
at [???] . '
the others cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass [???] but [???]
stood awhile still lost in wonder . it seemed to him that he had stepped
through a high window that looked on a vanished world . a light was upon it
for which his language had no name . all that he saw was shapely [???] but the
shapes seemed at once clear cut [???] as if they had been first conceived and
drawn at the uncovering of his eyes [???] and ancient as if they had endured for
ever . he saw no colour but those he knew [???] gold and white and blue and green [???]
but they were fresh and [???] [???] as if he had at that moment first

perceived them and made for them names new and wonderful . in winter here
no
heart could mourn for summer or for spring . no blemish or sickness or
[???] could be seen in anything that grew upon the earth . on the land of
[???] there was no stain .
he turned and saw that sam was now standing beside him [???] looking round
with a puzzled expression [???] and rubbing his eyes as if he was not sure that
he was awake . ` it ' s sunlight and bright day [???] right enough [???] ' he said . ` i
thought that elves were all for moon and stars : but this is more elvish than
anything i ever heard tell of . i feel as if i was inside a song . if you take
my meaning . '
[???] looked at them [???] and he seemed indeed to take the meaning of both
thought and word . he smiled . ` you feel the power of the lady of the
[???] [???] ' he said . ` would it please you to climb with me up cerin amroth ?
'
they followed him as he stepped lightly up the grass - clad [???] .
though he walked and breathed [???] and about him living leaves and flowers were
stirred by the same cool wind as fanned his face [???] [???] felt that he was in
a timeless land that did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulness . when
he had gone and passed again into the outer world [???] still [???] the wanderer
from the shire would walk there [???] upon the grass among elanor and [???]
in fair [???] .
they entered the circle of white trees . as they did so the south wind
blew upon cerin amroth and sighed among the branches . [???] stood still [???]
hearing far off _ great seas upon beaches that had long ago been washed away [???]
and sea - birds crying whose race had perished from the earth .
[???] had gone on and was now climbing to the high flet . as [???]
prepared to follow him [???] he laid his hand upon the tree beside the ladder :
never before had he been so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel and
texture of a tree ' s skin and of the life within it . he felt a delight in
wood and the touch of it [???] neither as forester nor as [???] ; it was the
delight of the living tree itself .
as he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform [???] [???] took his hand
and turned him toward the south . ` look this way first ! ' he said .
[???] looked and saw [???] still at some distance [???] a hill of many mighty
trees [???] or a city of green towers : which it was he could not tell . out of it [???]
it seemed to him that the power and light came that held all the land in

sway . he longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the green city . then
he looked eastward and saw all the land of [???] running down to the pale
gleam of [???] [???] the great river . he lifted his eyes across the river and
all the light went out [???] and he was back again in the world he knew . beyond
the river the land appeared flat and empty [???] formless and vague [???] until far
away it rose again like a wall [???] dark and drear . the sun that lay on
[???] had no power to [???] the shadow of that distant height .
` there lies the fastness of southern [???] [???] ' said [???] . ` it is
clad in a forest of dark fir [???] where the trees strive one against another and
their branches rot and wither . in the midst upon a stony height stands dol
[???] [???] where long the hidden enemy had his dwelling . we fear that now it is
inhabited again [???] and with power sevenfold . a black cloud lies often over it
of late . in this high place you may see the two powers that are opposed one
to another ; and ever they strive now in thought [???] but whereas the light
perceives the very heart of the darkness [???] its own secret has not been
discovered . not yet . ' he turned and climbed swiftly down [???] and they followed
him .
at the hill ' s foot [???] found [???] [???] standing still and silent as a
tree ; but in his hand was a small golden bloom of elanor [???] and a light was in
his eyes . he was wrapped in some fair memory : and as [???] looked at him he
knew that he beheld things as they once had been in this same place . for the
grim years were removed from the face of [???] [???] and he seemed clothed in
white [???] a young lord tall and fair ; and he spoke words in the elvish tongue
to one whom [???] could not see . [???] [???] [???] [???] ! he said [???] and then
he drew a breath [???] and returning out of his thought he looked at [???] and
smiled .
` here is the heart of [???] on earth [???] ' he said [???] ` and here my heart
dwells ever [???] unless there be a light beyond the dark roads that we still
must tread [???] you and i . come with me ! ' and taking [???] ' s hand in his [???] he
left the hill of cerin amroth and came there never again as living man .




chapter 7 . the mirror of [???]



the sun was sinking behind the mountains [???] and the shadows were
deepening in the woods [???] when they went on again . their paths now went into
thickets where the [???] had already gathered . night came beneath the trees
as they walked [???] and the elves uncovered their silver lamps .
suddenly they came out into the open again and found themselves under a
pale evening sky pricked by a few early stars . there was a wide treeless
space before them [???] running in a great circle and bending away on either
hand . beyond it was a deep [???] lost in soft shadow [???] but the grass upon its
brink was green [???] as if it glowed still in memory of the sun that had gone .
upon the further side there rose to a great height a green wall [???] a
green hill thronged with mallorn - trees taller than any they had yet seen in
all the land . their height could not be guessed [???] but they stood up in the
[???] like living towers . in their [???] many - tiered branches and amid their
ever - moving leaves countless lights were gleaming [???] green and gold and
silver . [???] turned towards the company .
` welcome to caras [???] ! ' he said . ' here is the city of the
[???] where dwell the lord [???] and [???] the lady of [???] .
but we cannot enter here [???] for the gates do not look northward . we must go
round to the southern side [???] and the way is not short [???] for the city is
great . '
there was a road paved with white stone running on the outer brink of
the [???] . along this they wen t westward [???] with the city ever climbing up
like a green cloud upon their left ; and as the night deepened more lights
sprang forth [???] until all the hill seemed afire with stars . they came at last
to a white bridge [???] and crossing found the great gates of the city : they
faced south - west [???] set between the ends of the [???] wall that here
[???] [???] and they were tall and strong [???] and hung with many lamps .
[???] knocked and spoke [???] and the gates opened [???] ; but of
guards [???] could see no sign . the travellers passed within [???] and the gates
shut behind them . they were in a deep lane between the ends of the wall [???] and
passing quickly through it they entered the city of the trees . no folk could
they see [???] nor hear any feet upon the paths ; but there were many voices [???]
about them [???] and in the air above . far away up on the hill they could hear

the sound of singing falling from on high like soft rain upon leaves .
they went along many paths and climbed many stairs [???] until they came to
the high places and saw before them amid a wide lawn a fountain [???] .
it was lit by silver lamps that swung from the boughs of trees [???] and it fell
into a basin of silver [???] from which a white stream spilled . upon the south
side of the lawn there stood the mightiest of all the trees ; its great
smooth bole gleamed like grey silk [???] and up it towered [???] until its first
branches [???] far above [???] opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves .
beside it a broad white ladder stood [???] and at its foot three elves were
seated . they sprang up as the travellers approached [???] and [???] saw that they
were tall and clad in grey mail [???] and from their shoulders hung long white
cloaks .
' here dwell [???] and [???] [???] ' said [???] . ` it is their wish
that you should ascend and speak with them . '
one of the elf - wardens then blew a clear note on a small horn [???] and it
was answered three times from far above . ` i will go first [???] ' said [???] .
' let [???] come next and with him legolas . the others may follow as they
wish . it is a long climb for those that are not accustomed to such stairs [???]
but you may rest upon the way . '
as he climbed slowly up [???] passed many flets : some on one side [???] some
on another [???] and some set about the bole of the tree [???] so that the ladder
passed through them . at a great height above the ground he came to a wide
talan [???] like the deck of a great ship . on it was built a house [???] so large that
almost it would have served for a hall of men upon the earth . he entered
behind [???] [???] and found that he was in a chamber of oval shape [???] in the
midst of which grew the trunk of the great mallorn [???] now tapering towards its
crown [???] and yet making still a pillar of wide girth .
the chamber was filled with a soft light ; its walls were green and
silver and its roof of gold . many elves were seated there . on two chairs
beneath the bole of the tree and canopied by a living bough there sat [???] side
by side [???] [???] and [???] . they stood up to greet their guests [???] after
the manner of elves [???] even those who were accounted mighty kings . very tall
they were [???] and the lady no less tall than the lord ; and they were grave and
beautiful . they were clad wholly in white ; and the hair of the lady was of
deep gold [???] and the hair of the lord [???] was of silver long and bright ;
but no sign of age was upon them [???] unless it were in the depths of their
eyes ; for these were keen as lances in the starlight [???] and yet profound [???] the

wells of deep memory .
[???] led [???] before them [???] and the lord welcomed him in his own
tongue . the lady [???] said no word but looked long upon his face .
` sit now beside my chair [???] [???] of the shire ! ' said [???] . ` when
all have come we will speak together . '
each of the companions he greeted courteously by name as they entered .
` welcome [???] son of [???] ! ' he said . ` it is eight and thirty years
of the world outside since you came to this land ; and those years lie heavy
on you . but the end is near [???] for good or ill . here lay aside your burden for
a while ! '
' welcome son of [???] ! too seldom do my kindred journey hither from
the north . '
` welcome [???] son of [???] ! it is long indeed since we saw one of
durin ' s folk in caras [???] . but today we have broken our long law . may
it be a sign that though the world is now dark better days are at hand [???] and
that friendship shall be renewed between our peoples . ' [???] bowed low .
when all the guests were seated before his chair the lord looked at
them again . ' here there are eight [???] ' he said . ` nine were to set out : so said
the messages . but maybe there has been some change of counsel that we have
not heard . [???] is far away [???] and darkness gathers between us [???] and all this
year the shadows have grown longer . '
` nay [???] there was no change of counsel [???] ' said the lady [???] speaking
for the first time . her voice was clear and musical [???] but deeper than woman ' s
wont . ` [???] the grey set out with the company [???] but he did not pass the
borders of this land . now tell us where he is ; for i much desired to speak
with him again . but i cannot see him from afar [???] unless he comes within the
fences of [???] : a grey mist is about him [???] and the ways of his feet and
of his mind are hidden from me . '
' alas ! ' said [???] . ` [???] the grey fell into shadow . he remained
in moria and did not escape . '
at these words all the elves in the hall cried aloud in grief and
amazement . ` these are evil tidings [???] ' said [???] [???] ` the most evil that have
been spoken here in long years full of grievous deeds . ' he turned to [???] .
` why has nothing of this been told to me before ? ' he asked in the
elven - tongue .
' we have not spoken to [???] of our deeds or our purpose [???] ' said
legolas . ` at first we were weary and danger was too close behind and

afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a time [???] as we walked in gladness
on the fair paths of [???] . '
` yet our grief is great and our loss cannot be mended [???] ' said [???] .
' [???] was our guide [???] and he led us through moria ; and when our escape
seemed beyond hope he saved us [???] and he fell . '
' tell us now the full tale ! ' said [???] :
then [???] recounted all that had happened upon the pass of
[???] [???] and in the days that followed ; and he spoke of balin and his
book [???] and the fight in the chamber of [???] [???] and the fire [???] and the narrow
bridge [???] and the coming of the terror . ' an evil of the ancient world it
seemed [???] such as i have never seen before [???] ' said [???] . ` it was both a
shadow and a flame [???] strong and terrible . '
' it was a balrog of [???] [???] ' said legolas ; ` of all elf - banes the most
deadly [???] save the one who sits in the dark tower . '
` indeed i saw upon the bridge that which haunts our darkest dreams l
saw durin ' s bane [???] ' said [???] in a low voice [???] and dread was in his eyes .
' alas ! ' said [???] . ` we long have feared that under [???] a
terror slept . but had i known that the [???] had st irred up this evil in
moria again [???] l would have forbidden you to pass the northern borders [???] you
and all that went with you . and if it were possible [???] one would say that at
the last [???] fell from wisdom into folly [???] going needlessly into the net
of moria . '
` he would be rash indeed that said that thing [???] ' said [???] gravely .
` needless were none of the deeds of [???] in life . those that followed him
knew not his mind and cannot report his full purpose . but however it may be
with the guide [???] the followers are blameless . do not repent of your welcome
to the dwarf . if our folk had been exiled long and far from [???] [???] who
of the [???] [???] even [???] the wise [???] would pass nigh and would not
wish
to look upon their ancient home [???] though it had become an [???] of dragons ?
' dark is the water of [???] - [???] [???] and cold are the springs of
[???] - [???] [???] and fair were the many - pillared halls of [???] - dym in elder
days before the fall of mighty kings beneath the stone . ' she looked upon
[???] [???] who sat glowering and sad [???] and she smiled . and the dwarf [???] hearing the
names given in his own ancient tongue [???] looked up and met her eyes ; and it
seemed to him that he looked suddenly into the heart of an enemy and saw
there love and understanding . wonder came into his face [???] and then he smiled

in answer .
he rose [???] and bowed in dwarf - fashion [???] saying : ` yet more fair is
the living land of [???] [???] and the lady [???] is above all the jewels
that lie beneath the earth ! '
there was a silence . at length [???] spoke again . ` i did not know
that your plight was so evil [???] ' he said . ` let [???] forget my harsh words : i
spoke in the trouble of my heart . i will do what i can to aid you [???] each
according to his wish and need [???] but especially that one of the little folk
who bears the burden . '
' your quest is known to us [???] ' said [???] [???] looking at [???] . ` but we
will not here speak of it more openly . yet not in vain will it prove [???] maybe [???]
that you came to this land seeking aid [???] as [???] himself plainly purposed .
for the lord of the [???] is accounted the wisest of the elves of
middle - earth [???] and a giver of gifts beyond the power of kings . he has dwelt
in the west since the days of dawn [???] and i have dwelt with him years
[???] ; for ere the fall of [???] or [???] i passed over the
mountains [???] and together through ages of the world we have fought the long
defeat .
' i it was who first summoned the white council . and if my designs had
not gone amiss [???] it would have been governed by [???] the grey [???] and then
[???] things would have gone otherwise . but even now there is hope left . i
will not give you counsel [???] saying do this [???] or do that . for not in doing or
contriving [???] nor in choosing between this course and another [???] can i avail ;
but only in knowing what was and is [???] and in part also what shall be . but
this i will say to you : your quest stands upon the edge of a knife . stray
but a little and it will fail [???] to the ruin of all . yet hope remains while
all the company is true . '
and with that word she held them with her eyes [???] and in silence looked
searchingly at each of them in turn . none save legolas and [???] could
long endure her glance . sam quickly blushed and hung his head .
at length the lady [???] released them from her eyes [???] and she
smiled . ` do not let your hearts be troubled [???] ' she said . ' tonight you shall
sleep in peace . ' then they sighed and felt suddenly weary [???] as those who have
been questioned long and deeply [???] though no words had been spoken openly .
` go now ! ' said [???] . ` you are worn with sorrow and much toil . even
if your quest did not concern us closely [???] you should have [???] in this
city [???] until you were healed and refreshed . now you shall rest [???] and we will

not speak of your further road for a while . '
that night the company slept upon the ground [???] much to the satisfaction
of the [???] . the elves spread for them a [???] among the trees near
the fountain [???] and in it they laid soft couches ; then speaking words of peace
with fair elvish voices they left them . for a little while the travellers
talked of their night before in the tree - tops [???] and of their day ' s journey [???]
and of the lord and lady ; for they had not yet the heart to look further
back .
` what did you blush for [???] sam ? ' said [???] . ` you soon broke down .
anyone would have thought you had a guilty conscience . i hope it was nothing
worse than a wicked plot to steal one of my blankets . '
` i never thought no such thing [???] ' answered sam [???] in no mood for jest . ' if
you want to know [???] i felt as if i hadn ' t got nothing on [???] and i didn ' t like
it . she seemed to be looking inside me and asking me what i would do if she
gave me the chance of flying back home to the shire to a nice little hole
with - with a bit of garden of my own . '
` that ' s funny [???] ' said merry . ' almost exactly what i felt myself ; only [???]
only well [???] i don ' t think i ' ii say any more [???] ' he ended lamely .
all of them [???] it seemed [???] had fared alike : each had felt that he was
offered a choice between a shadow full of fear that lay ahead [???] and something
that he greatly desired : clear before his mind it lay [???] and to get it he had
only to turn aside from the road and leave the quest and the war against
[???] to others .
` and it seemed to me [???] too [???] ' said [???] [???] ` that my choice would remain
secret and known only to myself . '
' to me it seemed exceedingly strange [???] ' said [???] . ` maybe it was only
a test [???] and she thought to read our thoughts for her own good purpose ; but
almost i should have said that she was tempting us [???] and offering what she
pretended to have the power to give . it need not be said that i refused to
listen . the men of minas [???] are true to their word . ' but what he thought
that the lady had offered him [???] did not tell .
and as for [???] [???] he would not speak [???] though [???] pressed him with
questions . ` she held you long in her gaze [???] ring - bearer [???] ' he said .
` yes [???] ' said [???] ; ` but whatever came into my mind then i will keep
there . '
` well [???] have a care ! ' said [???] . ` i do not feel too sure of this
elvish lady and her purposes . '

` speak no evil of the lady [???] ! ' said [???] sternly . ' you know
not what you say . there is in her and in this land no evil [???] unless a man
bring it hither himself . then let him beware ! but tonight i shall sleep
without fear for the first time since i left [???] . and may i sleep
deep [???] and forget for a while my grief ! i am weary in body and in heart . ' he
cast himself down upon his couch and fell at once into a long sleep .
the others soon did the same [???] and no sound or dream disturbed their
slumber . when they woke they found that the light of day was broad upon the
lawn before the [???] . and the fountain rose and fell glittering in the
sun .
they remained some days in [???] [???] so far as they could tell or
remember . all the while that they dwelt there the sun shone clear [???] save for
a gentle rain that fell at times [???] and passed away leaving all things fresh
and clean . the air was cool and soft [???] as if it were early spring [???] yet they
felt about them the deep and thoughtful quiet of winter . it seemed to them
that they did little but eat and drink and rest [???] and walk among the trees ;
and it was enough .
they had not seen the lord and lady again [???] and they had little speech
with the elven - folk ; for few of these knew or would use the westron tongue .
[???] had bidden them farewell and gone back again to the fences of the
north [???] where great watch was now kept since the tidings of moria that the
company had brought . legolas was away much among the [???] [???] and
after
the first night he did not sleep with the other companions [???] though he
returned to eat and talk with them . often he took [???] with him when he
went abroad in the land [???] and the others wondered at this change .
now as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of [???] [???] and
all that each had known and seen of him came clear before their minds . as
they were healed of hurt and weariness of body the grief of their loss grew
more keen . often they heard nearby elvish voices singing [???] and knew that they
were making songs of lamentation for his fall [???] for they caught his name
among the sweet sad words that they could not understand .
[???] [???] [???] sang the elves [???] o pilgrim grey ! for so they
loved to call him . but if legolas was with the company [???] he would not
interpret the songs for them [???] saying that he had not the skill [???] and that for
him the grief was still too near [???] a matter for tears and not yet for song .
it was [???] who first put something of his sorrow into halting words .

he was seldom moved to make song or rhyme ; even in [???] he had
listened
and had not sung himself [???] though his memory was stored with many things that
others had made before him . but now as he sat beside the fountain in [???]
and heard about him the voices of the elves [???] his thought took shape in a
song that seemed fair to him ; yet when he tried to repeat it to sam only
snatches remained [???] faded as a handful of withered leaves .
when evening in the shire was grey
his [???] on the hill were heard ;
before the dawn he went away
on journey long without a word .

from wilderland to western shore [???]
from northern waste to southern hill [???]
through dragon - lair and hidden door
and darkling woods he walked at will .

with dwarf and hobbit [???] elves and men [???]
with mortal and immortal folk [???]
with bird on bough and beast in den [???]
in their own secret tongues he spoke .

a deadly sword [???] a healing hand [???]
a back that bent beneath its load ;
a trumpet - voice [???] a burning brand [???]
a weary pilgrim on the road .

a lord of wisdom throned he sat [???]
swift in anger [???] quick to laugh ;
an old man in a battered hat
who leaned upon a thorny staff .

he stood upon the bridge alone
and fire and shadow both defied ;
his staff was broken on the stone [???]
in [???] - dym his wisdom died .
` why [???] you ' ll be beating mr . [???] next ! ' said sam .

' no [???] i am afraid not [???] ' said [???] . ' but that is the best i can do yet . '
' well [???] mr . [???] [???] if you do have another go [???] i hope you ' ll say a word
about his [???] [???] ' said sam . ` something like this :
the finest rockets ever seen :
they burst in stars of blue and green [???]
or after thunder golden showers
came falling like a rain of flowers .
though that doesn ' t do them justice by a long road . '
` no [???] i ' ll leave that to you [???] sam . or perhaps to [???] . but - well . i
can ' t talk of it any more . i can ' t bear to think of bringing the news to
him . '
one evening [???] and sam were walking together in the cool [???] .
both of them felt restless again . on [???] suddenly the shadow of parting
had fallen : he knew somehow that the time was very near when he must leave
[???] .
` what do you think of elves now [???] sam ? ' he said . ` i asked you the same
question once before - it seems a very long while ago ; but you have seen more
of them since then . '
' i have indeed ! ' said sam . ' and i reckon there ' s elves and elves .
they ' re all elvish enough [???] but they ' re not all the same . now these folk
aren ' t wanderers or homeless [???] and seem a bit nearer to the likes of us : they
seem to belong here [???] more even than [???] do in the shire . whether they ' ve
made the land [???] or the land ' s made them [???] it ' s hard to say [???] if you take my
meaning . it ' s wonderfully quiet here . nothing seems to be going on [???] and
nobody seems to want it to . if there ' s any magic about [???] it ' s right down
deep [???] where i can ' t lay my hands on it [???] in a manner of speaking . '
' you can see and feel it everywhere [???] ' said [???] .
' well [???] ' said sam [???] ' you can ' t see nobody working it . no [???] like
poor [???] used to show . i wonder we don ' t see nothing of the lord and
lady in all these days . i fancy now that she could do some wonderful things [???]
if she had a mind . i ' d dearly love to see some elf - magic [???] mr . [???] ! '
' i wouldn ' t [???] ' said [???] . ` i am content . and i don ' t miss [???] ' s
[???] [???] but his bushy eyebrows [???] and his quick temper [???] and his voice . '
` you ' re right [???] ' said sam . ` and don ' t think i ' m finding fault . i ' ve
often wanted to see a bit of magic like what it tells of in old tales [???] but
i ' ve never heard of a better land than this . it ' s like being at home and on
a holiday at the same time [???] if you understand me . i don ' t want to leave . all

the same [???] i ' m beginning to feel that if we ' ve got to go on [???] then we ' d best
get it over .
' it ' s the job that ' s never started as takes longest to finish [???] as my
old [???] used to say . and i don ' t reckon that these folk can do much more
to help us [???] magic or no . it ' s when we leave this land that we shall miss
[???] worse [???] i ' m thinking . '
' i am afraid that ' s only too true [???] sam [???] ' said [???] . ` yet i hope very
much that before we leave we shall see the lady of the elves again . '
even as he spoke [???] they saw [???] as if she came in answer to their words [???]
the lady [???] approaching . tall and white and fair she walked beneath
the trees . she spoke no word [???] but beckoned to them .
turning aside [???] she led them toward the southern [???] of the hill of
caras [???] [???] and passing through a high green hedge they came into an
enclosed garden . no trees grew there [???] and it lay open to the sky . the
evening star had risen and was shining with white fire above the western
woods . down a long flight of steps the lady went into a deep green hollow [???]
through which ran murmuring the silver stream that issued from the fountain
on the hill . at the bottom [???] upon a low [???] carved like a branching
tree [???] stood a basin of silver . wide and shallow [???] and beside it stood a
si lver ewer .
with water from the stream [???] filled the basin to the brim [???] and
breathed on it [???] and when the water was still again she spoke . ` here is the
mirror of [???] [???] ' she said . ' i have brought you here so that you may
look in it [???] if you will . '
the air was very still [???] and the dell was dark [???] and the elf - lady beside
him was tall and pale . ' what shall we look for [???] and what shall we see ? '
asked [???] [???] filled with awe .
` many things i can command the mirror to reveal [???] ' she a [???] [???] ` and to
some i can show what they desire to see . but the mirror will also show
things [???] [???] and those are often stranger and more profitable than
things which we wish to behold . what you will see [???] if you leave the mirror
free to work [???] i cannot tell . for it shows things that were [???] and things that
are [???] things that yet may be . but which it is that he sees [???] even the wisest
cannot always tell . do you wish to look ? '
[???] did not answer .
` and you ? ' she said [???] turning to sam . ' for this is what your folk would
call magic . i believe ; though i do not understand clearly what they mean ;

and they seem also to use the same word of the deceits of the enemy . but
this [???] if you will [???] is the magic of [???] . did you not say that you
wished to see elf - magic ? '
' i did [???] ' said sam [???] trembling a little between fear and curiosity . ` i ' ll
have a peep [???] lady [???] if you ' re willing . '
` and i ' d not mind a glimpse of what ' s going on at home [???] ' he said in an
aside to [???] . ' it seems a terrible long time that i ' ve been away . but
there [???] like as not i ' ll only see the stars [???] or something that i won ' t
understand . '
' like as not [???] ' said the lady with a gentle laugh . ` but come [???] you shall
look and see what you may . do not touch the water ! '
sam climbed up on the foot of the [???] and leaned over the basin .
the water looked hard and dark . stars were reflected in it .
` there ' s only stars [???] as i thought [???] ' he said . then he gave a low gasp [???]
for the stars went out . as if a dark veil had been withdrawn [???] the mirror
grew grey [???] and then clear . there was sun shining [???] and the branches of trees
were waving and tossing in the wind . but before sam could make up his mind
what it was that he saw [???] the light faded ; and now he thought he saw [???]
with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff . then he seemed
to see himself going along a dim passage [???] and climbing an endless winding
stair . it came to him suddenly that he was looking urgently for something [???]
but what it was he did not know . like a dream the vision shifted and went
back [???] and he saw the trees again . but this time they were not so close [???] and
he could see what was going on : they were not waving in the wind [???] they were
falling [???] [???] to the ground .
` hi ! ' cried sam in an outraged voice . ' there ' s that ted sandyman
a - cutting down trees as he shouldn ' t . they didn ' t ought to be felled : it ' s
that avenue beyond the mill that shades the road to bywater . i wish i could
get at ted [???] and i ' d fell him ! '
but now sam noticed that the old mill had vanished [???] and a large
red - brick building was being put up where it had stood . lots of folk were
busily at work . there was a tall red chimney nearby . black smoke seemed to
cloud the surface of the mirror .
' there ' s some devilry at work in the shire [???] ' he said . ' [???] knew what
he was about when he wanted to send mr . merry back . ' then suddenly sam
gave
a cry and sprang away . ' i can ' t stay here [???] ' he said wildly . ` i must go home .

they ' ve dug up [???] row [???] and there ' s the poor old [???] going down the
hill with his bits of things on a barrow . i must go home ! '
' you cannot go home alone [???] ' said the lady . ' you did not wish to go home
without your master before you looked in the mirror [???] and yet you knew that
evil things might well be happening in the shire . remember that the mirror
shows many things [???] and not all have yet come to pass . some never come to be [???]
unless those that behold the visions turn aside from their path to prevent
them . the mirror is dangerous as a guide of deeds . '
sam sat on the ground and put his head in his hands . ` i wish i had
never come here [???] and i don ' t want to see no more magic [???] ' he said and fell
silent . after a moment he spoke again thickly [???] as if struggling with tears .
` no [???] i ' ll go home by the long road with mr . [???] [???] or not at all [???] ' he said .
` but i hope i do get back some day . if what i ' ve seen turns out true [???]
somebody ' s going to catch it hot ! '
` do you now wish to look [???] [???] ? ' said the lady [???] . ` you did
not wish to see elf - magic and were content . '
` do you advise me to look ? ' asked [???] .
' no [???] ' she said . ` i do not counsel you one way or the other . i am not a
counsellor . you may learn something [???] a nd whether what you see be fair or
evil [???] that may be profitable [???] and yet it may not . seeing is both good and
perilous . yet i think [???] [???] [???] that you have courage and wisdom enough for
the venture [???] or i would not have brought you here . do as you will ! '
` i will look [???] ' said [???] [???] and he climbed on the [???] and bent over
the dark water . at once the mirror cleared and he saw a [???] land .
mountains loomed dark in the distance against a pale sky . a long grey road
wound back out of sight . far away a figure came slowly down the road [???] faint
and small at first [???] but growing larger and clearer as it approached .
suddenly [???] realized that it reminded him of [???] . he almost called
aloud the [???] ' s name [???] and then he saw that the figure was clothed not in
grey but in white [???] in a white that shone faintly in the [???] ; and in its
hand there was a white staff . the head was so bowed that he could see no
face [???] and presently the figure turned aside round a bend in the road and
went out of the mirror ' s view . doubt came into [???] ' s mind : was this a
vision of [???] on one of his many lonely journeys long ago [???] or was it
[???] ?
the vision now changed . brief and small but very vivid he caught a
glimpse of [???] walking restlessly about his room . the table was littered

with disordered papers ; rain was beating on the windows .
then there was a pause [???] and after it many swift scenes followed that
[???] in some way knew to be parts of a great history in which he had become
involved . the mist cleared and he saw a sight which he had never seen before
but knew at once : the sea . darkness fell . the sea rose and raged in a great
storm . then he saw against the sun [???] sinking blood - red into a wrack of
clouds [???] the black outline of a tall ship with torn sails riding up out of
the west . then a wide river flowing through a populous city . then a white
fortress with seven towers . and then again a ship with black sails [???] but now
it was morning again [???] and the water rippled with light [???] and a banner bearing
the [???] of a white tree shone in the sun . a smoke as of fire and battle
arose [???] and again the sun went down in a burning red that faded into a grey
mist ; and into the mist a small ship passed away [???] [???] with lights . it
vanished [???] and [???] sighed and prepared to draw away .
but suddenly the mirror went altogether dark [???] as dark as if a hole had
opened in the world of sight [???] and [???] looked into emptiness . in the black
[???] there appeared a single eye that slowly grew . until it filled nearly
all the mirror . so terrible was it that [???] stood rooted [???] unable to cry
out or to withdraw his gaze . the eye was [???] with fire [???] but was itself
[???] [???] yellow as a cat ' s [???] watchful and intent [???] and the black slit of its
pupil opened on a pit [???] a window into nothing .
then the eye began to rove [???] searching this way and that ; and [???] knew
with certainty and horror that among the many things that it sought he
himself was one . but he also knew that it could not see him - not yet [???] not
unless he willed it . the ring that hung upon its chain about his neck grew
heavy [???] heavier than a great stone [???] and his head was dragged downwards . the
mirror seemed to be growing hot and curls of steam were rising from the
water . he was slipping forward .
` do not touch the water ! ' said the lady [???] softly . the vision
faded [???] and [???] found that he was looking at the cool stars [???] in
the silver basin . he stepped back shaking all over and looked at the lady .
` i know what it was that you last saw [???] ' she said ; ` for that is also in
my mind . do not be afraid ! but do not think that only by singing amid the
trees [???] nor even by the slender arrows of elven - bows [???] is this land of
[???] maintained and defended against its enemy . i say to you [???] [???] [???]
that even as i speak to you [???] i perceive the dark lord and know his mind [???] or
all of his mind that concerns the elves . and he gropes ever to see me and my

thought . but still the door is closed ! '
she lifted up her white arms [???] and spread out her hands towards the east
in a gesture of rejection and denial . [???] [???] the evening star [???] most
beloved of the elves [???] shone clear above . so bright was it that the figure of
the elven - lady cast a dim shadow on the ground . its rays glanced upon a ring
about her finger ; it glittered like polished gold [???] with silver
light [???] and a white stone in it [???] as if the even - star had come down to
rest upon her hand . [???] gazed at the ring with awe ; for suddenly it seemed
to him that he understood .
` yes [???] ' she said [???] divining his thought [???] ` it is not permitted to speak of
it [???] and [???] could not do so . but it cannot be hidden from the
ring - bearer [???] and one who has seen the eye . verily it is in the land of
[???] upon the finger of [???] that one of the three remains . this is
[???] [???] the ring of adamant [???] and i am its keeper .
` he suspects [???] but he does not know - - not yet . do you not see now
wherefore your coming is to us as the footstep of doom ? for if you fail [???]
then we are laid bare to the enemy . yet if you succeed [???] then our power is
diminished [???] and [???] will fade [???] and the tides of time will sweep it
away . we must depart into the west [???] or [???] to a rustic folk of dell and
cave [???] slowly to forget and to be forgotten . '
[???] bent his head . ` and what do you wish ? ' he said at last .
` that what should be shall be [???] ' she answered . ` the love of the elves
for their land a nd their works is deeper than the deeps of the sea [???] and
their regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be [???] . yet they will
cast all away rather than submit to [???] : for they know him now . for the
fate of [???] you are not answerable but only for the doing of your own
task . yet i could wish [???] were it of any avail [???] that the one ring had never
been wrought [???] or had remained for ever lost . '
' you are wise and fearless and fair [???] lady [???] [???] ' said [???] . ` i
will give you the one ring [???] if you ask for it . it is too great a matter for
me . '
[???] laughed with a sudden clear laugh . ` wise the lady [???]
may be [???] ' she said [???] ` yet here she has met her match in courtesy . gently are
you revenged for my testing of your heart at our first meeting . you begin to
see with a keen eye . i do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask
what you offer . for many long years i had pondered what i might do [???] should
the great ring come into my hands [???] and behold ! it was brought within my

grasp . the evil that was devised long ago works on in many ways [???] whether
[???] himself stands or falls . would not that have been a noble deed to set
to the credit of his ring [???] if i had taken it by force or fear from my guest ?
` and now a t last it comes . you will give me the ring freely ! in place
of the dark lord you will set up a queen . and i shall not be dark [???] but
beautiful and terrible as the morning and the night ! fair as the sea and the
sun and the snow upon the mountain ! drea dful as the storm and the
lightning !
stronger than the foundations of the earth . all shall love me and despair ! '
she lifted up her hand and from the ring that she wore there issued a
great light that [???] her alone and left all else dark . she stood
before [???] seeming now tall beyond measurement [???] and beautiful beyond
enduring [???] terrible and worshipful . then she let her hand fall [???] and the light
faded [???] and suddenly she laughed again [???] and lo ! she was [???] : a slender
elf - woman [???] clad in simple white [???] whose gentle voice was soft and sad .
' i pass the test [???] ' she said . ` i will diminish [???] and go into the west and
remain [???] . '
they stood for a long while in silence . at length the lady spoke again .
` let us return ! ' she said . ` in the morning you must depart for now we have
chosen [???] and the tides of fate are flowing . '
` i would ask one thing before we go [???] ' said [???] [???] ` a thing which i
often meant to ask [???] in [???] . i am permitted to wear the one
ring : why cannot i see all the others and know the thoughts of those that
wear them ? '
` you have not tried [???] ' she said . ` only thrice have you set the ring upon
your finger since you knew what you possessed . do not try ! it would destroy
you . did not ganda lf tell you that the rings give power according to the
measure of each possessor ? before you could use that power you would need
to
become far stronger [???] and to train your will to the domination of others . yet
even so [???] as ring - bearer and as one that has borne it on finger and seen that
which is hidden [???] your sight is grown keener . you have perceived my thought
more clearly than many that are accounted wise . you saw the eye of him that
holds the seven and the nine . and did you not see and recognize the ring
upon my finger ? did you see my ring ? ' she asked turning again to sam .
' no [???] lady [???] ' he answered . ` to tell you the truth [???] i wondered what you
were talking about . i saw a star through your finger . but if you ' ll pardon

my speaking out [???] i think my master was right . i wish you ' d take his ring .
you ' d put things to rights . you ' d stop them digging up the [???] and
turning him [???] . you ' d make some folk pay for their dirty work . '
` i would [???] ' she said . ` that is how it would begin . bu t it would not stop
with that [???] alas ! we will not speak more of it . let us go ! '




chapter 8 . farewell to [???]



that night the company was again summoned to the chamber of [???] [???]
and there the lord and lady greeted them with fair words . at length [???]
spoke of their departure .
` now is the time [???] ' he said [???] ` when those who wish to continue the quest
must harden their hearts to leave this land . those who no longer wish to go
forward may remain here [???] for a while . but whether they stay or go [???] none can
be sure of peace . for we are come now to the edge of doom . here those who
wish may [???] the [???] of the hour till either the ways of the world
lie open again . or we summon them to the last need of [???] . then they may
return to their own lands [???] or else go to the long home of those that fall in
battle . '
there was a silence . ` they all resolved to go forward [???] ' said [???]
looking in their eyes .
` as for me [???] ' said [???] [???] ` my way home lies onward and not back . '
` that is true [???] ' said [???] [???] ` but is all this company going with you
to minas [???] ? '
` we have not decided our course [???] ' said [???] . ' beyond [???] i do
not know what [???] intended to do . indeed i do not think that even he had
any clear purpose . '
` maybe not [???] ' said [???] [???] ` yet when you leave this land [???] you can no
longer forget the great river . as some of you know well [???] it cannot be
crossed by travellers with [???] between [???] and [???] [???] save by boat .
and are not the bridges of [???] broken down and all the landings held
now by the enemy ?
` on which side will you journey ? the way to minas [???] lies upon this
side [???] upon the west ; but the straight road of the quest lies east of the
river [???] upon the darker shore . which shore will you now take ? '
` if my advice is heeded [???] it will be the western shore [???] and the way to
minas [???] [???] ' answered [???] . ` but i am not the leader of the company . '
the others said nothing [???] and [???] looked doubtful and troubled .
` i see that you do not yet know what to do [???] ' said [???] . ` it is not
my part to choose for you ; but i will help you as i may . there are some

among you who can handle boats : legolas [???] whose folk know the swift forest
river ; and [???] of [???] ; and [???] the traveller . '
` and one hobbit ! ' cried merry . ` not all of us look on boats as wild
horses . my people live by the banks of the [???] . '
` that is well [???] ' said [???] . ` then i will furnish your company with
boats . they must be small and light [???] for if you go far by water [???] there are
places where you will be forced to carry them . you will come to the rapids
of sarn [???] [???] and maybe at last to the great falls of [???] where the
river thunders down from nen [???] ; and there are other perils . boats may
make your journey less toilsome for a while . yet they will not give you
counsel : in the end you must leave them and the river [???] and turn west - or
east . '
[???] thanked [???] many times . the gift of boats comforted him
much [???] not least because there would now be no need to decide his course for
some days . the others [???] too [???] looked more hopeful . whatever perils lay ahead [???]
it seemed better to float down the broad tide of [???] to meet them than to
plod forward with bent backs . only sam was doubtful : he at any rate still
thought boats as bad as wild horses [???] or worse [???] and not all the dangers that
he had survived made him think better of them .
` all shall be prepared for you and [???] you at the haven before noon
tomorrow [???] ' said [???] . ' i will send my people to you in the morning to
help you make ready for the journey . now we will wish you all a fair night
and [???] sleep . '
' good night [???] my friends ! ' said [???] . ' sleep in peace ! do not
trouble your hearts [???] with thought of the road tonight . maybe the
paths that you each shall tread are already laid before your feet [???] though
you do not see them . good night ! '
the company now took their leave and returned to their [???] .
legolas went with them [???] for this was to be their last night in [???] [???]
and in spite of the words of [???] they wished to take counsel together .
for a long time they debated what they should do [???] and how it would be
best to attempt the fulfilling of their purpose with the ring : but they came
to no decision . it was plain that most of them desired to go first to minas
[???] [???] and to escape at least for a while from the terror of the enemy .
they would have been willing to follow a leader over the river and into the
shadow of [???] ; but [???] spoke no word [???] and [???] was still divided in
his mind .

his own plan [???] while [???] remained with them [???] had been to go with
[???] [???] and with his sword help to deliver [???] . for he believed that the
message of the dreams was a summons [???] and that the hour had come at last
when
the heir of [???] should come forth and strive with [???] for the
mastery . but in moria the burden of [???] had been laid on him ; and he
knew that he could not now forsake the ring [???] if [???] refused in the end to
go with [???] . and yet what help could he or any of the company give to
[???] [???] save to walk blindly with him into the darkness ?
` i shall go to minas [???] [???] alone if need be [???] for it is my duty [???] ' said
[???] ; and after that he was silent for a while [???] sitting with his eyes
fixed on [???] [???] as if he was trying to read the halfling ' s thoughts . at
length he spoke again [???] softly [???] as if he was debating with himself . ` if you
wish only to destroy the ring [???] ' he said [???] ` then there is little use in war
and weapons ; and the men of minas [???] cannot help . but if you wish to
destroy the armed might of the dark lord [???] then it is folly to go without
force into his domain ; and folly to throw away . ' he paused suddenly [???] as if
he had become aware that he was speaking his thoughts aloud . ` it would be
folly to throw lives away [???] i mean [???] ' he ended . ` it is a choice between
defending a strong place and walking openly into the arms of death . at
least [???] that is how i see it . '
[???] caught something new and strange in [???] ' s glance [???] and he
looked hard at him . plainly [???] ' s thought was different from his final
words . it would be folly to throw away : what ? the ring of power ? he had said
something like this at the council [???] but then he had accepted the correction
of [???] . [???] looked at [???] [???] but he seemed deep in his own thought
and made no sign that he had heeded [???] ' s wor ds . and so their debate
ended . merry and [???] were already asleep [???] and sam was nodding . the
night
was growing old .
in the morning [???] as they were beginning to pack their slender goods [???]
elves that could speak their tongue came to them and brought them many gifts
of food and clothing for the journey . the food was mostly in the form of
very thin cakes [???] made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the outside [???]
and inside was the colour of cream . [???] took up one of the cakes and
looked at it with a doubtful eye .
` cram [???] ' he said under his breath [???] as he broke off a crisp corner and

[???] at it . his expression quickly changed [???] and he ate all the rest of
the cake with relish .
` no more [???] no more ! ' cried the elves laughing . ` you have eaten enough
already for a long day ' s march . '
` i thought it was only a kind of cram [???] such as the dale - men make for
journeys in the wild [???] ' said the dwarf .
` so it is [???] ' they answered . ` but we call it [???] or [???] [???] and it
is mor e strengthening than any food made by men [???] and it is more pleasant
than cram [???] by all accounts . '
` indeed it is [???] ' said [???] . ' why it is better than the honey - cakes of
the [???] [???] and that is great praise [???] for the [???] are the best
bakers that i know of ; but they are none too willing to deal out their cakes
to travellers in these days . you are kindly hosts ! '
' all the same [???] we bid you spare the food [???] ' they said . ' eat little at a
time [???] and only at need . for these things are given to serve you when all
else fails . the cakes will keep sweet for many many days [???] if they are
[???] and left in their leaf - [???] [???] as we have brought them . one will
keep a traveller on his feet for a day of long labour [???] even if he be one of
the tall men of minas [???] . '
the elves next [???] and gave to each of the company the clothes
they had brought . for each they had provided a hood and cloak [???] made
according to his size [???] of the light but warm silken stuff that the [???]
wove . it was hard to say of what colour they were : grey with the hue of
[???] under the trees they seemed to be ; and yet if they were moved [???] or
set in another light [???] they were green as shadowed leaves [???] or brown as fallow
fields by night [???] [???] - silver as water under the stars . each cloak was
fastened about the neck with a brooch like a green leaf veined with silver .
` are these magic cloaks ? ' asked [???] [???] looking at them with wonder .
` i do not know what you mean by that [???] ' answered the leader of the
elves . ` they are fair garments [???] and the web is good [???] for it was made in this
land . they are elvish robes certainly [???] if that is what you mean . leaf and
branch [???] water and stone : they have the hue and beauty of all these things
under the [???] of [???] that we love ; for we put the thought of all
that we love into all that we make . yet they are garments [???] not armour [???] and
they will not turn shaft or blade . but they should serve you well : they are
light to wear [???] and warm enough or cool enough at need . and you will find
them a great aid in keeping out of the sight of [???] eyes [???] whether you

walk among the stones or the trees . you are indeed high in the favour of the
lady ! for she herself and her maidens wove this stuff ; and never before have
we clad strangers in the garb of our own people . '
after their morning meal the company said farewell to the lawn by the
fountain . their hearts were heavy ; for it was a fair place [???] and it had
become like home to them [???] though they could not count the days and nights
that they had passed there . as they stood for a moment looking at the white
water in the sunlight [???] [???] came walking towards them over the green grass
of the glade . [???] greeted him with delight .
' i have returned from the northern fences [???] ' said the elf [???] ` and i am
sent now to be your guide again . the [???] dale is full of vapour and
clouds of smoke [???] and the mountains are troubled . there are noises in the
deeps of the earth . if any of you had thought of returning northwards to
your homes [???] you would not have been able to pass that way . but come ! your
path now goes south . '
as they walked through caras [???] the green ways were empty ; but in
the trees above them many voices were murmuring and singing . they
themselves
went silently . at last [???] led them down the southward [???] of the
hill [???] and they came again to the great gate hung with lamps [???] and to the
white bridge ; and so they passed out and left the city of the elves . then
they turned away from the paved road and took a path that went off into a
deep thicket of mallorn - trees [???] and passed on [???] winding through rolling
[???] of silver shadow [???] leading them ever down [???] southwards and
eastwards [???] towards the shores of the river .
they had gone some ten miles and noon was at hand when they came on a
high green wall . passing through an opening they came suddenly out of the
trees . before them lay a long lawn of shining grass [???] studded with golden
elanor that glinted in the sun . the lawn ran out into a narrow tongue
between bright margins : on the right and west the [???] flowed
glittering ; on the left and east the great river rolled its broad waters [???]
deep and dark . on the further shores the [???] still marched on
southwards as far as the eye could see [???] but all the banks were bleak and
bare . no mallorn lifted its gold - hung boughs beyond the land of [???] .
on the bank of the [???] [???] at some distance up from the meeting of
the streams [???] there was a hythe of white stones and white wood . by it were
moored many boats and barges . some were brightly painted [???] and shone with

silver and gold and green [???] but most were either white or grey . three small
grey boats had been made ready for the travellers [???] and in these the elves
stowed their goods . and they added also coils of rope [???] three to each boat .
slender they looked [???] but strong [???] silken to the touch [???] grey of hue like the
elven - cloaks .
` what are these ? ' asked sam [???] handling one that lay upon the
[???] .
` ropes indeed ! ' answered an elf from the boats . ' never travel far
without a rope ! and one that is long and strong and light . such are these .
they may be a help in many needs . '
' you don ' t need to tell me that ! ' said sam . ` i came without any and
i ' ve been worried ever since . but i was wondering what these were made of [???]
knowing a bit about rope - making : it ' s in the family as you might say . '
` they are made of [???] [???] ' said the elf [???] ` but there is no time now to
instruct you in the art of their making . had we known that this craft
delighted you [???] we could have taught you much . but now alas ! unless you
should at some time return hither [???] you must be content with our gift . may it
serve you well ! '
` come ! ' said [???] . ` all is now ready for you . enter the boats ! but
take care at first ! '
' heed the words ! ' said the other elves . ' these boats are light - built [???]
and they are crafty and unlike the boats of other folk . they will not sink [???]
lade them as you will ; but they are wayward if [???] . it would be wise
if you accustomed yourselves to stepping in and out [???] here where there is a
landing - place [???] before you set off [???] . '
the company was arranged in this way : [???] [???] [???] [???] and sam were in
one boat ; [???] [???] merry [???] and [???] in another ; and in the third were
legolas and [???] [???] who had now become fast friends . in this last boat most
of the goods and packs were stowed . the boats were moved and steered with
short - handled [???] that had broad leaf - shaped blades . when all was ready
[???] led them on a trial up the [???] . the current was swift and
they went forward slowly . sam sat in the bows [???] clutching the sides [???] and
looking back [???] to the shore . the sunlight glittering on the water
dazzled his eyes . as they passed beyond the green field of the tongue [???] the
trees drew down to the river ' s brink . here and there golden lea ves tossed
and floated on the [???] stream . the air was very bright and still [???] and
there was a silence [???] except for the high distant song of larks .

they turned a sharp bend in the river [???] and there [???] sailing proudly down
the stream toward them [???] they saw a swan of great size . the water rippled on
either side of the white breast beneath its curving neck . its beak shone
like burnished gold [???] and its eyes glinted like jet set in yellow stones ; its
huge white wings were half lifted . a music came down the river as it drew
nearer ; and suddenly they perceived that it was a ship [???] wrought and carved
with elven - skill in the likeness of a bird . two elves clad in white steered
it with black [???] . in the midst of the vessel sat [???] [???] and behind
him stood [???] [???] tall and white ; a circlet of golden flowers was in her
hair [???] and in her hand she held a harp [???] and she sang . sad and sweet was the
sound of her voice in the cool clear air :
i sang of leaves [???] of leaves of gold [???] and leaves of gold there grew :
of wind i sang [???] a wind there came and in the branches blew .
beyond the sun [???] beyond the moon [???] the foam was on the sea [???]
and by the strand of [???] there grew a golden tree .
beneath the stars of ever - eve in [???] it shone [???]
in [???] beside the walls of elven tirion .
there long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching years [???]
while here beyond the sundering seas now fall the elven - tears .
o [???] ! the winter comes [???] the bare and leafless day ;
the leaves are falling in the stream [???] the river flows away .
o [???] ! too long i have dwelt upon this hither shore
and in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor .
but if of ships i now should sing [???] what ship would come to me [???]
what ship would bear me ever back across so wide a sea ?
[???] stayed his boat as the swan - ship drew alongside . the lady ended
her song and greeted them . ` we have come to bid you our last farewell [???] ' she
said [???] ` and to speed you with blessings from our land . '
` though you have been our guests [???] ' said [???] [???] ` you have not yet
eaten with us [???] and we bid you [???] therefore [???] to a parting feast [???] here between
the flowing waters that will bear you far from [???] . '
the swan passed on slowly to the hythe [???] and they turned their boats and
followed it . there in the last end of [???] upon the green grass the
parting feast was held ; but [???] ate and drank little [???] heeding only the
beauty of the lady and her voice . she seemed no longer perilous or terrible [???]
nor filled with hidden power . already she seemed to him [???] as by men of later
days elves still at times are seen : present and yet remote [???] a living vision

of that which has already been left far behind by the flowing streams of
time .
after they had eaten and drunk [???] sitting upon the grass [???] [???] spoke
to them again of their journey [???] and lifting his hand he pointed south to the
woods beyond the tongue .
` as you go down the water [???] ' he said [???] ` you will find that the trees will
fail [???] and you will come to a barren country . there the river flows in stony
vale amid high moors [???] until at last after many leagues it comes to the tall
island of the [???] [???] that we call tol brandir . there it casts its arms
about the steep shores of the isle [???] and falls then with a great noise and
smoke over the [???] of [???] down into the [???] [???] the [???] as it
is called in your tongue . that is a wide region of [???] fen where the
stream becomes tortuous and much divided . there the [???] flows in by
many
mouths from the forest of fangorn in the west . about that stream [???] on this
side of the great river [???] lies [???] . on the further side are the bleak hills
of the emyn muil . the wind blows from the east there [???] for they look out over
the dead marshes and the noman - lands to [???] [???] and the black gates of
[???] .
' [???] [???] and any that go with him seeking minas [???] [???] will do well
to leave the great river above [???] and cross the [???] before it finds
the marshes . yet they should not go too far up that stream [???] nor risk
becoming entangled in the forest of fangorn . that is a strange land [???] and is
now little known . but [???] and [???] doubtless do not need this
warning . '
' indeed we have heard of fangorn in minas [???] [???] ' said [???] . ` but
what i have heard seems to me for the most part old wives ' tales [???] such as we
tell to our children . all that lies north of [???] is now to us so far away
that fancy can wander freely there . of old fangorn lay upon the borders of
our realm ; but it is now many lives of men since any of us visited it [???] to
prove or [???] the [???] that have come down from distant years .
` i have myself been at whiles in [???] [???] but i have never crossed it
northwards . when i was sent out as a messenger [???] i passed through the gap by
the skirts of the white mountains [???] and crossed the isen and the [???]
into [???] . a long and [???] journey . four hundred leagues i
reckoned it [???] and it took me many months ; for i lost my horse at [???] [???] at
the fording of the [???] . after that journey [???] and the road i have

trodden with this company [???] i do not much doubt that i shall find a way
through [???] [???] and fangorn too [???] if need be . '
` then i need say no more [???] ' said [???] . ' but do not despise the lore
that has come down from distant years ; for oft it may chance that old wives
keep in memory word of things that once were needful for the wise to know . '
now [???] rose from the grass [???] and taking a cup from one of her
maidens she filled it with white mead and gave it to [???] .
' now it is time to drink the cup of farewell [???] ' she said . ` drink [???] lord
of the [???] ! and let not your heart be sad though night must follow
noon [???] and already our evening draweth nigh . '
then she brought the cup to each of the company [???] and bade them drink
and farewell . but when they had drunk she commanded them to sit again on the
grass [???] and chairs were set for her and for [???] . her maidens stood
silent about her [???] and a while she looked upon her guests . at last she spoke
again .
' we have drunk the cup of parting [???] ' she said [???] ` and the shadows fall
between us . but before you go [???] i have brought in my ship gifts which the
lord and lady of the [???] now offer you in memory of [???] . '
then
she called to each in turn .
` here is the gift of [???] and [???] to the leader of your
company [???] ' she said to [???] [???] and she gave him a sheath that had been made
to fit his sword . it was [???] with a tracery of flowers and leaves
wrought of silver and gold [???] and on it were set in elven runes formed of many
gems the name and [???] ril and the lineage of the sword .
` the blade that is drawn from this sheath shall not be stained or
broken even in defeat [???] ' she said . ` but is there aught else that you desire
of me at our parting ? for darkness will flow between us [???] and it may be that
we shall not meet again [???] unless it be far hence upon a road that has no
returning . '
and [???] answered : ' lady [???] you know all my desire [???] and long held in
keeping the only treasure that i seek . yet it is not yours to give me [???] even
if you would ; and only through darkness shall i come to it . '
` yet maybe this will lighten your heart [???] ' said [???] ; ` for it was
left in my care to be given to you [???] should you pass through this land . ' then
she lifted from her lap a great stone of a clear green [???] set in a silver
brooch that was wrought in the likeness of an eagle with [???] wings ;

and as she held it up the gem flashed like the sun shining through the
leaves of spring . ` this stone i gave to [???] my daughter [???] and she to
hers ; and now it comes to you as a token of hope . in this hour take the name
that was foretold for you [???] [???] [???] the [???] of the house of [???] ! '
then [???] took the stone and pinned the brooch upon his breast [???] and
those who saw him wondered ; for they had not marked before how tall and
kingly he stood [???] and it seemed to them that many years of toil had fallen
from his shoulders . ` for the gifts that you have given me i thank you [???] ' he
said [???] ' o lady of [???] of whom were sprung [???] and [???]
[???] .
what praise could i say more ? '
the lady bowed her hea d [???] and she turned then to [???] [???] and to him she
gave a belt of gold ; and to merry and [???] she gave small silver belts [???]
each with a clasp wrought like a golden flower . to legolas she gave a bow
such as the [???] used [???] longer and stouter than the bows of [???] [???]
and strung with a string of elf - hair . with it went a quiver of arrows .
` for you little gardener and lover of trees [???] ' she said to sam [???] ` i have
only a small gift . ' she put into his hand a little box of plain grey wood [???]
[???] save for a single silver rune upon the lid . ` here is set g for
[???] [???] ' she said ; ` but also it may stand for garden in your tongue . in
this box there is earth from my orchard [???] and such blessing as [???] has
still to bestow is upon it . it will not keep you on your road [???] nor defend
you against any peril ; but if you keep it and see your home again at last [???]
then perhaps it may reward you . though you should find all barren and laid
waste [???] there will be few gardens in middle - earth that will bloom like your
garden [???] if you [???] this earth there . then you may remember [???] [???]
and catch a glimpse far off of [???] [???] that you have seen only in our
winter . for our spring and our summer are gone by [???] and they will never be
seen on earth again save in memory . '
sam went red to the ears and muttered something [???] [???] as he
clutched the box and bowed as well as he could .
` and what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves ? ' said [???] turning
to [???] .
` none [???] lady [???] ' answered [???] . ` it is enough for me to have seen the
lady of the [???] [???] and to have heard her gentle words . '
` hear all ye elves ! ' she cried to those about her . ` let none say again
that [???] are grasping and [???] ! yet surely [???] [???] son of [???] [???]

you desire something that i could give ? name it [???] i bid you ! you shall not be
the only guest without a gift . '
` there is nothing [???] lady [???] [???] ' said [???] [???] bowing low and
[???] . ` nothing [???] unless it might be - unless it is permitted to ask . nay [???]
to name a single strand of your hair [???] which [???] the gold of the earth
as the stars surpass the gems of the mine . i do not ask for such a gift . but
you commanded me to name my desire . '
the elves stirred and murmured with astonishment [???] and [???] gazed at
the dwarf in wonder [???] but the lady smiled . ' it is said that the skill of the
[???] is in their hands rather than in their tongues ' she said ; ` yet that
is not true of [???] . for none have ever made to me a request so bold and
yet so courteous . and how shall i refuse [???] since i commanded him to speak ?
but tell me [???] what would you do with such a gift ? '
` treasure it [???] lady [???] ' he answered [???] ` in memory of your words to me at our
first meeting . and if ever i return to the smithies of my home [???] it shall be
set in [???] crystal to be an [???] of my house [???] and a pledge of
good will between the mountain and the wood until the end of days . '
then the lady [???] one of her long tresses [???] and cut o ff three
golden hairs [???] and laid them in [???] ' s hand . ` these words shall go with the
gift [???] ' she said . ` i do not foretell [???] for all [???] is now vain : on the
one hand lies darkness [???] and on the other only hope . but if hope should not
fail [???] then i sa y to you [???] [???] son of [???] [???] that your hands shall flow with
gold [???] and yet over you gold shall have no dominion .
` and you [???] ring - bearer [???] ' she said [???] turning to [???] . ` i come to you last
who are not last in my thoughts . for you i have prepared this . ' she held up
a small crystal phial : it glittered as she moved it [???] and rays of white light
sprang from her hand . ' in this phial [???] ' she said [???] ` is caught the light of
[???] ' s star [???] set amid the waters of my fountain . it will shine still
brighter when night is about you . may it be a light to you in dark places [???]
when all other lights go out . remember [???] and her mirror ! '
[???] took the phial [???] and for a moment as it shone between them [???] he saw
her again standing like a queen [???] great and beautiful [???] but no longer
terrible . he bowed [???] but found no words to say .
now the lady arose [???] and [???] led them back to the hythe . a yellow
noon lay on the green land of the tongue [???] and the water glittered with
silver . all at last was made ready . the company took their places in the
boats as before . crying farewell [???] the elves of [???] with long grey poles

thrust them out into the flowing stream [???] and the [???] waters bore them
slowly away . the travellers sat still without moving or speaking . on the
green bank near to the very point of the tongue the lady [???] stood
alone and silent . as they passed her they turned and their eyes watched her
slowly floating away from them . for so it seemed to them : [???] was
slipping backward [???] like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees [???] sailing
on to forgotten shores [???] while they sat helpless upon the margin of the grey
and leafless world .
even as they gazed [???] the [???] passed out into the currents of the
great river [???] and their boats turned and began to speed southwards . soon the
white form of the lady was small and distant . she shone like a window of
glass upon a far hill in the westering sun [???] or as a remote lake seen from a
mountain : a crystal fallen in the lap of the land . then it seemed to [???]
that she lifted her arms in a final farewell [???] and far but piercing - clear on
the following wind came the sound of her voice singing . but now she sang in
the ancient tongue of the elves beyond the sea [???] and he did not understand
the words : fair was the music [???] but it did not comfort him .
yet as is the way of elvish words [???] they remained graven in his memory [???]
and long afterwards he interpreted them [???] as well as he could : the language
was that of elven - song and spoke of things little known on middle - earth .
ai ! lauril [???] [???] s [???] [???] [???]

[???] ! [???] [???] [???] .
[???] elyl [???] . [???] !
` ah ! like gold fall the leaves in the wind [???] long years numberless as
the wings of trees ! the long years have passed like swift draughts of the
sweet mead in lofty halls beyond the west [???] beneath the blue vaults of [???]
wherein the stars tremble in the song of her voice [???] holy and queenly . who
now shall refill the cup for me ? for now the kindler [???] [???] [???] the queen of
the stars [???] from mount [???] has [???] her hands like clouds [???] and all
paths are drowned deep in shadow ; and out of a grey country darkness lies on
the foaming waves between us [???] and mist covers the jewels of [???] for
ever . now lost [???] lost to those from the east is [???] ! farewell ! maybe thou
shalt find [???] . maybe even thou shalt find it . farewell ! ' [???] is the
name of that lady whom the elves in these lands of exile name [???] .
suddenly the river swept round a bend [???] and the banks rose upon either
side [???] and the light of [???] was hidden . to that fair land [???] never came
again .
the travellers now turned their faces to the journey ; the sun was
before them [???] and their eyes were dazzled [???] for all were filled with tears .
[???] wept openly .
` i have looked the last upon that which was fairest [???] ' he said to
legolas his companion . ` [???] i will call nothing fair [???] unless it be
her gift . ' he put his hand to his breast .
` tell me [???] legolas [???] why did i come on this quest ? little did i know
where the chief peril lay ! truly [???] spoke [???] saying that we could not
foresee what we might meet upon our road . torment in the dark was the danger
that i feared [???] and it did not hold me back . but i would not have come [???] had i
known the danger of light and joy . now i have taken my worst wound in this
parting [???] even if i were to go this night straight to the dark lord . alas for
[???] son of [???] ! '
` nay ! ' said legolas . ` alas for us all ! and for all that walk the world
in these after - days . for such is the way of it : to find and lose [???] as it
seems to those whose boat is on the running stream . but i count you blessed [???]
[???] son of [???] : for your loss you suffer of your own free will [???] and you
might have chosen otherwise . but you have not forsaken your companions [???]
and
the least reward that you shall have is that the memory of [???] shall
remain ever clear and unstained in your heart [???] and shall neither fade nor

grow stale . '
` maybe [???] ' said [???] ; ` and i thank you for your words . true words
doubtless ; yet all such comfort is cold . memory is not what the heart
desires . that is only a mirror [???] be it clear as [???] - [???] . or so says the
heart of [???] the dwarf . elves may see things otherwise . indeed i have
heard that for them memory is more like to the waking world than to a dream .
not so for [???] .
' but let us talk no more of it . look to the boat ! she is too low in the
water with all this [???] [???] and the great river is swift . i do not wish to
drown my grief in cold water . ' he took up a paddle [???] and steered towards the
western bank [???] following [???] ' s boat ahead [???] which had already moved out of
the middle stream .
so the company went on their long way [???] down the wide hurrying waters [???]
borne ever southwards . bare woods stalked along either bank [???] and they could
not see any glimpse of the lands behind . the breeze died away and the river
flowed without a sound . no voice of bird broke the silence . the sun grew
misty as the day grew old [???] until it gleamed in a pale sky like a high white
pearl . then it faded into the west [???] and [???] came early [???] followed by a grey
and starless night . far into the dark quiet hours they floated on [???] guiding
their boats under the [???] shadows of the western woods . great trees
passed by like ghosts [???] thrusting their twisted thirsty roots through the
mist down into the water . it was dreary and cold . [???] sat and listened to
the faint lap and [???] of the river fretting among the tree - roots and
[???] near the shore [???] until his head nodded and he fell into an uneasy
sleep .




chapter 9 . the great river



[???] was roused by sam . he found that he was lying [???] well wrapped [???]
under tall grey - skinned trees in a quiet corner of the [???] on the west
bank of the great river [???] [???] . he had slept the night away [???] and the grey
of morning was dim among the bare branches . [???] was busy with a small fire
near at hand .
they started again before the day was broad . not that most of the
company were eager to hurry southwards : they were content that the decision [???]
which they must make at latest when they came to [???] and the [???]
isle [???] still lay some days ahead ; and they let the river bear them on at its
own pace [???] having no desire to hasten towards the perils that lay beyond [???]
whichever course they took in the end . [???] let them drift with the
stream as they wished [???] husbanding their strength against weariness to come .
but he insisted that at least they should start early each day and journey
on far into the evening ; for he felt in his heart that time was pressing [???]
and he feared that the dark lord had not been idle while they lingered in
[???] .
nonetheless they saw no sign of an enemy that day [???] nor the next . the
dull grey hours passed without event . as the third day of their voyage wore
on the lands changed slowly : the trees thinned and then failed altogether .
on the eastern bank to their left they saw long formless [???] stretching
up and away toward the sky ; brown and withered they looked [???] as if fire had
passed over them [???] leaving no living blade of green : an [???] waste
without even a broken tree or a bold stone to relieve the emptiness . they
had come to the brown lands that lay [???] vast and desolate [???] between southern
[???] and the hills of the emyn muil . what pestilence or war or evil deed
of the enemy had so blasted all that region even [???] could not tell .
upon the west to their right the land was treeless also [???] but it was
flat [???] and in many places green with wide plains of grass . on this side of
the river they passed forests of great reeds [???] so tall that they shut out all
view to the west [???] as the little boats went rustling by along their
[???] borders . their dark withered plumes bent and tossed in the light
cold airs [???] hissing softly and sadly . here and there through openings [???]
could catch sudden [???] of rolling meads [???] and far beyond them hills in

the sunset [???] and away on the edge of sight a dark line [???] where marched the
[???] ranks of the misty mountains .
there was no sign of living moving things [???] save birds . of these there
were many : small fowl whistling and piping in the reeds [???] but they were
seldom seen . once or twice the travellers heard the rush and whine of
swan - wings [???] and looking up they saw a great [???] streaming along the sky .
` swans ! ' said sam . ` and mighty big ones too ! '
` yes [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and they are black swans . '
` how wide and empty and mournful all this country looks ! ' said [???] .
` i always imagined that as one journeyed south it got warmer and merrier [???]
until winter was left behind for ever . '
' but we have not journeyed far south yet [???] ' answered [???] . ` it is
still winter [???] and we are far from the sea . here the world is cold until the
sudden spring [???] and we may yet have snow again . far away down in the bay of
[???] [???] to which [???] runs [???] it is warm and merry [???] maybe [???] or would be but
for the enemy . but here we are not above sixty leagues [???] i guess [???] south of
the [???] away in your shire [???] hundreds of long miles yonder . you are
looking now south - west across the north plains of the [???] [???] [???] the
land of the horse - lords . ere long we shall come to the mouth of the limlight
that runs down from fangorn to join the great river . that is the north
boundary of [???] ; and of old all that lay between limlight and the white
mountains belonged to the [???] . it is a rich and pleasant land [???] and its
grass has no rival ; but in these evil days folk do not dwell by the river or
ride often to its shores . [???] is wide [???] yet the [???] can shoot their
arrows far across the stream ; and of late [???] it is said [???] they have dared to
cross the water and raid the herds and studs of [???] . '
sam looked from bank to bank [???] . the trees had seemed hostile
before [???] as if they harboured secret eyes and lurking dangers ; now he wished
that the trees were still there . he felt that the company was too naked [???]
[???] in little open boats in the midst of shelterless lands [???] and on a
river that was the frontier of war .
in the next day or two [???] as they went on [???] borne steadily southwards [???]
this feeling of [???] grew on all the company . for a whole day they
took to their [???] and hastened forward . the banks slid by . soon the
river broadened and grew more shallow ; long stony beaches lay upon the east [???]
and there were gravel - shoals in the water [???] so that careful steering was
needed . the brown lands rose into bleak wolds [???] over which flowed a chill air

from the east . on the other side the meads had become rolling downs of
withered grass [???] a land of fen and [???] . [???] shivered [???] thinking of
the lawns and fountains [???] the clear sun and gentle rains of [???] . there
was little speech and no laughter in any of the boats . each member of the
company was busy with his own thoughts .
the heart of legolas was running under the stars of a summer night in
some northern glade amid the beech - woods ; [???] was fingering gold in his
mind [???] and wondering if it were fit to be wrought into the [???] of the
lady ' s gift . merry and [???] in the middle boat were ill at ease [???] for
[???] sat muttering to himself [???] sometimes biting his nails [???] as if some
restlessness or doubt consumed him [???] sometimes seizing a paddle and driving
the boat close behind [???] ' s . then [???] [???] who sat in the bow looking
back [???] caught a queer gleam in his eye [???] as he peered forward gazing at [???] .
sam had long ago made up his mind that [???] though boats were maybe not as
dangerous as he had been brought up to believe [???] they were far more
uncomfortable than even he had imagined . he was [???] and miserable [???]
having nothing to do but stare at the winter - lands [???] by and the grey
water on either side of him . even when the [???] were in use they did not
trust sam with one .
as [???] drew down on the fourth day [???] he was looking back over the bowed
heads of [???] and [???] and the following boats ; he was drowsy and
longed
for camp and the feel of earth under his toes . suddenly something caught his
sight : at first he stared at it [???] [???] then he sat up and rubbed his
eyes ; but when he looked again he could not see it any more .
that night they camped on a small eyot close to the western bank . sam
lay rolled in blankets beside [???] . ` i had a funny dream an hour or two
before we stopped [???] mr . [???] [???] ' he said . ` or maybe it wasn ' t a dream . funny
it was anyway . '
` well [???] what was it ? ' said [???] [???] knowing that sam would not settle
down until he had told his tale [???] whatever it was . ' i haven ' t seen or thought
of anything to make me smile since we left [???] . '
` it wasn ' t funny that way [???] mr . [???] . it was queer . all wrong [???] if it
wasn ' t a dream . and you had best hear it . it was like this : i saw a log with
eyes ! '
` the log ' s all right [???] ' said [???] . ` there are many in the river . but
leave out the eyes ! '

` that i won ' t [???] ' said sam . ` ' twas the eyes as made me sit up [???] so to
speak . i saw what i took to be a log floating along in the half - light behind
[???] ' s boat ; but i didn ' t give much heed to it . then it seemed as if the
log was slowly catching us up . and that was peculiar [???] as you might say [???]
seeing as we were all floating on the stream together . just then i saw the
eyes : two pale sort of points [???] shiny - like [???] on a hump at the near end of the
log . what ' s more [???] it wasn ' t a log [???] for it had paddle - feet [???] like a swan ' s
almost [???] only they seemed bigger [???] and kept dipping in and out of the water .
' that ' s when i sat right up and rubbed my eyes [???] meaning to give a
shout [???] if it was still there when i had rubbed the drowse out of my head .
for the whatever - it - was was coming along fast now and getting close behind
[???] . but whether those two lamps spotted me moving and staring [???] or whether
i came to my senses [???] i don ' t know . when i looked again [???] it wasn ' t there . yet
i think i caught a glimpse with the tail of - my eye [???] as the saying is [???] of
something dark shooting under the shadow of the bank . i couldn ' t see no more
eyes though .
` i said to myself : [???] dreaming again [???] sam [???] [???] [???] i said : and i said no
more just then . but i ' ve been thinking since . and now i ' m not so sure . what
do you make of it [???] mr . [???] ? '
' i should make nothing of it but a log and the [???] and sleep in your
eyes sam [???] said [???] [???] if this was the first time that those eyes had been
seen . but it isn ' t . i saw them away back north before we reached [???] . and
i saw a strange creature with eyes climbing to the flet that night . [???]
saw it too . and do you remember the report of the elves that went after the
orc - band ? '
` ah [???] ' said sam . ` i do ; and i remember more too . i don ' t like my
thoughts ; but thinking of one thing and another [???] and mr . [???] ' s stories and
all [???] i fancy i could put a name on the creature [???] at a guess . a [???] name .
[???] [???] maybe ? '
` yes [???] that is what i have feared for some time [???] ' said [???] . ` ever
since the night on the flet . i suppose he was lurking in moria [???] and picked
up our trail then ; but i hoped that our stay in [???] would throw him off
the scent again . the miserable creature must have been hiding in the woods
by the [???] [???] watching us start off ! '
` that ' s about it [???] ' said sam . ` and we ' d better be a bit more watchful
ourselves [???] or we ' ll feel some [???] fingers round our necks one of these
nights [???] if we ever wake up to feel anything . and that ' s what i was leading

up to . no need to trouble strider or the others tonight . i ' ll keep watch . i
can sleep tomorrow [???] being no more than [???] in a boat [???] as you might say . '
` i might [???] ' said [???] [???] ` and i might say [???] [???] with eyes [???] . you shall
watch ; but only if you promise to wake me halfway towards morning [???] if
nothing happens before then . '
in the dead hours [???] came out of a deep dark sleep to find sam
shaking him . ` it ' s a shame to wake you [???] ' whispered sam [???] ` but that ' s what you
said . there ' s nothing to tell [???] or not much . i thought i heard some soft
[???] and a [???] noise [???] a while back ; but you hear a lot of such
queer sounds by a river at night . '
he lay down [???] and [???] sat up [???] [???] in his blankets [???] and fought off
his sleep . minutes or hours passed slowly [???] and nothing happened . [???] was
just yielding to the temptation to lie down again when a dark shape [???] hardly
visible [???] floated close to one of the moored boats . a long whitish hand could
be dimly seen as it shot out and [???] the [???] ; two pale lamplike eyes
shone coldly as they peered inside [???] and then they lifted and gazed up at
[???] on the eyot . they were not more than a yard or two away [???] and [???]
heard the soft hiss of intaken breath . he stood up [???] drawing sting from its
sheath [???] and faced the eyes . immediately their light was shut off . there was
another hiss and a splash [???] and the dark log - shape shot away [???] into
the night . [???] stirred in his sleep [???] turned over [???] and sat up `
' what is it ? ' he whispered [???] springing up and coming to [???] . ` i felt
something in my sleep . why have you drawn your sword ? '
` [???] [???] ' answered [???] . ' or at least [???] so i guess . '
` ah ! ' said [???] . ` so you know about our little [???] [???] do you ? he
padded after us all through moria and right down to [???] . since we took
to boats [???] he has been lying on a log and paddling with hands and feet . i
have tried to catch him once or twice at night ; but he is slier than a fox [???]
and a s slippery as a fish . i hoped the river - voyage would beat him [???] but he
is too clever a waterman .
` we shall have to try going faster tomorrow . you lie down now [???] and i
will keep watch for what is left of the night . i wish i could lay my hands
on the wretch . we might make him useful . but if i cannot [???] we shall have to
try and lose him . he is very dangerous . quite apart from murder by night on
his own account [???] he may put any enemy that is about on our track . '
the night passed without [???] showing so much as a shadow again .
after that the company kept a sharp look - out [???] but they saw no more of [???]

while the voyage lasted . if he was still following [???] he was very wary and
cunning . at [???] ' s bidding they [???] now for long spells [???] and the
banks went swiftly by . but they saw little of the country [???] for they
journeyed mostly by night and [???] [???] resting by day [???] and lying as hidden
as the land allowed . in this way the time passed without event until the
seventh day .
the weather was still grey and overcast [???] with wind from the east [???] but
as evening drew into night the sky away westward cleared [???] and [???] of faint
light [???] yellow and pale green [???] opened under the grey shores of cloud . there
the white rind of the new moon could be seen [???] in the remote lakes .
sam looked at it and puckered his brows .
the next day the country on either side began to change rapidly . the
banks began to rise and grow stony . soon they were passing through a hilly
rocky land [???] and on both shores there were steep [???] buried in deep brakes
of thorn and sloe [???] tangled with [???] and creepers . behind them stood low
crumbling cliffs [???] and chimneys of grey weathered stone dark with ivy ; and
beyond these again there rose high ridges crowned with wind - [???] firs .
they were drawing near to the grey hill - country of the emyn muil [???] the
southern march of wilderland .
there were many birds about the cliffs and the rock - chimneys [???] and all
day high in the air flocks of birds had been circling [???] black against the
pale sky . as they lay in their camp that day [???] watched the flights
doubtfully [???] wondering if [???] had been doing some mischief and the news
of
their voyage was now moving in the wilderness . later as the sun was setting [???]
and the company was stirring and getting ready to start again [???] he descried a
dark spot against the fading light : a great bird high and far off [???] now
wheeling [???] now flying on slowly southwards .
' what is that [???] legolas ? ' he asked [???] pointing to the northern sky . ' is
it [???] as i think . an eagle ? '
' yes . ' said legolas . ` it is an eagle [???] a hunting eagle . i wonder what
that [???] . it is far from the mountains . '
` we will not start until it is fully dark [???] ' said [???] .
the eighth night of their journey came . it was silent and windless ; the
grey east wind had passed away . the thin [???] of the moon had fallen
early into the pale sunset [???] but the sky was clear above [???] and though far away
in the south there were great ranges of cloud that still shone faintly [???] in

the west stars glinted bright .
` come ! ' said [???] . ` we will venture one more journey by night . we
are coming to reaches of the river that i do not know well : for i have never
journeyed by water in these parts before [???] not between here and the rapids of
sarn [???] . but if i am right in my reckoning [???] those are still many miles
ahead . still there are dangerous places even before we come there : rocks and
stony eyots in the stream . we must keep a sharp watch and not try to paddle
swiftly . '
to sam in the leading boat was given the task of watchman . he lay
forward peering into the gloom . the night grew dark [???] but the stars above
were strangely bright [???] and there was a glimmer on the face of the river . it
was close on midnight [???] and they had been drifting for some while . hardly
using the [???] [???] when suddenly sam cried out . only a few yards ahead dark
shapes loomed up in the stream and he heard the [???] of racing water . there
was a swift current which swung left [???] towards the eastern shore where the
channel was clear . as they were swept aside the travellers could see [???] now
very close [???] the pale foam of the river [???] against sharp rocks that were
thrust out far into the stream like a ridge of teeth . the boats were all
[???] together .
` hoy there [???] [???] ! ' shouted [???] [???] as his boat [???] into the
leader . ` this is madness ! we cannot dare the rapids by night ! but no boat
can live in sarn [???] [???] be it night or day . '
` back [???] back ! ' cried [???] . ' turn ! turn if you can ! ' he drove his
paddle into the water [???] trying to hold the boat and bring it round .
' i am out of my reckoning [???] ' he said to [???] . ' i did not know that we
had come so far : [???] fl ows faster than i thought . sarn [???] must be
close at hand already . '
with great efforts they checked the boats and slowly brought them
about ; but at first they could make only small headway against the current [???]
and all the time they were carried nearer and nearer to the eastern bank .
now dark and [???] it loomed up in the night .
' all together [???] paddle ! ' shouted [???] . ' paddle ! or we shall be
driven on the shoals . ' even as he spoke [???] felt the keel beneath him
grate upon stone .
at that moment there was a twang of [???] : several arrows whistled
over them [???] and some fell among them . one smote [???] between the
shoulders

and he lurched forward with a cry [???] letting go his paddle : but the arrow fell
back . foiled by his hidden coat of mail . another passed through [???] ' s
hood ; and a third stood fast in the [???] of the second boat [???] close by
merry ' s hand . sam thought he could glimpse black figures running to and fro
upon the long [???] - banks that lay under the eastern shore . they seemed
very near .
` [???] ! ' said legolas [???] falling into his own tongue .
` [???] ! ' cried [???] .
` [???] ' s doing [???] i ' ll be bound . ' said sam to [???] . ` and a nice place
to choose [???] too . the river seems set on taking us right into their arms ! '
they all leaned forward straining at the [???] : even sam took a hand .
every moment they expected to feel the bite of black - feathered arrows . many
whined overhead or struck the water nearby ; but there were no more hits . it
was dark [???] but not too dark for the night - eyes of [???] [???] and in the
star - glimmer they must have offered their cunning foes some mark [???] unless it
was that the grey cloaks of [???] and the grey timber of the elf - wrought
boats defeated the malice of the archers of [???] .
stroke by stroke they laboured on . in the darkness it was hard to be
sure that they were indeed moving at all ; but slowly the [???] of the water
grew less [???] and the shadow of the eastern bank faded back into the night . at
last [???] as far as they could judge [???] they had reached the middle of the stream
again and had driven their boats back some distance above the [???] rocks .
then half turning they thrust them with all their strength towards the
western shore . under the shadow of bushes leaning out over the water they
halted and drew breath .
legolas laid down his paddle and took up the bow that he had brought
from [???] . then he sprang ashore and climbed a few paces up the bank .
stringing the bow and fitting an arrow he turned [???] peering back over the
river into the darkness . across the water there were shrill cries [???] but
nothing could be seen .
[???] looked up at the elf standing tall above him [???] as he gazed into
the night [???] seeking a mark to shoot at . his head was dark [???] crowned with sharp
white stars that glittered in the black [???] of the sky behind . but now
rising and sailing up from the south the great clouds advanced [???] sending out
dark [???] into the starry fields . a sudden dread fell on the company .
` [???] [???] ! ' sighed legolas as he looked up . even as he did
so [???] a dark shape [???] like a cloud and yet not a cloud [???] for it moved far more

swiftly [???] came out of the blackness in the south [???] and sped towards the
company [???] blotting out all light as it approached . soon it appeared as a
great winged creature [???] blacker than the pits in the night . fierce voices
rose up to greet it from across the water . [???] felt a sudden chill running
through him and clutching at his heart ; there was a deadly cold [???] like the
memory of an old wound [???] in his shoulder . he [???] down [???] as if to hide .
suddenly the great bow of [???] sang . shrill went the arrow from the
elven - string . [???] looked up . almost above him the winged shape [???] .
there was a harsh croaking scream [???] as it fell out of the air [???] vanishing down
into the gloom of the eastern shore . the sky was clean again . there was a
tumult of many voices far away [???] cursing and wailing in the darkness [???] and
then silence . neither shaft nor cry came again from the east that night .
after a while [???] led the boats back [???] . they felt their way
along the water ' s edge for some distance [???] until they found a small shallow
bay . a few low trees grew there close to the water [???] and behind them rose a
steep rocky bank . here the company decided to stay and [???] the dawn : it
was useless to attempt to move further by night . they made no camp and lit
no fire [???] but lay [???] in the boats [???] moored close together .
' praised be the bow of [???] [???] and the hand and eye of legolas ! '
said [???] [???] as he [???] a wafer of [???] . ' that was a mighty shot in the
dark [???] my friend ! '
' but who can say what it hit ? ' said legolas .
' i cannot [???] ' said [???] . ` but i am glad that the shadow came no nearer .
i liked it not at all . too much it reminded me of the shadow in moria - - the
shadow of the balrog [???] ' he ended in a whisper .
' it was not a balrog [???] ' said [???] [???] still shivering with the chill that
had come upon him . ' it was something colder . i think it was - - ' then he
paused and fell silent .
' what do you think ? ' asked [???] eagerly [???] leaning from his boat [???] as
if he was trying to catch a glimpse of [???] ' s face .
` i think - - no [???] i will not say [???] ' answered [???] . ` whatever it was [???] its
fall has dismayed our enemies . '
` so it seems [???] ' said [???] . ` yet where they are [???] and how many [???] and
what they will do next [???] we do not know . this night we must all be sleepless !
dark hides us now . bu t what the day will show who can tell ? have your
weapons close to hand ! '
sam sat tapping the hilt of his sword as if he were counting on his

fingers [???] and looking up at the sky . ` it ' s very strange [???] ' he murmured . ` the
moon ' s the same in the shire and in wilderland [???] or it ought to be . but
either it ' s out of its running [???] or i ' m all wrong in my reckoning . you ' ll
remember [???] mr . [???] [???] the moon was waning as we lay on the flet up in that
tree : a week from the full [???] i reckon . and we ' d been a week on the way last
night [???] when up pops a new moon as thin as a nail - paring [???] as if we had never
stayed no time in the elvish country .
` well [???] i can remember three nights there for certain [???] and i seem to
remember several more [???] but i would take my oath it was never a whole month .
anyone would think that time did not count in there ! '
` and perhaps that was the way of it [???] ' said [???] . ` in that land [???] maybe [???]
we were in a time that has elsewhere long gone by . it was not [???] i think [???]
until [???] bore us back to [???] that we returned to the time that
flows through mortal lands to the great sea . and i don ' t remember any moon [???]
either new or old [???] in caras [???] : only stars by night and sun by day . '
legolas stirred in his boa t . ` nay [???] time does not tarry ever [???] ' he said ;
` but change and growth is not in all things and places alike . for the elves
the world moves [???] and it moves both very swift and very slow . swift [???] because
they themselves change little [???] and all else fleets by : it is a grief to
them . slow [???] because they do not count the running years [???] not for themselves .
the passing seasons are but ripples ever repeated in the long long stream .
yet beneath the sun all things must wear to an end at last . '
` but the wearing is slow in [???] [???] ' said [???] . ` the power of the lady
is on it . rich are the hours [???] though short they seem [???] in caras [???] [???]
where [???] [???] the elven - ring . '
' that should not have been said outside [???] [???] not even to me [???] ' said
[???] . ` speak no more of it ! but so it is [???] sam : in that land you lost your
count . there time flowed swiftly by us [???] as for the elves . the old moon
passed [???] and a new moon waxed and waned in the world outside [???] while we
tarried there . and [???] a new moon came again . winter is nearly gone .
time flows on to a spring of little hope . '
the night passed silently . no voice or call was heard again across the
water . the travellers [???] in their boats felt the changing of the
weather . the air grew warm and very still under the great moist clouds that
had floated up from the south and the distant seas . the rushing of the river
over the rocks of the rapids seemed to grow louder and closer . the twigs of
the trees above them began to drip .

when the day came the mood of the world about them had become soft and
sad . slowly the dawn grew to a pale light [???] diffused and shadowless . there
was mist on the river [???] and white fog [???] the shore ; the far bank could
not be seen .
` i can ' t abide fog [???] ' said sam ; ` but this seems to be a lucky one . now
perhaps we can get away without those cursed [???] seeing us . '
` perhaps so [???] ' said [???] . ` but it will be hard to find the path
unless the fog lifts a little later on . and we must find the path [???] if we are
to pass sarn [???] and come to the emyn muil . '
' i do not see why we should pass the rapids or follow the river any
further [???] ' said [???] . ` if the emyn muil lie before us [???] then we can abandon
these cockle - boats [???] and strike westward and southward [???] until we come to the
[???] and cross into my own land . '
` we can [???] if we are making for minas [???] [???] ' said [???] [???] ` but that is
not yet agreed . and such a course may be more perilous than it sounds . the
vale of [???] is flat and [???] [???] and fog is a deadly peril there for those
on foot and laden . i would not abandon our boats until we must . the river is
at least a path that cannot be missed . '
` but the enemy holds the eastern bank [???] ' objected [???] . ` and even if
you pass the gates of [???] and come [???] to the [???] [???] what
will you do then ? leap down the falls and land in the marshes ? '
` no ! ' answered [???] . ` say rather that we will bear our boats by the
ancient way to [???] - foot [???] and there take to the water again . do you not
know [???] [???] [???] or do you choose to forget the north stair [???] and the high seat
upon amon hen [???] that were made in the days of the great kings ? i at least
have a mind to stand in that high place again [???] before i decide my further
course . there [???] maybe [???] we shall see some sign that will guide us . '
[???] held out long against this choice ; but when it became plain
that [???] would follow [???] [???] wherever he went [???] he gave in . ' it is not
the way of the men of minas [???] to desert their friends at need [???] ' he
said [???] ` and you will need my strength [???] if ever you are to reach the [???] .
to the tall isle i will go [???] but no further . there i shall turn to my home [???]
alone if my help has not earned the reward of any companionship . '
the day was now growing [???] and the fog had lifted a little . it was
decided that [???] and legolas should at once go forward along the shore [???]
while the others remained by the boats . [???] hoped to find some way by
which they could carry both their boats and their [???] to the smoother

water beyond the rapids .
` boats of the elves would not sink [???] maybe [???] ' he said [???] ` but that does not
say that we should come through sarn [???] alive . none have ever done so
yet . no road was made by the men of [???] in this region [???] for even in their
great days their realm did not reach up [???] beyond the emyn muil ; but
there is a portage - way somewhere on the western shore [???] if i can find it . it
cannot yet have perished ; for light boats used to journey out of wilderland
down to [???] [???] and still did so until a few years ago [???] when the [???] of
[???] began to [???] . '
' seldom in my life has any boat come out of the north [???] and the [???]
[???] on the east - shore [???] ' said [???] . ` if you go forward [???] peril will grow
with every mile [???] even if you find a path . '
` peril lies ahead on every southward road [???] ' answered [???] . ` wait for
us one day . if we do not return in that time [???] you will know that evil has
indeed befa llen us . then you must take a new leader and follow him as best
you can . '
it was with a heavy heart that [???] saw [???] and legolas climb the
steep bank and vanish into the mists ; but his fears proved groundless . only
two or three hours had passed [???] and it was barely mid - day [???] when the shadowy
shapes of the [???] appeared again .
` all is well [???] ' said [???] [???] as he [???] down the bank . ' there is a
track [???] and it leads to a good landing that is still serviceable . the
distance is not great : the head of the rapids is but half a mile below us [???]
and they are little more than a mile long . not far beyond them the stream
becomes clear and smooth again [???] though it runs swiftly . our hardest task
will be to get our boats and [???] to the old portage - way . we have found
it [???] but it lies well back from the water - side here [???] and runs under the lee
of a rock - wall [???] a furlong or more from the shore . we did not find where the
northward landing lies . if it still remains [???] we must have passed it
yesterday night . we might labour far [???] and yet miss it in the fog . i
fear we must leave the river now [???] and make for the portage - way as best we
can from here . '
` that would not be easy [???] even if we were all men [???] ' said [???] .
` yet such as we are we will try it [???] ' said [???] .
' aye [???] we will [???] ' said [???] . ` the legs of men will lag on a rough road [???]
while a dwarf goes on [???] be the burden twice his own weight [???] master [???] ! '
the task proved hard indeed [???] yet in the end it was done . the goods were

taken out of the boats and brought to the top of the bank [???] where there was a
level space . then the boats were drawn out of the water and carried up . they
were far less heavy than any had expected . of what tree growing in the
elvish country they were made not even legolas knew ; but the wood was
tough
and yet strangely light . merry and [???] alone could carry their boat with
ease along the flat . nonetheless it needed the strength of the two men to
lift and haul them over the ground that the company now had to cross . it
[???] up away from the river [???] a tumbled waste of grey limestone - [???] [???]
with many hidden holes shrouded with weeds and bushes ; there were thickets
of [???] [???] and sheer dells ; and here and there [???] [???] fed by waters
trickling from the terraces further inland .
one by one [???] and [???] carried the boats [???] while the others
toiled and [???] after them with the [???] . at last all was removed
and laid on the portage - way . then with little further hindrance [???] save from
[???] briars and many fallen stones [???] they moved forward all together .
fog still hung in veils upon the crumbling rock - wall [???] and to their left mist
shrouded the river : they could hear it rushing and foaming over the sharp
shelves and stony teeth of sarn [???] [???] but they could not see it . twice they
made the journey [???] before all was brought safe to the southern landing .
there the portage - way [???] turning back to the water - side [???] ran gently down
to the shallow edge of a little pool . it seemed to have been [???] in the
river - side [???] not by hand [???] but by the water [???] down from sarn [???]
against a low pier of rock that [???] out some way into the stream . beyond
it the shore rose sheer into a grey cliff [???] and there was no further passage
for those on foot .
already the short afternoon was past [???] and a dim cloudy [???] was closing
in . they sat beside the water listening to the confused rush and roar of the
rapids hidden in the mist ; they wer e tired and sleepy [???] and their hearts were
as gloomy as the dying day .
' well [???] here we are [???] and here we must pass another night [???] ' said [???] .
` we need sleep [???] and even if [???] had a mind to pass the gates of [???]
by night [???] we are all too tired - except [???] no doubt [???] our [???] dwarf . '
[???] made no reply : he was nodding as he sat .
` let us rest as much as we can now [???] ' said [???] . ` tomorrow we must
journey by day again . unless the weather changes once more and cheats us [???] we
shall have a good chance of slipping through [???] unseen by any eyes on the

eastern shore . but tonight two must watch together in turns : three hours off
and one on guard . '
nothing happened that night worse than a brief [???] of rain an hour
before dawn . as soon as it was fully light they started . already the fog was
thinning . they kept as close as they could to the western side [???] and they
could see the dim shapes of the low cliffs rising ever higher [???] shadowy walls
with their feet in the hurrying river . in the mid - morning the clouds drew
down lower [???] and it began to rain heavily . they drew the skin - covers over
their boats to prevent them from being flooded [???] and drifted on : little could
be seen before them or about them through the grey falling curtains .
the rain [???] however [???] did not last long . slowly the sky above grew
lighter [???] and then suddenly the clouds broke [???] and their [???] [???]
trailed away northward up the river . the fogs and mists were gone . before
the travellers lay a wide ravine [???] with great rocky sides to which clung [???]
upon shelves and in narrow [???] [???] a few thrawn trees . the channel grew
narrower and the river swifter . now they were speeding along with little
hope of stopping or turning [???] whatever they might meet ahead . over them was a
lane of pale - blue sky [???] around them the dark [???] river [???] and before
them black [???] shutting out the sun [???] the hills of emyn muil [???] in which no
opening could be seen .
[???] peering forward saw in the distance two great rocks approaching :
like great [???] or pillars of stone they seemed . tall and sheer and
[???] they stood upon either side of the stream . a narrow gap appeared
between them [???] and the river swept the boats towards it .
` behold the [???] [???] the pillars of the kings ! ' cried [???] . ` we
shall pass them soon . keep the boats in line [???] and as far apart as you can !
hold the middle of the stream ! '
as [???] was borne towards them the great pillars rose like towers to
meet him . giants they seemed to him [???] vast grey figures silent but
threatening . then he saw that they were indeed shaped and fashioned : the
craft and power of old had wrought upon them [???] and still they preserved
through the suns and rains of forgotten years the mighty likenesses in which
they had been hewn . upon great [???] founded in the deep waters stood
two great kings of stone : still with [???] eyes and [???] brows they
frowned upon the north . the left hand of each was raised palm outwards in
gesture of warning ; in each right hand there was an axe ; upon each head
there was a crumbling helm and crown . great power and majesty they still

wore [???] the silent wardens of a long - vanished kingdom . awe and fear fell upon
[???] [???] and he cowered down [???] shutting his eyes and not daring to look up as
the boat drew near . even [???] bowed his head as the boats whirled by .
frail and fleeting as little leaves [???] under the enduring shadow of the
[???] of n [???] menor . so they passed into the dark chasm of the gates .
sheer rose the dreadful cliffs to [???] heights on either side . far
off was the dim sky . the black waters roared and echoed [???] and a wind screamed
over them . [???] [???] over his knees heard sam in front muttering and
groaning : ` what a place ! what a horrible place ! just let me get out of this
boat [???] and i ' ll never wet my toes in a puddle again [???] let alone a river ! '
` fear not ! ' said a strange voice behind him . [???] turned and saw
strider [???] and yet not strider ; for the [???] ranger was no longer
there . in the stern sat [???] son of [???] [???] proud and erect [???] guiding
the boat with skilful strokes ; his hood was cast back [???] and his dark hair was
blowing in the wind [???] a light was in his eyes : a king returning from exile to
his own land .
' fear not ! ' he said . ` long have i desired to look upon the likenesses
of [???] and [???] [???] my sires of old . under their shadow [???] [???] the
[???] son of [???] of the house of [???] [???] ' s son heir of
[???] [???] has nought to dread ! '
then the light of his eyes faded [???] and he spoke to himself : ` would that
[???] were here ! how my heart yearns for minas anor and the walls of my
own city ! but whither now shall i go ? '
the chasm was long and dark [???] and filled with the noise of wind and
rushing water and echoing stone . it bent somewhat towards the west so that
at first all was dark ahead ; but soon [???] saw a tall gap of light before
him [???] ever growing . swiftly it drew near [???] and suddenly the boats shot
through [???] out into a wide clear light .
the sun [???] already long fallen from the noon [???] was shining in a windy sky .
the pent waters spread out into a long oval lake [???] pale nen [???] [???] fenced
by steep grey hills whose sides were clad with trees [???] but their heads were
bare [???] cold - gleaming in the sunlight . at the far southern end rose three
peaks . the midmost stood somewhat forward from the others and sundered
from
them [???] an island in the waters [???] about which the flowing river flung pale
[???] arms . distant but deep there came up on the wind a roaring sound
like the roll of thunder heard far away .

` behold tol brandir ! ' said [???] [???] pointing south to the tall peak .
' upon the left stands amon [???] [???] and upon the right is amon hen the hills of
hearing and of sight . in the days of the great kings there were high seats
upon them [???] and watch was kept there . but it is said that no foot of man or
beast has ever been set upon tol brandir . ere the shade of night falls we
shall come to them . i hear the endless voice of [???] calling . '
the company rested now for a while [???] drifting south on the current that
flowed through the middle of the lake . they ate some food [???] and then they
took to their [???] and hastened on their way . the sides of the westward
hills fell into shadow [???] and the sun grew round and red . here and there a
misty star peered out . the three peaks loomed before them [???] darkling in the
[???] . [???] was roaring with a grea t voice . already night was laid on
the flowing waters when the travellers came at last under the shadow of the
hills .
the tenth day of their journey was over . wilderland was behind them .
they could go no further without choice between the east - way and the west .
the last stage of the quest was before them .




chapter 10 . the breaking of the fellowship



[???] led them to the right arm of the river . here upon its western
side under the shadow of tol brandir a green lawn ran down to the water from
the feet of amon hen . behind it rose the first gentle [???] of the hill
clad with trees [???] and trees marched away westward along the curving shores of
the lake . a little spring fell tumbling down and fed the grass .
' here we will rest tonight [???] ' said [???] . ` this is the lawn of parth
[???] : a fair place in the summer days of old . let us hope that no evil has
yet come here . '
they drew up their boats on the green banks [???] and beside them they made
their camp . they set a watch [???] but had no sight nor sound of their enemies .
if [???] had contrived to follow them [???] he remained unseen and unheard .
nonetheless as the night wore on [???] grew uneasy [???] tossing often in his
sleep and waking . in the small hours he got up and came to [???] [???] whose turn
it was to watch .
` why are you waking ? ' asked [???] . ` it is not your watch . '
` i do not know [???] ' answered [???] ; ` but a shadow and a threat has been
growing in my sleep . it would be well to draw your sword . '
` why ? ' said [???] . ` are enemies at hand ? '
` let us see what sting may show [???] ' answered [???] .
[???] then drew the elf - blade from its sheath . to his dismay the edges
gleamed dimly in the night . ` [???] ! ' he said . ` not very near [???] and yet too
near [???] it seems . '
` i feared as much [???] ' said [???] . ` but maybe they are not on this side
of the river . the light of sting is faint [???] and it may point to no more than
spies of [???] roaming on the [???] of amon [???] . i have never heard
before of [???] upon amon hen . yet who knows what may happen in these
evil
days [???] now that minas [???] no longer holds secure the passages of [???] .
we must go warily tomorrow . '
the day came like fire and smoke . low in the east there were black bars
of cloud like the fumes of a great burning . the rising sun lit them from
beneath with flames of murky red ; but soon it climbed above them into a
clear sky . the summit of tol brandir was tipped with gold . [???] looked out

eastward and gazed at the tall island . its si des sprang sheer out of the
running water . high up above the tall cliffs were steep [???] upon which
trees climbed [???] mounting one head above another ; and above them again were
grey faces of [???] rock [???] crowned by a great spire of stone . many
birds were circling about it [???] but no sign of other living things could be
seen .
when they had eaten [???] [???] called the company together . ` the day has
come at last [???] ' he said : ' the day of choice which we have long delayed . what
shall now become of our company that has travelled so far in fellowship ?
shall we turn west with [???] and go to the wars of [???] ; or turn east
to the fear and shadow ; or shall we break our fellowship and go this way and
that as each may choose ? whatever we do must be done soon . we cannot
long
halt here . the enemy is on the eastern shore [???] we know ; but i fear that the
[???] may already be on this side of the water . '
there was a long silence in which no one spoke or moved .
' well [???] [???] [???] ' said [???] at last . ` i fear that the burden is laid
upon you . you are the bearer appointed by the council . your own way you
alone can choose . in this matter i cannot advise you . i am not [???] [???] and
though i have tried to bear his part [???] i do not know what design or hope he
had for this hour [???] if indeed he had any . most likely it seems that if he
were here now the choice would still wait on you . such is your fate . '
[???] did not answer at once . then he spoke slowly . ` i know that haste
is needed [???] yet i cannot choose . the burden is heavy . give me an hour longer [???]
and i will speak . let me be alone ! '
[???] looked at him with kindly pity . ` very well [???] [???] son of
drogo [???] ' he said . ` you shall have an hour [???] and you shall be alone . we will
stay here for a while . but do not stray far or out of call . '
[???] sat for a moment with his head bowed . sam [???] who had been watching
his master with great concern [???] shook his head and muttered : ' plain as a
[???] it is [???] but it ' s no good sam [???] putting in his spoke just now . '
[???]
presently [???] got up and walked away ; and sam saw that while the
others restrained themselves and did not stare at him [???] the eyes of [???]
followed [???] intently [???] until he passed out of sight in the trees at the
foot of amon hen .
wandering [???] at first in the wood [???] [???] found that his feet

were leading him up towards the [???] of the hill . he came to a path [???] the
[???] ruins of a road of long ago . in steep places stairs of stone had
been hewn [???] but now they were cracked and worn [???] and split by the roots of
trees . for some while he climbed [???] not caring which way he went [???] until he
came to a grassy place . rowan - trees grew about it [???] and in the midst was a
wide flat stone . the little upland lawn was open upon the east and was
filled now with the early sunlight . [???] halted and looked out over the
river [???] far below him [???] to tol brandir and the birds wheeling in the great
gulf of air between him and the [???] isle . the voice of [???] was a
mighty roaring mingled with a deep [???] boom .
he sat down upon the stone and cupped his chin in his hands [???] staring
eastwards but seeing little with his eyes . all that had happened since [???]
left the shire was passing through his mind [???] and he recalled and pondered
everything that he could remember of [???] ' s words . time went on [???] and
still he was no nearer to a choice .
suddenly he awoke from his thoughts : a strange feeling came to him that
something was behind him [???] that [???] eyes were upon him . he sprang up
and turned ; but all that he saw to his surprise was [???] [???] and his face
was smiling and kind .
` i was afraid for you [???] [???] [???] ' he said [???] coming forward . ` if [???] is
right and [???] are near [???] then none of us should wander alone [???] and you least
of all : so much depends on you . and my heart too is heavy . may i stay now
and talk for a while [???] since i have found you ? it would comfort me . where
there are so many [???] all speech becomes a debate without end . but two together
may perhaps find wisdom . '
` you are kind [???] ' answered [???] . ' but i do not think that any speech
will help me . for i know what i should do [???] but i am afraid of doing it [???]
[???] : afraid . '
[???] stood silent . [???] roared endlessly on . the wind murmured in
the branches of the trees . [???] shivered .
suddenly [???] came and sat beside him . ` are you sure that you do not
suffer needlessly ? ' he said . ` i wish to help you . you need counsel in your
hard choice . will you not take mine ? '
' i think i know already what counsel you would give [???] [???] [???] ' said
[???] . ' and it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart . '
` warning ? warning against what ? ' said [???] sharply .
' against delay . against the way that seems easier . against refusal of

the burden that is laid on me . against - well [???] if it must be said [???] against
trust in the strength and truth of men . '
` yet that strength has long protected you far away in your little
country [???] though you knew it not . '
' i do not doubt the valour of your people . but the world is changing .
the walls of minas [???] may be strong [???] but they are not strong enough . if
they fail [???] what then ? '
' we shall fall in battle valiantly . yet there is still hope that they
will not fail . '
' no hope while the ring lasts [???] ' said [???] .
' ah ! the ring ! ' said [???] [???] his eyes lighting . ' the ring ! is it not
a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small a
thing ? so small a thing ! and i have seen it only for an instant in the house
of [???] . could i not have a sight of it again ? '
[???] looked up . his heart went suddenly cold . he caught the strange
gleam in [???] ' s eyes [???] yet his face was still kind and friendly . ' it is
best that it should lie hidden [???] ' he answered .
' as you wish . i care not [???] ' said [???] . ' yet may i not even speak of
it ? for you seem ever to think only of its power in the hands of the enemy :
of its evil uses not of its good . the world is changing [???] you say . minas
[???] will fall [???] if the ring lasts . but why ? certainly [???] if the ring were
with the enemy . but why [???] if it were with us ? '
' were you not at the council ? ' answered [???] . ` because we cannot use
it [???] and what is done with it turns to evil . '
[???] got up and walked about impatiently . ' so you go on [???] ' he cried .
' [???] [???] [???] - - all these folk have taught you to say so . for themselves
they may be right . these elves and half - elves and [???] [???] they would come
to grief perhaps . yet often i doubt if they are wise and not merely timid .
but each to his own kind . true - hearted men [???] they will not be corrupted . we
of minas [???] have been [???] through long years of trial . we do not
desire the power of [???] - lords [???] only strength to defend ourselves [???]
strength in a just cause . and behold ! in our need chance brings to light the
- ring of power . it is a gift [???] i say ; a gift to the foes of [???] . it is mad
not to use it [???] to use the power of the enemy against him . the fearless [???] the
ruthless [???] these alone will achieve victory . what could not a warrior do in
this hour [???] a great leader ? what could not [???] do ? or if he refuses [???] why

not [???] ? the ring would give me power of command . how i would
drive the
hosts of [???] [???] and all men would flock to my banner ! '
[???] strode up and down [???] speaking ever more loudly : almost he seemed
to have forgotten [???] [???] while his talk dwelt on walls and weapons [???] and the
mustering of men ; and he drew plans for great alliances and glorious
victories to be ; and he cast down [???] [???] and became himself a mighty king [???]
[???] and wise . suddenly he stopped and waved his arms .
' and they tell us to throw it away ! ' he cried . ` i do not sa y destroy
it . that might be well [???] if reason could show any hope of doing so . it does
not . the only plan that is proposed to us is that a halfling should walk
blindly into [???] and offer the enemy every chance of [???] it for
himself . folly !
' surely you see it [???] my friend ? ' he said [???] turning now suddenly to [???]
again . ` you say that you are afraid . if it is so [???] the boldest should pardon
you . but is it not really your good sense that revolts ? '
' no [???] i am afraid [???] ' said [???] . ' simply afraid . but i am glad to have
heard you speak so fully . my mind is clearer now . '
` then you will come to minas [???] ? ' cried [???] . his eyes were
shining and his face eager .
` you [???] me [???] ' said [???] .
' but you will come [???] at least for a while ? ' [???] persisted . ' my city
is not far now ; and it is little further from there to [???] than from
here . we have been long in the wilderness [???] and you need news of what the
enemy is doing before you make a move . come with me [???] [???] [???] ' he said .
` you
need rest before your venture . if go you must . ' he laid his hand on the
hobbit ' s shoulder in friendly fashion ; but [???] felt the hand trembling
with suppressed [???] . he stepped quickly away [???] and eyed with alarm the
tall man [???] nearly twice his height and many times his match in strength .
` why are you so [???] ? ' said [???] . ` i am a true man [???] neither
thief nor tracker . i need your ring : that you know now ; but i give you my
word that i do not desire to keep it . will you not at least let me make
trial of my plan ? lend me the ring ! '
` no ! no ! ' cried [???] . ' the council laid it upon me to bear it . '
` it is by our own folly that the enemy will defeat us [???] ' cried [???] .
` how it angers me ! fool ! obstinate fool ! running wilfully to death and

ruining our cause . if any mortals have claim to the ring [???] it is the men of
n [???] menor [???] and not halflings . it is not yours save by unhappy chance . it might
have been mine . it should be mine . give it to me ! '
[???] did not answer [???] but moved away till the great flat stone stood
between them . ` come [???] come [???] my friend ! ' said [???] in a softer voice . ' why
not get rid of it ? why not be free of your doubt and fear ? you can lay the
blame on me [???] if you will . you can say that i was too strong and took it by
force . for i am too strong for you [???] halfling [???] ' he cried ; and suddenly he
sprang over the stone and leaped at [???] . his fair and pleasant face was
hideously changed ; a raging fire was in his eyes .
[???] [???] aside and again put the stone between them . there was only
one thing he could do : trembling he pulled out the ring upon its chain and
quickly slipped it on his finger [???] even as [???] sprang at him again . the
man gasped [???] stared for a moment amazed [???] and then ran wildly about [???] seeking
here and there among the rocks and trees .
' miserable trickster ! ' he shouted . ` let me get my hands on you ! now i
see your mind . you will take the ring to [???] and sell us all . you have
only waited your chance to leave us in the lurch . curse you and all
halflings to death and darkness ! ' then [???] catching his foot on a stone [???] he
fell [???] and lay upon his face . for a while he was as still as if his
own curse had struck him down ; then suddenly he wept .
he rose and passed his hand over his eyes [???] dashing away the tears .
' what have i said ? ' he cried . ` what have i done ? [???] [???] [???] ! ' he called .
' come back ! a madness took me [???] but it has passed . come back ! '
there was no answer . [???] did not even hear his cries . he was already
far away [???] leaping blindly up the path to the hill - top . terror and grief
shook him [???] seeing in his thought the mad fierce face of [???] [???] and his
burning eyes .
soon he came out alone on the summit of amon hen [???] and halted [???] gasping
for breath . he saw as through a mist a wide flat circle [???] paved with mighty
flags [???] and surrounded with a crumbling battlement ; and in the middle [???] set
upon four carven pillars [???] was a high seat [???] reached by a stair of many steps .
up he went and sat upon the ancient chair [???] feeling like a lost child that
had [???] upon the throne of mountain - kings .
at first he could see little . he seemed to be in a world of mist in
which there were only shadows : the ring was upon him . then here and there
the mist gave way and he saw many visions : small and clear as if they were

under his eyes upon a table [???] and yet remote . there was no sound [???] only bright
living images . the world seemed to have shrunk and fallen silent . he was
sitting upon the seat of seeing [???] on amon hen [???] the hill of the eye of the men
of n [???] menor . eastward he looked into wide [???] lands [???] nameless plains [???]
and forests [???] . northward he looked [???] and the great river lay like a
ribbon beneath him [???] and the misty mountains stood small and hard as broken
teeth . westward he looked and saw the broad pastures of [???] ; and orthanc [???]
the [???] of [???] [???] like a black spike . southward he looked [???] and below
his very feet the great river curled like a [???] wave and [???] over
the falls of [???] into a foaming pit ; a [???] [???] played upon the
fume . and [???] [???] he saw [???] the mighty delta of the river [???] and [???] of
sea - birds whirling like a white dust in the sun [???] and beneath them a green
and silver sea [???] [???] in endless lines .
but everywhere he looked he saw the signs of war . the misty mountains
were [???] like [???] : [???] were issuing out of a thousand holes .
under the boughs of [???] there was deadly strife of elves and men and
fell beasts . the land of the [???] was [???] ; a cloud was over moria ;
smoke rose on the borders of [???] .
horsemen were [???] on the grass of [???] ; wolves poured from
[???] . from the havens of harad ships of war put out to sea ; and out of
the east men were moving endlessly : swordsmen [???] spearmen [???] bowmen upon
horses [???]
[???] of [???] and laden wains . all the power of the dark lord was
in motion . then turning south again he beheld minas [???] . far away it
seemed . and beautiful : white - walled [???] many - towered [???] proud and fair upon its
mountain - seat ; its battlements glittered with steel [???] and its [???] were
bright with many banners . hope leaped in his heart . but against minas [???]
was set another fortress [???] greater and more strong . thither [???] eastward [???]
unwilling his eye was drawn . it passed the ruined bridges of [???] [???] the
grinning gates of minas [???] . and the haunted mountains [???] and it looked
upon [???] [???] the valley of terror in the land of [???] . darkness lay
there under the sun . fire glowed amid the smoke . mount doom was burning [???]
and
a great reek rising . then at last his gaze was held : wall upon wall [???]
battlement upon battlement [???] black [???] [???] strong [???] mountain of iron [???]
gate of steel [???] tower of adamant [???] he saw it : barad - dyr [???] fortress of [???] .
all hope left him .

and suddenly he felt the eye . there was an eye in the dark tower that
did not sleep . he knew that it had become aware of his gaze . a fierce eager
will was there . it leaped towards him ; almost like a finger he felt it [???]
searching for him . very soon it would nail him down [???] know just exactly where
he was . amon [???] it touched . it glanced upon tol brandir he threw himself
from the seat [???] [???] [???] covering his head with his grey hood .
he heard himself crying out : never [???] never ! or was it : verily i come [???] i
come to you ? he could not tell . then as a flash from some other point of
power there came to his mind another thought : take it off ! take it off !
fool [???] take it off ! take off the ring !
the two powers strove in him . for a moment [???] perfectly balanced between
their piercing points [???] he [???] [???] tormented . suddenly he was aware of
himself again . [???] [???] neither the voice nor the eye : free to choose [???] and
with one remaining instant in which to do so . he took the ring off his
finger . he was kneeling in clear sunlight before the high seat . a black
shadow seemed to pass like an arm above him ; it missed amon hen and
groped
out west [???] and faded . then all the sky was clean and blue and birds sang in
every tree .
[???] rose to his feet . a great weariness was on him [???] but his will was
firm and his heart lighter . he spoke aloud to himself . ` i will do now what i
must [???] ' he said . ' this at least is plain : the evil of the ring is already at
work even in the company [???] and the ring must leave them before it does more
harm . i will go alone . some i cannot trust [???] and those i can trust are too
dear to me : poor old sam [???] and merry and [???] . strider [???] too : his heart
yearns for minas [???] [???] and he will be needed there [???] now [???] has fallen
into evil . i will go alone . at once . '
he went quickly down the path and came back to the lawn where [???]
had found him . then he halted [???] listening . he thought he could hear cries and
calls from the woods near the shore below .
' they ' ll be hunting for me [???] ' he said . ` i wonder how long i have been
away . hours [???] i should think . ' he [???] . ' what can i do ? ' he muttered .
' i must go now or i shall never go . i shan ' t get a chance again . i hate
leaving them [???] and like this without any explanation . but surely they will
understand . sam will . and what else can i do ? '
slowly he drew out the ring and put it on once more . he vanished and
passed down the hill [???] less than a rustle of the wind .

the others remained long by the river - side . for some time they had been
silent [???] moving restlessly about ; but now they were sitting in a circle [???] and
they were talking . every now and again they made efforts to speak of other
things [???] of their long road and many adventures ; they questioned [???]
concerning the realm of [???] and its ancient history [???] and the [???] of
its great works that could still be seen in this strange border - land of the
emyn muil : the stone kings and the seats of [???] and hen [???] and the great
stair beside the falls of [???] . but always their thoughts and words
strayed back to [???] and the ring . what would [???] choose to do ? why
was
he [???] ?
` he is debating which course is the most desperate [???] i think [???] ' said
[???] . ' and well he may . it is now more hopeless than ever for the company
to go east [???] since we have been tracked by [???] [???] and must fear that the
secret of our journey is already betrayed . but minas [???] is no nearer to
the fire and the destruction of the burden .
` we may remain there for a while and make a brave stand ; but the lord
[???] and all his men cannot hope to do what even [???] said was beyond
his power : either to keep the burden secret . or to hold off the full might
of the enemy when he comes to take it . which way would any of us choose in
[???] ' s place ? i do not know . now indeed we miss [???] most . '
' grievous is our loss [???] ' said legolas . ' yet we must needs make up our
minds without his aid . why cannot we decide [???] and so help [???] ? let us call
him back and then vote ! i should vote for minas [???] . '
` and so should i [???] ' said [???] . ' we [???] of course [???] were only sent to help
the bearer along the road [???] to go no further than we wished ; and none of us
is under any oath or command to seek mount doom . hard was my parting
from
[???] . yet i have come so far [???] and i say this : now we have reached the
last choice [???] it is clear to me that i cannot leave [???] . i would choose
minas [???] [???] but if he does not [???] then i follow him . '
` and i too will go with him [???] ' said legolas . ` it would be faithless now
to say farewell . '
' it would indeed be a betrayal [???] if we all left him [???] ' said [???] . ' but
if he goes east [???] then all need not go with him ; nor do i think that all
should . that venture is desperate : as much so for eight as for three or two [???]
or one alone . if you would let me choose [???] then i should appoint three

companions : sam [???] who could not bear it otherwise ; and [???] ; and myself .
[???] will return to his own city [???] where his father and his people need
him ; and with him the others should go [???] or at least [???] and [???] [???]
if legolas is not willing to leave us . '
` that won ' t do at all ! ' cried merry . ' we can ' t leave [???] ! [???] and
i always intended to go wherever he went [???] and we still do . but we did not
realize what that would mean . it seemed different so far away [???] in the shire
or in [???] . it would be mad and cruel to let [???] go to [???] . why
can ' t we stop him ? '
' we must stop him [???] ' said [???] . ` and that is what he is [???]
about [???] i am sure . he knows we shan ' t agree to his going east . and he doesn ' t
like to ask anyone to go with him [???] poor old fellow . imagine it : going off to
[???] alone ! ' [???] [???] . ' but the dear silly old hobbit [???] he ought
to know that he hasn ' t got to ask . he ought to know that if we can ' t stop
him [???] we shan ' t leave him . '
' begging your pardon [???] ' said sam . ' i don ' t think you understand my
master at all . he isn ' t [???] about which way to go . of course not !
what ' s the good of minas [???] anyway ? to him [???] i mean [???] begging your
pardon [???]
master [???] [???] ' he added [???] and turned . it was then that they discovered that
[???] [???] who at first had been sitting silent on the outside of the circle [???]
was no longer there .
` now where ' s he got to ? ' cried sam [???] looking worried . ' he ' s been a bit
queer lately [???] to my mind . but anyway he ' s not in this business . he ' s off to
his home [???] as he always said ; and no blame to him . but mr . [???] [???] he knows
he ' s got to find the cracks of doom [???] if he can . but he ' s afraid . now it ' s
come to the point [???] he ' s just plain terrified . that ' s what his trouble is . of
course he ' s had a bit of schooling [???] so to speak - we all have - since we left
home [???] or he ' d be so terrified he ' d just fling the ring in the river and
bolt . but he ' s still too frightened to start . and he isn ' t [???] about us
either : whether we ' ll go along with him or no . he knows we mean to . that ' s
another thing that ' s bothering him . if he screws himself up to go [???] he ' ll
want to go alone . mark my words ! we ' re going to have trouble when he
comes
back . for he ' ll screw himself up all right [???] as sure as his name ' s [???] . '
' i believe you speak more wisely than any of us [???] sam [???] ' said [???] .
` and what shall we do [???] if you prove right ? '

' stop him ! don ' t let him go ! ' cried [???] .
' i wonder ? ' said [???] . ` he is the bearer [???] and the fate of the
burden is on him . i do not think that it is our part to drive him one way or
the other . nor do i think that we should succeed [???] if we tried . there are
other powers at work far stronger . '
` well [???] i wish [???] would [???] screw himself up [???] and come back . and let us
get it over [???] ' said [???] . ` this waiting is horrible ! surely the time is up ?
'
` yes [???] ' said [???] . ' the hour is long passed . the morning is wearing
away . we must call for him . '
at that moment [???] reappeared . he came out from the trees and
walked towards them without speaking . his face looked grim and sad . he
paused as if counting those that were present [???] and then sat down aloof [???] with
his eyes on the ground .
` where have you been [???] [???] ? ' asked [???] . ` have you seen [???] ? '
[???] [???] for a second . ` yes [???] and no [???] ' he answered slowly .
` yes : i found him some way up the hill [???] and i spoke to him . i urged him to
come to minas [???] and not to go east . i grew angry and he left me . he
vanished . i have never seen such a thing happen before . though i have heard
of it in tales . he must have put the ring on . i could not find him again . i
thought he would return to you . '
' is that all that you have to say ? ' said [???] [???] looking hard and not
too kindly at [???] .
` yes [???] ' he answered . ` i will say no more yet . '
` this is bad ! ' cried sam [???] jumping up . ` i don ' t know what this man has
been up to . why should mr . [???] put the thing on ? he didn ' t ought to have ;
and if he has [???] goodness knows what may have happened ! '
' but he wouldn ' t keep it on ` ' said merry . ` not when he had escaped the
[???] visitor [???] like [???] used to . '
` but where did he go ? where is he ? ' cried [???] . ' he ' s been away ages
now . '
` how long is it since you saw [???] last [???] [???] ? ' asked [???] .
` half an hour [???] maybe [???] ' he answered . ` or it might be an hour . i have
wandered for some time since . i do not know ! i do not know ! ' he put his
head in his hands [???] and sat as if bowed with grief .
` an hour since he vanished ! ' shouted sam . ` we must try and find him at
once . come on ! '

` wait a moment ! ' cried [???] . ` we must divide up into pairs [???] and
arrange - here [???] hold on ! wait ! '
it was no good . they took no notice of him . sam had dashed off first .
merry and [???] had followed [???] and were already disappearing westward into
the trees by the shore [???] shouting : [???] ! [???] ! in their clear [???] high
hobbit - voices . legolas and [???] were running . a sudden panic or madness
seemed to have fallen on the company .
` we shall all be scattered and lost [???] ' groaned [???] . ` [???] ! i do
not know what part you have played in this mischief [???] but help now ! go after
those two young [???] [???] and guard them at the least [???] even if you cannot
find [???] . come back to this spot [???] if you find him [???] or any traces of him . i
shall return soon . '
[???] sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of sam . just as he
reached the little lawn among the rowans he overtook him [???] toiling [???] [???]
panting and calling [???] [???] !
` come with me [???] sam ! ' he said . ` none of us should be alone . there is
mischief about . i feel it . i am going to the top [???] to the seat of amon hen [???]
to see what may be seen . and look ! it is as my heart guessed [???] [???] went
this way . follow me [???] and keep your eyes open ! ' he sped up the path .
sam did his best [???] but he could not keep up with strider the ranger [???] and
soon fell behind . he had not gone far before [???] was out of sight ahead .
sam stopped and puffed . suddenly he clapped his hand to his head .
` whoa [???] sam [???] ! ' he said aloud . ` your legs are too short [???] so use
your head ! let me see now ! [???] isn ' t lying [???] that ' s not his way ; but he
hasn ' t told us everything . something scared mr . [???] badly . he screwed
himself up to the point [???] sudden . he made up his mind at last to go . where
to ? off east . not without sam ? yes [???] without even his sam . that ' s hard [???] cruel
hard . '
sam passed his hand over his eyes [???] brushing away the tears . ' steady [???]
[???] ! ' he said . ` think [???] if you can ! he can ' t fly across rivers [???] and he
can ' t jump [???] . he ' s got no gear . so he ' s got to get back to the
boats . back to the boats ! back to the boats [???] sam [???] like lightning ! '
sam turned and bolted back down the path . he fell and cut his knees . up
he got and ran on . he came to the edge of the lawn of parth [???] by the
shore [???] where the boats were drawn up out of the water . no one was there .
there seemed to be cries in the woods behind [???] but he did not heed them . he
stood gazing for a moment . stock - still [???] gaping . a boat was sliding down the

bank all by itself . with a shout sam raced across the grass . the boat
slipped into the wat

[???]

er .
` coming [???] mr . [???] ! coming ! ' called sam [???] and flung himself from the
bank [???] clutching at the departing boat . he missed it by a yard . with a cry
and a splash he fell face downward into deep swift water . [???] he went
under [???] and the river closed over his curly head .
an exclamation of dismay came from the empty boat . a paddle [???] and
the boat put about . [???] was just in time to grasp sam by the hair as he
came up [???] [???] and struggling . fear was staring in his round brown eyes .
` up you come [???] sam my lad ! ' said [???] . ` now take my hand ! '
` save me [???] mr . [???] ! ' gasped sam . ` i ' m drownded . i can ' t see your
hand . '
` here it is . don ' t pinch [???] lad ! i won ' t let you go . tread water and
don ' t flounder [???] or you ' ll upset the boat . there now [???] get hold of the side [???]
and let me use the paddle ! '
with a few strokes [???] brought the boat back to the bank . and sam was
able to scramble out [???] wet as a water - rat . [???] took off the ring and
stepped ashore again .
` of all the confounded [???] you are the worst [???] sam ! ' he said .
' oh [???] mr . [???] [???] that ' s hard ! ' said sam shivering . ` that ' s hard [???] trying
to go without me and all . if i hadn ' t a guessed right [???] where would you be
now ? '
` safely on my way . '
` safely ! ' said sam . ` all alone and without me to help you ? i couldn ' t
have a borne it [???] it ' d have been the death of me . '
' it would be the death of you to come with me [???] sam [???] ' said [???] and i
could not have borne that . '
` not as certain as being left behind [???] ' said sam .
` but i am going to [???] . '
` i know that well enough [???] mr . [???] . of course you are . and i ' m coming
with you . '
` now [???] sam [???] ' said [???] [???] ` don ' t hinder me ! the others will be coming
back at any minute . if they ca tch me here . i shall have to argue and

explain [???] and i shall never have the heart or the chance to get off . but i
must go at once . it ' s the only way . '
` of course it is [???] ' answered sam . ' but not alone . i ' m coming too [???] or
neither of us isn ' t going . i ' ll knock holes in all the boats first . '
[???] actually laughed . a sudden warmth and gladness touched his heart .
` leave one ! ' he said . ` we ' ll need it . but you can ' t come like this without
your gear or food or anything . '
' just hold on a moment [???] and i ' ll get my stuff ! ' cried sam eagerly .
' it ' s all ready . i thought we should be off today . ' he rushed to the camping
place [???] fished out his pack from the pile where [???] had laid it when he
emptied the boat of his companions ' goods [???] a spare blanket [???] and some
extra packages of food [???] and ran back .
` so all my plan is spoilt ! ' said [???] . ` it is no good trying to
escape you . but i ' m glad [???] sam . i cannot tell you how glad . come along ! it is
plain that we were meant to go together . we will go [???] and may the others find
a safe road ! strider will look after them . i don ' t suppose we shall see them
again . '
` yet we may [???] mr [???] . we may [???] ' said sam .
so [???] and sam set off on the last stage of the quest together . [???]
[???] away from the shore [???] and the river bore them swiftly away . down the
western arm [???] and past the frowning cliffs of tol brandir . the roar of the
great falls drew nearer . even with such help as sam could give [???] it was hard
work to pass across the current at the southward end of the island and drive
the boat eastward towards the far shore .
at length they came to land again upon the southern [???] of amon
[???] . there they found a shelving shore [???] and they drew the boat out [???] high
above the water [???] and hid it as well as they could behind a great [???] .
then shouldering their burdens [???] they set off [???] seeking a path that would
bring them over the grey hills of the emyn muil [???] and down into the land of
shadow .



here ends the first part of the history of the war of the ring .
the second part is called the two towers [???] since the events recounted
in it are dominated by orthanc [???] the [???] of [???] [???] and the fortress
of minas [???] that guards the secret entrance to [???] ; it tells of
the deeds and perils of all the members of the now sundered fellowship [???] until
the coming of the great darkness .
the third part tells of the last defence against the shadow [???] and the
end of the mission of the ring - bearer in the return of the king .







* book iii *

chapter 1 . the departure of [???]



[???] sped on up the hill . every now and again he bent to the ground .
[???] go light [???] and their [???] are not easy even for a ranger to
read [???] but not far from the top a spring crossed the path [???] and in the wet
earth he saw what he was seeking .
' i read the signs aright [???] ' he said to himself . ' [???] ran to the
hill - top . i wonder what he saw there ? but he returned by the same way [???] and
went down the hill again . '
[???] [???] . he desired to go to the high seat himself [???] hoping to
see there something that would guide him in his perplexities ; but time was
pressing . suddenly he leaped forward [???] and ran to the summit [???] across the
great flag - stones [???] and up the steps . then sitting in the high seat he looked
out . but the sun seemed darkened [???] and the world dim and remote . he turned
from the north back again to north [???] and saw nothing save the distant hills [???]
unless it were that far away he could see again a great bird like an eagle
high in the air [???] descending slowly in wide circles down towards the earth .
even as he gazed his quick ears caught sounds in the [???] below [???]
on the west side of the river . he stiffened . there were cries [???] and among
them [???] to his horror [???] he could distinguish the harsh voices of [???] . then
suddenly with a deep - throated call a great horn blew [???] and the blasts of it
smote the hills and echoed in the hollows [???] rising in a mighty shout above
the roaring of the falls .
' the horn of [???] ! ' he cried . ' he is in need ! ' he sprang down the
steps and away [???] leaping down the path . ' alas ! an ill fate is on me this day [???]
and all that i do goes amiss . where is sam ? '
as he ran the cries came louder [???] but fainter now and desperately the
horn was blowing . fierce and shrill rose the yells of the [???] [???] and suddenly
the horn - calls ceased . [???] raced down the last slope [???] but before he
could reach the hill ' s foot [???] the sounds died away ; and as he turned to the
left and ran towards them they retreated [???] until at last he could hear them
no more . drawing his bright sword and crying [???] ! [???] ! he [???]
through the trees .

a mile [???] maybe [???] from parth [???] in a little glade not far from the lake
he found [???] . he was sitting with his back to a great tree [???] as if he was
resting . but [???] saw that he was pierced with many black - feathered
arrows ; his sword was still in his hand [???] but it was broken near the hilt ;
his horn cloven in two was at his side . many [???] lay slain [???] piled all about
him and at his feet .
[???] knelt beside him . [???] opened his eyes and strove to speak .
at last slow words came . ' i tried to take the ring from [???] ' he said . ' i
am sorry . i have paid . ' his glance strayed to his fallen enemies ; twenty at
least lay there . ' they have gone : the halflings : the [???] have taken them . i
think they are not dead . [???] bound them . ' he paused and his eyes closed
wearily . after a moment he spoke again .
' farewell [???] [???] ! go to m inas [???] and save my people ! i have
failed . '
' no ! ' said [???] [???] taking his hand and kissing his brow . ' you have
conquered . few have gained such a victory . be at peace ! minas [???] shall
not fall ! '
[???] smiled .
' which way did they go ? was [???] there ? ' said [???] .
but [???] did not speak again .
' alas ! ' said [???] . ' thus passes the heir of [???] [???] lord of the
tower of guard ! this is a bitter end . now the company is all in ruin . it is
i that have failed . vain was [???] ' s trust in me . what shall i do now ?
[???] has laid it on me to go to minas [???] [???] and my heart desires it ;
but where are the ring and the bearer ? how shall i find them and save the
quest from disaster ? '
he knelt for a while [???] bent with weeping [???] still clasping [???] ' s hand .
so it was that legolas and [???] found him . they came from the western
[???] of the hill [???] silently [???] creeping through the trees as if they were
hunting . [???] had his axe in hand [???] and [???] s his long knife : all his
arrows were spent . when they came into the glade they halted in amazement ;
and then they stood a moment with heads bowed in grief [???] for it seemed to
them plain what had happened .
' alas ! ' said legolas [???] coming to [???] ' s side . ' we have hunted and
slain many [???] in the woods [???] but we should have been of more use here . we
came when we heard the horn - but too late [???] it seems . i fear you have taken
deadly hurt . '

' [???] is dead [???] ' said [???] . ' i am [???] [???] for i was not here
with him . he fell defending the [???] [???] while i was away upon the hill . '
' the [???] ! ' cried [???] ' where are they then ? where is [???] ? '
' i do not know [???] ' answered [???] wearily . ' before he died [???] told
me that the [???] had bound them ; he did not think that they were dead . i
sent him to follow merry and [???] ; but i did not ask him if [???] or sam
were with him : not until it was too late . all that i have done today has
gone amiss . what is to be done now ? '
' first we must tend the fallen [???] ' said legolas . ' we cannot leave him
lying like carrion among these foul [???] . '
' but we must be swift [???] ' said [???] . ' he would not wish us to linger . we
must follow the [???] [???] if there is hope that any of our company are living
prisoners . '
' but we do not know whether the ring - bearer is with them or not ' said
[???] . ' are we to abandon him ? must we not seek him first ? an evil choice
is now before us ! '
' then let us do first what we must do [???] ' said legolas . ' we have not the
time or the tools to bury our comrade fitly [???] or to raise a mound over him . a
[???] we might build . '
' the labour would be hard and long : there are no stones that we could
use nearer than the water - side [???] ' said [???] .
' then let us lay him in a boat with his weapons [???] and the weapons of his
vanquished foes [???] ' said [???] . ' we will send him to the falls of [???] and
give him to [???] . the river of [???] will take care at least that no evil
creature dishonours his bones . '
quickly they searched the bodies of the [???] [???] gathering their swords
and cloven helms and shields into a heap . ' see ! ' cried [???] . ' here we
find tokens ! ' he picked out from the pile of grim weapons two knives [???]
leaf - bladed [???] [???] in go ld and red ; and searching further he found also
the sheaths [???] black [???] set with small red gems . ' no orc - tools these ! ' he said .
' they were borne by the [???] . doubtless the [???] [???] them [???] but
feared to keep the knives [???] knowing them for wha t they are : work of
westernesse [???] wound about with spells for the bane of [???] . well [???] now [???] if
they still live [???] our friends are weaponless . i will take these things [???]
hoping against hope [???] to give them back . '
' and i [???] ' said legolas [???] ' will take all the arrows that i can find [???] for
my quiver is empty . ' he searched in the pile and on the ground about and

found not a few that were [???] and longer in the shaft than such arrows
as the [???] were accustomed to use . he looked at them closely .
and [???] looked on the slain [???] and he said : ' here lie many that are
not folk of [???] . some are from the north [???] from the misty mountains [???] if i
know anything of [???] and their kinds . and here are others strange to me .
their gear is not after the manner of [???] at all ! '
there were four [???] - soldiers of greater stature [???] swart [???] slant - eyed [???]
with thick legs and large hands . they were armed with short broad - bladed
swords [???] not with the curved [???] usual with [???] : and they had bows of
yew [???] in length and shape like the bows of men . upon their shields they bore
a strange device : a small white hand in the centre of a black field ; on the
front of their iron helms was set an s - rune [???] wrought of some white metal .
' i have not seen these tokens before [???] ' said [???] . ' what do they
mean ? '
' s is for [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' that is easy to read . '
' nay ! ' said legolas . ' [???] does not use the elf - runes . '
' neither does he use his right name [???] nor permit it to be spelt or
spoken [???] ' said [???] . ' and he does not use white . the [???] in the service
of barad - dyr use the sign of the red eye . ' he stood for a moment in thought .
' s is for [???] [???] i guess [???] ' he said at length . ' there is evil afoot in
[???] [???] and the west is no longer safe . it is as [???] feared : by some
means the traitor [???] has had news of our journey . it is likely too that
he knows of [???] ' s fall . pursuers from moria may have escaped the
[???] of [???] [???] or they may have avoided that land and come to [???]
by other paths . [???] travel fast . but [???] has many ways of learning
news . do you remember the birds ? '
' well [???] we have no time to ponder [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' let us bear
[???] away ! '
' but after that we must guess the [???] [???] if we are to choose our
course rightly [???] ' answered [???] .
' maybe there is no right choice [???] ' said [???] .
taking his axe the dwarf now cut several branches . these they [???]
together with [???] [???] and spread their cloaks upon the frame . upon this
rough bier they carried the body of their companion to the shore [???] together
with such trophies of his last battle as they chose to send forth with him .
it was only a short way [???] yet they found it no easy task [???] for [???] was a
man both tall and strong .

at the water - side [???] remained [???] watching the bier . while legolas
and [???] hastened back on foot to parth [???] . it was a mile or more [???] and
it was some time before they came back [???] paddling two boats swiftly along the
shore .
' there is a strange tale to tell ! ' said legolas . ' there are only two
boats upon the bank . we could find no trace of the other . '
' have [???] been there ? ' asked [???] .
' we saw no signs of them [???] ' answered [???] . ' and [???] would have taken
or destroyed all the boats [???] and the [???] as well . '
' i will look at the ground when we come there [???] ' said [???] .
now they laid [???] in the middle of the boat that was to bear him
away . the grey hood and elven - cloak they folded and placed beneath his head .
they combed his long dark hair and arrayed it upon his shoulders . the golden
belt of [???] gleamed about his waist . his helm they set beside him [???] and
across his lap they laid the cloven horn and the [???] and shards of his
sword ; beneath his feet they put the swords of his enemies . then fastening
the prow to the stern of the other boat [???] they drew him out into the water .
they rowed sadly along the shore [???] and turning into the swift - running channel
they passed the green sward of parth [???] . the steep sides of tol brandir
were glowing : it was now mid - afternoon . as they went south the fume of
[???] rose and [???] before them [???] a haze of gold . the rush and thunder
of the falls shook the windless air .
sorrowfully they cast loose the funeral boat : there [???] lay [???]
restful [???] peaceful [???] gliding upon the bosom of the flowing water . the stream
took him while they held their own boat back with their [???] . he floated
by them [???] and slowly his boat departed [???] waning to a dark spot against the
golden light ; and then suddenly it vanished . [???] roared on [???] .
the river had taken [???] son of [???] [???] and he was not seen again in
minas [???] [???] standing as he used to stand upon the white tower in the
morning . but in [???] in after - days it long was said that the elven - boat
rode the falls and the foaming pool [???] and bore him down through [???] [???]
and past the many mouths of [???] [???] out into the great sea at night under
the stars .
for a while the three companions remained silent [???] gazing after him .
then [???] spoke . ' they will look for him from the white tower [???] ' he said [???]
' but he will not return from mountain or from sea . ' then slowly he began to
sing :

through [???] over fen and field where the long grass grows
the west wind comes walking [???] and about the walls it goes .
' what news from the west [???] o wandering wind [???] do you bring to me tonight ?
have you seen [???] the tall by moon or by starlight ? '
' i saw him ride over seven streams [???] over waters wide and grey ;
i saw him walk in empty lands [???] until he passed away
into the shadows of the north . i saw him then no more .
the north wind may have heard the horn of the son of [???] . '
' o [???] ! from the high walls westward i looked afar [???]
but you came not from the empty lands where no men are . '

then legolas sang :

from the mouths of the sea the south wind flies [???] from the [???] and the stones ;
the wailing of the gulls it bears [???] and at the gate it moans .
' what news from the south [???] o sighing wind [???] do you bring to me at eve ?
where now is [???] the fair ? he tarries and i grieve . '
' ask not of me where he doth dwell - so many bones there lie
on the white shores and the dark shores under the stormy sky ;
so many have passed down [???] to find the flowing sea .
ask of the north wind news of them the north wind sends to me ! '
' o [???] ! beyond the gate the seaward road runs south [???]
but you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey sea ' s mouth . '
then [???] sang again :
from the gate of kings the north wind rides [???] and past the roaring falls ;
and clear and cold about the tower its loud horn calls .
' what news from the north [???] o mighty wind [???] do you bring to me today ?
what news of [???] the bold ? for he is long away . '
' beneath amon hen i heard his cry . there many foes he fought .
his cloven shield [???] his broken sword [???] they to the water brought .
his head so proud [???] his face so fair [???] his limbs they laid to rest ;
and [???] [???] golden [???] - falls [???] bore him upon its breast . '
' o [???] ! the tower of guard shall ever northward gaze
to [???] [???] golden [???] - falls [???] until the end o f days . '

so they ended . then they turned their boat and drove it with all the
speed they could against the stream back to parth [???] .
' you left the east wind to me [???] ' said [???] [???] ' but i will say naught of
it . '
' that is as it should be [???] ' said [???] . ' in minas [???] they endure
the east wind [???] but they do not ask it for tidings . but now [???] has taken

his road . and we must make haste to choose our own . '
he surveyed the green lawn [???] quickly but thoroughly [???] stooping often to
the earth . ' the [???] have been on this ground [???] ' he said . ' otherwise nothing
can be made out for certain . all our [???] are here [???] crossing and
re - crossing . i cannot tell whether any of the [???] have come back since
the search for [???] began . ' he returned to the bank [???] close to where the
rill from the spring trickled out into the river . ' there are some clear
prints here [???] ' he said . ' a hobbit waded out into the water and back ; but i
cannot say how long ago . '
' how then do you read this riddle ? ' asked [???] .
[???] did not answer at once [???] but went back to the camping - place and
looked at the [???] . ' two packs are missing . ' he said [???] ' and one is
certainly sam ' s : it was rather large and heavy . this then is the answe r :
[???] has gone by boat [???] and his servant has gone with him . [???] must have
returned while we were all away . i met sam going up the hill and told him to
follow me ; but plainly he did not do so . he guessed his master s mind and
came back here before [???] had gone . he did not find it easy to leave sam
behind ! '
' but why should he leave us behind [???] and without a word ? ' said [???] .
' that was a strange deed ! '
' and a brave deed [???] ' said [???] . ' sam was right [???] i think . [???] did
not wish to lead any friend to death with him in [???] . but he knew that he
must go himself . something happened after he left us that overcame his fear
and doubt . '
' maybe hunting [???] came on him and he fled [???] ' said legolas .
' he fled [???] certainly [???] ' said [???] [???] ' but not [???] i think [???] from [???] . ' what
he thought was the cause of [???] ' s sudden resolve and flight [???] did
not say . the last words of [???] he long kept secret .
' well [???] so much at least is now clear [???] ' said legolas : ' [???] is no
longer on this side of the river : only he can have taken the boat . and sam
is with him ; only he would have taken his pack . '
' our choice then [???] ' said [???] [???] ' is either to take the remaining boat
and follow [???] [???] or else to follow the [???] on foot . there is little hope
either way . we have already lost precious hours . '
' let me think ! ' said [???] . ' and now may i make a right choice and
change the evil fate of this unhappy day ! ' he stood silent for a moment . ' i
will follow the [???] [???] ' he said at last . ' i would have guided [???] to [???]

and gone with him to the end ; but if i seek him now in the wilderness [???] i
must abandon the captives to torment and death . my heart speaks clearly at
last : the fate of the bearer is in my hands no longer . the company has
played its part . yet we that remain cannot forsake our companions while we
have strength left . come ! we will go now . leave all that can be spared
behind ! we will press on by day and dark ! '
they drew up the last boat and carried it to the trees . they laid
beneath it such of their goods as they did not need and could not carry
away . then they left parth [???] . the afternoon was fading as they came back
to the glade where [???] had fallen . there they picked up the trail of the
[???] . it needed little skill to find .
' no other folk make such a trampling [???] ' said legolas . ' it seems their
delight to slash and beat down growing things that are not even in their
way . '
' but they go with a great speed for all that [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and they
do not tire . and later we may have to search for our path in hard bare
lands . '
' well [???] after them ! ' said [???] . ' [???] too can go swiftly [???] and they
do not tire sooner than [???] . but it will be a long chase : they have a long
start . '
' yes [???] ' said [???] [???] ' we shall all need the endurance of [???] . but
come ! with hope or without hope we will follow the trail of our enemies . and
woe to them [???] if we prove the swifter ! we will make such a chase as shall be
accounted a marvel among the three kindreds [???] elves . [???] [???] and men .
forth
the three hunters ! '
like a deer he sprang away . through the trees he sped . on and on he led
them [???] tireless and swift [???] now that his mind was at last made up . the woods
about the lake they left behind . long [???] they climbed [???] dark [???] hard - edged
against the sky already red with sunset . [???] came . they passed away [???] grey
shadows in a stony land .




chapter 2 . the riders of [???]



[???] deepened . mist lay behind them among the trees below [???] and brooded
on the pale margins of the [???] [???] but the sky was clear . stars came out .
the waxing moon was riding in the west [???] and the shadows of the rocks were
black . they had come to the feet of stony hills [???] and their pace was slower [???]
for the trail was no longer easy to follow . here the [???] of the emyn
muil ran from north to south in two long tumbled ridges . the western side of
each ridge was steep and difficult [???] but the eastward [???] were gentler [???]
[???] with many gullies and narrow ravines . all night the three
companions [???] in this bony land [???] climbing to the crest of the first
and tallest ridge [???] and down again into the darkness of a deep winding valley
on the other side .
there in the still cool hour before dawn they rested for a brief space .
the moon had long gone down before them [???] the stars glittered above them ; the
first light of day had not yet come over the dark hills behind . for the
moment [???] was at a loss : the orc - trail had descended into the valley [???]
but there it had vanished .
' which way would they turn [???] do you think ? ' said legolas . ' northward to
take a straighter road to [???] [???] or fangorn [???] if that is their aim as you
guess ? or southward to strike the [???] ? '
' they will not make for the river [???] whatever mark they aim at ' ' said
[???] . ' and unless there is much amiss in [???] and the power of [???]
is greatly increased ; they will take the shortest way that they can find
over the fields of the [???] . let us search northwards ! '
the dale ran like a stony trough between the ridged hills [???] and a
trickling stream flowed among the [???] at the bottom . a cliff frowned
upon their right ; to their left rose grey [???] [???] dim and shadowy in the
late night . they went on for a mile or more northwards . [???] was
searching . bent towards the ground [???] among the folds and gullies leading up
into the western ridge . legolas was some way ahead . suddenly the elf gave a
cry and the others came running towards him .
' we have already overtaken some of those that we are hunting [???] ' he said .
' look ! ' he pointed [???] and they saw that what they had at first taken to be
[???] lying at the foot of the slope were [???] bodies . five dead [???]

lay there . they had been hewn with many cruel strokes [???] and two had been
[???] . the ground was wet with their dark blood .
' here is another riddle ! ' said [???] . ' but it needs the light of day
and for that we cannot wait . '
' yet however you read it [???] it seems not [???] [???] ' said legolas .
' enemies of the [???] are likely to be our friends . do any folk dwell in
these hills ? '
' no [???] ' said [???] . ' the [???] seldom come here [???] and it is far from
minas [???] . it might be that some company of men were hunting here for
reasons that we do not know . yet i think not . '
' what do you think ? ' said [???] .
' i think that the enemy brought his own enemy with him [???] ' answered
[???] . ' these are northern [???] from far away . among the slain are none of
the great [???] with the strange badges . there was a quarrel [???] i guess : it is
no [???] thing with these foul folk . maybe there was some dispute about
the road . '
' or about the captives [???] ' said [???] . ' let us hope that they [???] too [???] did
not meet their end here . '
[???] searched the ground in a wide circle [???] but no other traces of
the fight could be found . they went on . already the eastward sky was turning
pale ; the stars were fading [???] and a grey light was slowly growing . a little
further north they came to a fold in which a tiny stream [???] falling and
winding [???] had cut a stony path down into the valley . in it some bushes grew [???]
and there were patches of grass upon its sides .
' at last ! ' said [???] . ' here are the tracks that we seek ! up this
water - channel : this is the way that the [???] went after their debate . '
swiftly now the pursuers turned and followed the new path . as if fresh
from a night ' s rest they sprang from stone to stone . at last they reached
the crest of the grey hill [???] and a sudden breeze blew in their hair and
stirred their cloaks : the chill wind of dawn .
turning back they saw across the river the far hills kindled . day
leaped into the sky . the red rim of the sun rose over the shoulders of the
dark land . before them in the west the world lay still [???] formless and grey ;
but even as they looked [???] the shadows of night melted [???] the colours of the
waking earth returned : green flowed over the wide meads of [???] ; the white
mists [???] in the [???] ; and far off to the left [???] thirty leagues
or more [???] blue and purple stood the white mountains [???] rising into peaks of

jet [???] tipped with [???] snows [???] [???] with the rose of morning .
' [???] ! [???] ! ' cried [???] . ' would that i looked on you again in
happier hour ! not yet does my road lie southward to your bright streams .
[???] ! [???] [???] between the mountains and the sea !
west wind blew there ; the light upon the silver tree
fell like bright rain in gardens of the kings of old .
o proud walls ! white towers ! o winged crown and throne of gold !
o [???] [???] [???] ! shall men behold the silver tree [???]
or west wind blow again between the mountains and the sea ?
now let us go ! ' he said [???] drawing his eyes away from the south [???] and
looking out west and north to the way that he must tread .
the ridge upon which the companions stood went down steeply before
their feet . below it twenty fathoms or more [???] there was a wide and rugged
shelf which ended suddenly in the brink of a sheer cliff : the east wall of
[???] . so ended the emyn muil [???] and the green plains of the [???]
stretched away before them to the edge of sight .
' look ! ' cried legolas [???] pointing up into the pale sky above them . ' there
is the eagle again ! he is very high . he seems to be flying now away [???] from
this land back to the north . he is going with great speed . look ! '
' no [???] not even my eyes can see him [???] my good legolas [???] ' said [???] . ' he
must be far aloft indeed . i wonder what is his errand [???] if he is the same
bird that i have seen before . but look ! i can see something nearer at hand
and more urgent ; there is something moving over the plain ! '
' many things [???] ' said legolas . ' it is a great company on foot ; but i
cannot say more [???] nor see what kind of folk they may be . they are many
leagues away : twelve [???] i guess ; but the flatness of the plain is hard to
measure . '
' i think [???] nonetheless [???] that we no longer need any trail to tell us
which way to go [???] ' said [???] . ' let us find a path down to the fields as
quick as may be . '
' i doubt if you will find a path quicker than the one that the [???]
chose [???] ' said [???] .
they followed their enemies now by the clear light of day . it seemed
that the [???] had pressed on with all possible speed . every now and again
the pursuers found things that had been dropped or cast away : food - bags [???] the
[???] and [???] of hard grey bread . a torn black cloak [???] a heavy iron - nailed
shoe broken on the stones . the trail led them north along the top of the

[???] [???] and at length they came to a deep cleft carved in the rock by a
stream that [???] noisily down . in the narrow ravine a rough path
descended like a steep stair into the plain .
at the bottom they came with a strange suddenness on the grass of
[???] . it swelled like a green sea up to the very foot of the emyn muil . the
falling stream vanished into a deep growth of cresses and water - plants [???] and
they could hear it tinkling away in green [???] [???] down long gentle [???]
towards the fens of [???] vale far away . they seemed to have left winter
[???] to the hills behind . here the air was softer and warmer [???] and
faintly scented [???] as if spring was already stirring and the sap was flowing
again in herb and leaf . legolas took a deep breath [???] like one that drinks a
great draught after long thirst in barren places .
' ah ! the green smell ! ' he said . ' it is better than much sleep . let us
run ! '
' light feet may run swiftly here [???] ' said [???] . ' more swiftly [???] maybe [???]
than iron - shod [???] . now we have a chance to lessen their lead ! '
they went in single file [???] running like hounds on a strong scent [???] and an
eager light was in their eyes . nearly due west the broad swath of the
marching [???] tramped its ugly slot ; the sweet grass of [???] had been
bruised and blackened as they passed . presently [???] gave a cry and
turned aside . ' stay ! ' he shouted . ' do not follow me yet ! ' he ran quickly to
the right [???] away from the main trail ; for he had seen [???] that went
that way [???] branching off from the others [???] the marks of small unshod feet .
these [???] however [???] did not go far before they were crossed by orc - prints [???] also
coming out from the main trail behind and in front [???] and then they curved
sharply back again and were lost in the trampling . at the furthest point
[???] stooped and picked up something from the grass ; then he ran back .
' yes [???] ' he said [???] ' they are quite plain : a hobbit ' s [???] . [???] ' s
i think . he is smaller than the other . and look at this ! he held up a thing
that glittered in the sunlight . it looked like the new - opened leaf of a
beech - tree [???] fair and strange in that treeless plain .
' the brooch of an elven - cloak ! ' cried legolas and [???] together .
' not idly do the leaves of [???] fall [???] ' said [???] . ' this did not
drop by chance : it was cast away as a token to any that might follow . i
think [???] ran away from the trail for that purpose . '
' then he at least was alive [???] ' said [???] . ' and he had the use of his
wits [???] and of his legs too . that is heartening . we do not pursue in vain . '

' let us hope that he did not pay too dearly for his boldness [???] ' said
legolas . ' c ome ! let us go on ! the thought of those merry young folk driven
like cattle burns my heart . '
the sun climbed to the noon and then rode slowly down the sky . light
clouds came up out of the sea in the distant south and were blown away upon
the breeze . the sun sank . shadows rose behind and reached out long arms from
the east . still the hunters held on . one day now had passed since [???]
fell [???] and the [???] were yet far ahead . no longer could any sight of them be
seen in the level plains .
as [???] was closing about them [???] halted . only twice in the
day ' s march had they rested for a brief while [???] and twelve leagues now lay
between them and the eastern wall where they had stood at dawn .
' we have come at last to a hard choice [???] ' he said . ' shall we rest by
night [???] or shall we go on while our will and strength hold ? '
' unless our enemies rest also [???] they will leave us far behind [???] if we
stay to sleep . ' said legolas . ' surely even [???] must pause on the march ? '
said [???] . ' seldom will [???] journey in the open under the sun . yet these
have done so [???] ' said legolas . ' certainly they will not rest by night . '
' but if we walk by night [???] we cannot follow their trail [???] ' said [???] .
' the trail is straight [???] and turns neither right nor left [???] as far as my
eyes can see [???] ' said legolas .
' maybe [???] i could lead you at guess in the darkness and hold to the
line [???] ' said [???] ; ' but if we strayed [???] or they turned aside [???] then when
light came there might be long delay before the trail was found again . '
' and there is this also [???] ' said [???] : ' only by day can we see if any
tracks lead away . if a prisoner should escape [???] or if one should be carried
off [???] eastward [???] say [???] to the great river [???] towards [???] [???] we might pass the
signs and never know it . '
' that is true [???] ' said [???] . ' but if i read the signs back yonder
rightly [???] the [???] of the white hand prevailed [???] and the whole company is now
bound for [???] . their present course bears me out . '
' yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsels [???] ' said [???] . ' and
what of escape ? in the dark we should have passed the signs that led you to
the brooch . '
' the [???] will be doubly on their guard since then [???] and the prisoners
even wearier [???] ' said legolas . ' there will be no escape again [???] if we do not
contrive it . how that is to be done cannot be guessed [???] but first we must

overtake them . '
' and yet even i [???] dwarf of many journeys [???] and not the least hardy of my
folk [???] cannot run all the way to [???] without any pause ' said [???] . ' my
heart burns me too [???] and i would have started sooner but now i must rest a
little to run the better . and if we rest [???] then the blind night is the time
to do so . '
' i said that it was a hard choice [???] ' said [???] . ' how shall we end
this debate ? '
' you are our guide [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and you are skilled in the chase . you
shall choose . '
' my heart bids me go on [???] ' said legolas . ' but we must hold together . i
will follow your counsel . '
' you give the choice to an ill chooser [???] ' said [???] . ' since we passed
through the [???] my choices have gone amiss . ' he fell silent gazing
north and west into the gathering night for a long while .
' we will not walk in the dark [???] ' he said at length . ' the peril of
missing the trail or signs of other coming and going seems to me the
greater . if the moon gave enough light [???] we would use it [???] but alas ! he sets
early and is yet young and pale . '
' and tonight he is shrouded anyway [???] ' [???] murmured . ' would that the
lady had given us a light [???] such a gift as she gave to [???] ! '
' it will be more needed where it is bestowed [???] ' said [???] . ' with him
lies the true quest . ours is but a small matter in the great deeds of this
time . a vain pursuit from its beginning [???] maybe [???] which no choice of mine can
mar or mend . well [???] i have chosen . so let us use the time as best we may ! '
he cast himself on the ground and fell at once into sleep [???] for he had
not slept since their night under the shadow of tol brandir . before dawn was
in the sky he woke and rose . [???] was still deep in slumber [???] but legolas
was standing [???] gazing northwards into the darkness [???] thoughtful and silent as
a young tree in a windless night .
' they are far far away [???] ' he said sadly [???] turning to [???] . ' i know in
my heart that they have not rested this night . only an eagle could overtake
them now . '
' nonetheless we will still follow as we may [???] ' said [???] . stooping he
roused the dwarf . ' come ! we must go [???] ' he said . ' the scent is growing cold . '
' but it is still dark [???] ' said [???] . ' even legolas on a hill - top could
not see them till the sun is up . '

' i fear they have passed beyond my sight from hill or plain [???] under moon
or sun [???] ' said legolas .
' where sight fails the earth may bring us rumour [???] ' said [???] . ' the
land must groan under their hated feet . ' he stretched himself upon the
ground with his ear pressed against the turf . he lay there motionless [???] for
so long a time that [???] wondered if he had swooned or fallen asleep again .
dawn came [???] [???] and slowly a grey light grew about them . at last he
rose [???] and now his friends could see his face : it was pale and drawn [???] and his
look was troubled .
' the rumour of the earth is dim and confused [???] ' he said . ' nothing walks
upon it for many miles about us . faint and far are the feet of our enemies .
but loud are the [???] of the horses . it comes to my mind that i heard them [???]
even as i lay on the ground in sleep [???] and they troubled my dreams : hor ses
[???] [???] passing in the west . but now they are drawing ever further from
us [???] riding northward . i wonder what is happening in this land ! '
' let us go ! ' said legolas .
so the third day of their pursuit began . during all its long hours of
cloud and fitful sun they hardly paused [???] now striding [???] now running [???] as if no
weariness could quench the fire that burned them . they seldom spoke . over
the wide solitude they passed and their elven - cloaks faded against the
background of the grey - green fields ; even in the cool sunlight of mid - day
few but elvish eyes would have marked them [???] until they were close at hand .
often in their hearts they thanked the lady of [???] for the gift of
[???] [???] for they could eat of it and find new strength even as they ran .
all day the track of their enemies led straight on [???] going north - west
without a break or turn . as once again the day wore to its end they came to
long treeless [???] [???] where the land rose [???] swelling up towards a line of low
[???] downs ahead . the orc - trail grew fainter as it bent north towards
them [???] for the ground became harder and the grass shorter . far away to the
left the river [???] wound [???] a silver thread in a green floor . no moving
thing could be seen . often [???] wondered that they saw no sign of beast
or man . the dwellings of the [???] were for the most part many leagues
away to the south [???] under the wooded eaves of the white mountains [???] now
hidden
in mist and cloud ; yet the horse - lords had formerly kept many herds and
studs in the [???] [???] this [???] region of their realm [???] and there the
[???] had wandered much [???] living in camp and tent [???] even in winter - time .

but now all the land was empty [???] and there was silence that did not seem to
be the quiet of peace .
at [???] they halted again . now twice twelve leagues they had passed
over the plains of [???] and the wall of the emyn muil was lost in the
shadows of the east . the young moon was [???] in a misty sky [???] but it
gave small light [???] and the stars were veiled .
' now do i most grudge a time of rest or any halt in our chase ' said
legolas . ' the [???] have run before us [???] as if the very whips of [???] were
behind them . i fear they have already reached the forest and the dark hills [???]
and even now are passing into the shadows of the trees . '
[???] ground his teeth . ' this is a bitter end to our hope and to all
our toil ! ' he said .
' to hope [???] maybe [???] but not to toil [???] ' said [???] . ' we shall not turn
back here . yet i am weary . ' he gazed back along the way that they had come
towards the night gathering in the east . ' there is something strange at work
in this land . i distrust the silence . i distrust even the pale moon . the
stars are faint ; and i am weary a s i have seldom been before [???] weary as no
ranger should be with a clear trail to follow . there is some will that lends
speed to our foes and sets an unseen barrier before us : a weariness that is
in the heart more than in the limb . '
' truly ! ' said legolas . ' that i have known since first we came down from
the emyn muil . for the will is not behind us but before us . ' he pointed away
over the land of [???] into the darkling west under the sickle moon .
' [???] ! ' muttered [???] . ' but he shall not turn us back ! halt we must
once more ; for [???] see ! even the moon is falling into gathering cloud . but
north lies our road between down and fen when day returns . '
as before legolas was first afoot [???] if indeed he had ever slept . ' awake !
awake ! ' he cried . ' it is a red dawn . strange things [???] us by the eaves of
the forest . good or evil [???] i do not know ; but we are called . awake ! '
the others sprang up [???] and almost at once they set off again . slowly the
downs drew near . it was still an hour before noon when they reached them :
green [???] rising to bare ridges that ran in a line straight towards the
north . at their feet the ground was dry and the turf short [???] but a long strip
of sunken land [???] some ten miles wide [???] lay between them and the river
wandering deep in dim thickets of reed and rush . just to the west of the
[???] slope there was a great ring [???] where the turf had been torn and
beaten by many trampling feet . from it the orc - trail ran out again [???] turning

north along the dr y skirts of the hills . [???] halted and examined the
tracks closely .
' they rested here a while [???] ' he said [???] ' but even the outward trail is
already old . i fear that your heart spoke truly [???] legolas : it is thrice
twelve hours [???] i guess [???] since the [???] stood where we now stand . if they held
to their pace [???] then at sundown yesterday they would reach the borders of
fangorn . '
' i can see nothing away north or west but grass [???] into mist [???] '
said [???] . ' could we see the forest [???] if we climbed the hills ? '
' it is still far away [???] ' said [???] . ' if i remember rightly [???] these
downs run eight leagues or more to the north [???] and then north - west to the
issuing of the [???] there lies still a wide land . another fifteen leagues
it may be . '
' well [???] let us go on [???] ' said [???] . ' my legs must forget the miles . they
would be more willing [???] if my heart were less heavy . '
the sun was sinking when at last they drew near to the end of the line
of downs . for many hours they had marched without rest . they were going
slowly now [???] and [???] ' s back was bent . stone - hard are the [???] in labour
or journey [???] but this endless chase began to tell on him [???] as all hope failed
in his heart . [???] walked behind him [???] grim and silent [???] stooping now and
again to scan some print or mark upon the ground . only legolas still stepped
as lightly as ever [???] his feet hardly seeming to press the grass . leaving no
[???] as he passed ; but in the [???] of the elves he found all the
sustenance tha t he needed [???] and he could sleep [???] if sleep it could be called
by men [???] resting his mind in the strange paths of elvish dreams [???] even as he
walked open - eyed in the light of this world .
' let us go up on to this green hill ! ' he said . wearily they fol lowed
him [???] climbing the long slope [???] until they came out upon the top . it was a
round hill smooth and bare [???] standing by itself [???] the most [???] of the
downs . the sun sank and the shadows of evening fell like a curtain . they
were alone in a gr ey formless world without mark or measure . only far away
north - west there was a deeper darkness against the dying light : the
mountains of mist and the forest at their feet .
' nothing can we see to guide us here [???] ' said [???] . ' well [???] now we must
halt again and wear the night away . it is growing cold ! '
' the wind is north from the snows [???] ' said [???] .
' and ere morning it will be in the east [???] ' said legolas . ' but rest if

you must . yet do not cast all hope away . tomorrow is unknown . rede oft is
found at the rising of the sun . '
' three suns already have risen on our chase and brought no counsel '
said [???] .
the night grew ever colder . [???] and [???] slept fitfully [???] and
whenever they awoke they saw legolas standing beside them [???] or walking to
and
fro [???] singing softly to himself in his own tongue [???] and as he sang the white
stars opened in the hard black vault above . so the night passed . together
they watched the dawn grow slowly in the sky [???] now bare and cloudless [???] until
at last the [???] came . it was pale and clear . the wind was in the east
and all the mists had rolled away ; wide lands lay bleak about them in the
bitter light .
ahead and eastward they saw the windy [???] of the wold of [???] that
they had already [???] many days ago from the great river . north -
westward
stalked the dark forest of fangorn ; still ten leagues away stood its shadowy
eaves [???] and its further [???] faded into the distant blue . beyond there
[???] far away [???] as if floating on a grey cloud [???] the white head of tall
[???] [???] the last peak of the misty mountains . out of the forest the
[???] flowed to meet them [???] its stream now swift and narrow [???] and its banks
deep - cloven . the orc - trail turned from the downs towards it .
following with his keen eyes the trail to the river [???] and then the river
back towards the forest [???] [???] saw a shadow on the distant green [???] a dark
swift - moving blur . he cast himself upon the ground and listened again
intently . but legolas stood beside him [???] shading his bright elven - eyes with
his long slender hand [???] and he saw not a shadow [???] nor a blur [???] but the small
figures of horsemen [???] many horsemen [???] and the glint of morning on the tips of
their spears was like the [???] of minute stars beyond the edge of mortal
sight . far behind them a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads .
there was a silence in the empty fields [???] arid [???] could hear the air
moving in the grass .
' riders ! ' cried [???] [???] springing to his feet . ' many riders on swift
steeds are coming towards us ! '
' yes [???] ' said legolas [???] ' there are one hundred and five . yellow is their
hair [???] and bright are their spears . their leader is very tall . '
[???] smiled . ' keen are the eyes of the elves [???] ' he said .

' nay ! the riders are little more than five leagues distant [???] ' said
legolas .
' five leagues or one [???] ' said [???] ; ' we cannot escape them in this bare
land . shall we wait for them here or go on our way ? '
' we will wait [???] ' said [???] . ' i am weary [???] and our hunt has failed . or
at least others were before us ; for these horsemen are riding back down the
orc - trail . we may get new s from them . '
' or spears [???] ' said [???] .
' there are three empty saddles [???] but i see no [???] [???] ' said legolas .
' i did not say that we should hear good news [???] ' said [???] . ' but evil
or good we will [???] it here . '
the three companions now left the hill - top [???] where they might be an easy
mark against the pale sky [???] and they walked slowly down the northward slope .
a little above the hill ' s foot they halted [???] and wrapping their cloaks about
them [???] they sat [???] together upon the faded grass . the time passed slowly
and heavily . the wind was thin and searching . [???] was uneasy .
' what do you know of these horsemen [???] [???] ? ' he said . ' do we sit here
waiting for sudden death ? '
' i have been among them [???] ' answered [???] . ' they are proud and wilful [???]
but they are true - hearted [???] generous in thought and deed ; bold but not cruel ;
wise but [???] [???] writing no books but singing many songs [???] after the
manner of the children of men before the dark years . but i do not know what
has happened here of late [???] nor in what mind the [???] may now be between
the traitor [???] and the threat of [???] . they have long been the
friends of the people of [???] [???] though they are not akin to them . it was in
forgotten years long ago that [???] the young brought them out of the north [???]
and their kinship is rather with the bardings of dale [???] and with the
[???] of the wood [???] among whom may still be seen many men tall and
fair [???]
as are the riders of [???] . at least they will not love the [???] . '
' but [???] spoke of a rumour that they pay tribute to [???] ' said
[???] .
' i believe it no more than did [???] [???] ' answered [???] .
' you will soon learn the truth [???] ' said legolas . ' already they approach . '
at length even [???] could hear the distant beat of [???] [???] .
the horsemen [???] following the trail [???] had turned from the river [???] and were
drawing near the downs . they were riding like the wind .

now the cries of clear strong voices came ringing over the fields .
suddenly they swept up with a noise like thunder [???] and the foremost horseman
[???] [???] passing by the foot of the hill [???] and leading the host back
southward along the western skirts of the downs . after him they rode : a long
line of mail - clad men . swift [???] shining [???] fell and fair to look upon .
their horses were of great stature [???] strong and clean - limbed ; their grey
coats [???] [???] their long tails flowed in the wind [???] their manes were
braided on their proud necks . the men that rode them matched them well : tall
and long - limbed ; their hair [???] [???] - pale [???] flowed under their light helms [???]
and streamed in long braids behind them ; their faces were stern and keen . in
their hands were tall spears of ash [???] painted shields were slung at their
backs [???] long swords were at their belts [???] their burnished skirts of mail hung
down upon their knees .
in pairs they [???] by [???] and though every now and then one rose in
his [???] and gazed ahead and to either side [???] they appeared not to
perceive the three strangers sitting silently and watching them . the host
had almost passed when suddenly [???] st ood up [???] and called in a loud
voice :
' what news from the north [???] riders of [???] ? '
with astonishing speed and skill they checked their steeds [???] wheeled [???]
and came charging round . soon the three companions found themselves in a
ring of horsemen moving in a running circle [???] up the hill - slope behind them
and down [???] round and round them [???] and drawing ever inwards . [???] stood
silent [???] and the other two sat without moving [???] wondering what way things
would turn .
without a word or cry [???] suddenly [???] the riders halted . a thicket of spears
were pointed towards the strangers ; and some of the horsemen had bows in
hand [???] and their arrows were already fitted to the string . then one rode
forward [???] a tall man [???] taller than all the rest ; from his helm as a crest a
white [???] flowed . he advanced until the point of his spear was within
a foot of [???] ' s breast . [???] did not stir .
' who are you [???] and what are you doing in this land ? ' said the rider [???]
using the common speech of the west [???] in manner and tone like to the speech
of [???] [???] man of [???] .
' i am called strider [???] ' answered [???] . ' i came out of the north . i am
hunting [???] . '
the rider leaped from his horse . giving his spear to another who rode

up and [???] at his side [???] he drew his sword and stood face to face with
[???] [???] surveying him keenly [???] and not without wonder . at length he spoke
again .
' at first i thought that you yourselves were [???] [???] ' he said ; ' but now i
see that it is not so . indeed you know little of [???] [???] if you go hunting
them in this fashion . they were swift and well - armed [???] and they were many .
you would have changed from hunters to prey [???] if ever you had overtaken them .
but there is something strange about you [???] strider . ' he bent his clear bright
eyes again upon the ranger . ' that is no name for a man that you give . and
strange too is your raiment . have you sprung out of the grass ? how did you
escape our sight ? are you elvish folk ? '
' no [???] ' said [???] . ' one only of us is an elf [???] legolas from the
woodland realm in distant [???] . but we have passed through
[???] [???]
and the gifts and favour of the lady go with us . '
the rider looked at them with renewed wonder [???] but his eyes hardened .
' then there is a lady in the golden wood [???] as old tales tell ! ' he said . ' few
escape her nets [???] they say . these are strange days ! but if you have her
favour [???] then you also are net - [???] and [???] [???] maybe . ' he turned a
cold glance suddenly upon legolas and [???] . ' why do you not speak [???] silent
ones ? ' he demanded .
[???] rose and planted his feet firmly apart : his hand gripped the
handle of his axe [???] and his dark eyes flashed . ' give me your name [???]
horse - master [???] and i will give you mine [???] and more besides [???] ' he said .
' as for that [???] ' said the rider [???] staring down at the dwarf [???] ' the stranger
should declare himself first . yet i am named jomer son of jomund [???] and am
called the third marshal of [???] . '
' then jomer son of jomund [???] third marshal of [???] [???] let [???] the
dwarf [???] ' s son warn you against foolish words . you speak evil of that
which is fair beyond the reach of your thought [???] and only little wit can
excuse you . '
jomer ' s eyes blazed [???] and the men of [???] murmured angrily [???] and closed
in [???] advancing their spears . ' i would cut off your head [???] beard and all [???]
master dwarf [???] if it stood but a little higher from the ground ' said jomer .
' he stands not alone [???] ' said legolas [???] bending his bow and fitting an
arrow with hands that moved quicker than sight . ' you would die before your
stroke fell . '

jomer raised his sword [???] and things might have gone ill [???] but [???]
sprang between them [???] and raised his hand . ' your pardon [???] jomer ! ' he cried .
' when you know more you will understand why you have angered my
companions .
we intend no evil to [???] [???] nor to any of its folk [???] neither to man nor to
horse . will you not hear our tale before you strike ? '
' i will [???] ' said jomer lowering his blade . ' bu t wanderers in the
[???] would be wise to be less haughty in these days of doubt . first
tell me your right name . '
' first tell me whom you serve [???] ' said [???] . ' are you friend or foe of
[???] [???] the dark lord of [???] ? '
' i serve only the lord of the mark [???] [???] king son of [???] [???] '
answered jomer . ' we do not serve the power of the black land far away [???] but
neither are we yet at open war with him ; and if you are [???] from him [???]
then you had best leave this land . there is trouble now on all our borders [???]
and we are threatened ; but we desire only to be free [???] and to live as we have
lived [???] keeping our own [???] and serving no foreign lord [???] good or evil . we
welcomed guests kindly in the better days [???] but in these times the [???]
stranger finds us swift and hard . come ! who are you ? whom do you serve ?
at
whose command do you hunt [???] in our land ? '
' i serve no man [???] ' said [???] ; ' but the servants of [???] i pursue
into whatever land they may go . there are few among mortal men who know
more
of [???] ; and i do not hunt them in this fashion out of choice . the [???] whom
we pursued took captive two of my friends . in such need a man that has no
horse will go on foot [???] and he will not ask for leave to follow the trail .
nor will he count the heads of the enemy save with a sword . i am not
weaponless . '
[???] threw back his cloak . the elven - sheath glittered as he grasped
it [???] and the bright blade of and [???] ril shone like a sudden flame as he swept it
out . ' [???] ! ' he cried . ' i am [???] son of [???] and am called
[???] [???] the [???] [???] d [???] [???] [???] the heir of [???] [???] ' s son of [???] .
here is the sword that was broken and is forged again ! will you aid me or
thwart me ? choose swiftly ! '
[???] and legolas looked at their companion in amazement [???] for they had
not seen him in this mood before . he seemed to have grown in stature while

jomer had shrunk ; and in his living face they caught a brief vision of the
power and majesty of the kings of stone . for a moment it seemed to the eyes
of legolas that a white flame [???] on the brows of [???] like a
shining crown .
jomer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face . he cast down his
proud eyes . ' these are indeed strange days [???] ' he muttered . ' dreams and
[???] spring to life out of the grass .
' tell me [???] lord [???] ' he said [???] ' what brings you here ? and what was the
meaning of the dark words ? long has [???] son of [???] been gone
seeking an answer [???] and the horse that we lent him came back riderless . what
doom do you bring out of the north ? '
' the doom of choice [???] ' said [???] . ' you may say this to [???] son of
[???] : open war lies before him [???] with [???] or against him . none may live
now as they ha ve lived [???] and few shall keep what they call their own . but of
these great matters we will speak later . if chance allows [???] i will come
myself to the king . now i am in great need [???] and i ask for help [???] or at least
for tidings . you heard that we are pursuing an orc - host that carried off our
friends . what can you tell us ? '
' that you need not pursue them further [???] ' said jomer . ' the [???] are
destroyed . '
' and our friends ? '
' we found none but [???] . '
' but that is strange indeed [???] ' said [???] . ' did you search the slain ?
were there no bodies other than those of orc - kind ? they would be small . only
children to your eyes [???] unshod but clad in grey . '
' there were no [???] nor children [???] ' said jomer . ' we counted all the
slain and [???] them [???] and then we piled the [???] and burned them [???] as
is our custom . the ashes are smoking still . '
' we do not speak of [???] or children [???] ' said [???] . ' our friends were
[???] . '
' [???] ? ' said jomer . ' and what may they be ? it is a strange name . '
' a strange name for a strange folk [???] ' said [???] . ' but these were very
dear to us . it seems that you have heard in [???] of the words that troubled
minas [???] . they spoke of the halfling . these [???] are halflings . '
' halflings ! ' laughed the rider that stood beside jomer . ' halflings ! but
they are only a little people in old songs and children ' s tales out of the
north . do we walk in [???] or on the green earth in the daylight ? '

' a man may do both [???] ' said [???] . ' for not we bu t those who come after
will make the [???] of our time . the green earth [???] say you ? that is a
mighty matter of legend [???] though you tread it under the light of day ! '
' time is pressing [???] ' said the rider [???] not heeding [???] . ' we must
hasten south [???] lord . let us leave these wild folk to their fancies . or let us
bind them and take them to the king . '
' peace [???] [???] ! ' said jomer in his own tongue . ' leave me a while . tell
the jored to assemble on the path ' and make ready to ride to the [???] . '
muttering [???] retired [???] and spoke to the others . soon they drew off
and left jomer alone with the three companions .
' all that you say is strange [???] [???] . ' he said . ' yet you speak the
truth [???] that is plain : the men of the mark do not lie [???] and therefore they are
not easily deceived . but you have not told all . will you not now speak more
fully of your errand [???] so that i may judge what to do ? '
' i set out from [???] [???] as it is named in the rhyme [???] many weeks ago [???] '
answered [???] . ' with me went [???] of minas [???] . my errand was to
go
to that city with the son of [???] [???] to aid his folk in their war against
[???] . but the company that i journeyed with had other business . of that i
cannot speak now . [???] the grey was our leader . '
' [???] ! ' jomer exclaimed . ' [???] [???] is known in the mark : but
his name [???] i warn you [???] is no longer a [???] to the king ' s favour . he has
been a guest in the land many times in the memory of men [???] coming as he will [???]
after a season [???] or after many years . he is ever the herald of strange
events : a bringer of evil [???] some now say .
' indeed since his last coming in the summer all things have gone amiss .
at that time our trouble with [???] began . until then we counted [???]
our friend [???] hut [???] came then and warned us that sudden war was
preparing in [???] . he said that he himself had been a prisoner in
orthanc and had hardly escaped [???] and he begged for help . but [???] would
not listen to him [???] and he went away . speak not the name of [???] loudly in
[???] ' s ears ! he is wroth . for [???] took the horse that is called
[???] [???] the most precious of all the king ' s steeds [???] chief of the [???] [???]
which only the lord of the mark may ride . for the sire of their race was the
great horse of [???] that knew the speech of men . seven nights ago [???]
returned ; but the king ' s anger is not less [???] for now the horse is wild and
will let no man handle him . '

' then [???] has found his way alone from the far north [???] ' said
[???] ; ' for it was there that he and [???] parted . but alas ! [???]
will ride no longer . he fell into darkness in the mines of moria and comes
not again . '
' that is heavy tidings [???] ' said jomer . ' at least to me [???] and to many ;
though not to all [???] as you may find [???] if you come to the king . '
' it is tidings more grievous than any in this land can understand [???]
though it may touch them sorely ere the year is much older [???] ' said [???] .
' but when the great fall [???] the less must lead . my part it has been to guide
our company on the long road from moria . through [???] we came - - of
which
it were well that you should learn the truth ere you speak of it again - -
and thence down the leagues of the great river to the falls of [???] . there
[???] was slain by the same [???] whom you destroyed . '
' your news is all of woe ! ' cried jomer in dismay . ' great harm is this
death to minas [???] [???] and to us all . that was a worthy man ! all spoke his
praise . he came seldom to the mark [???] for he was ever in the wars on the
east - borders ; but i have seen him . more like to the swift sons of [???] than
to the grave men of [???] he seemed to me [???] and likely to prove a great
captain of his people when his time came . but we have had no word of this
grief out of [???] . when did he fall ? '
' it is now the fourth day since he was slain [???] ' answered [???] [???] ' and
since the evening of that day we have journeyed from the shadow of tol
brandir . '
' on foot ? ' cried jomer .
' yes [???] even as you see us . '
wide wonder came into jomer ' s eyes . ' strider is too poor a name [???] son of
[???] [???] ' he said . ' wingfoot i name you . this deed of the three friends
should be sung in many a hall . forty leagues and five you have measured ere
the fourth day is ended ! hardy is the race of [???] !
' but now [???] lord [???] what would you have me do ! i must return in haste to
[???] . i spoke warily before my men . it is true that we are not yet at
open war with the black land [???] and there are some [???] close to the king ' s ear [???]
that speak craven counsels ; but war is coming . we shall not forsake our old
alliance with [???] [???] and while they fight we shall aid them : so say i and
all who hold with me . the east - mark is my charge . the ward of the third
marshal [???] and i have removed all our herds and herdfolk [???] withdrawing them

beyond [???] [???] and leaving none here but guards and swift scouts . '
' then you do not pay tribute to [???] ? ' said [???] .
' we do not and we never have . ' said jomer with a flash of his eyes ;
' though it comes to my ears that that lie has been told . some years ago the
lord of the black land wished to purchase horses of us at great price [???] but
we refused him . for he puts beasts to evil use . then he sent [???]
[???] [???] and they carry off what they can [???] choosing always the black horses :
few of these are now left . for that reason our feud with the [???] is bitter .
' but at this time our chief concern is with [???] . he has claimed
lordship over all this land [???] and there has been war between us for many
months . he has taken [???] into his service [???] and wolf - riders [???] and evil men [???]
and he has closed the gap against us [???] so that we are likely to be beset both
east and west .
' it is ill dealing with such a foe : he is a [???] both cunning and
[???] - crafty [???] having many guises . he walks here and there [???] they say [???] as an
old man hooded and cloaked [???] very like to [???] [???] as many now recall . his
spies slip through every net [???] and his birds of ill omen are abroad in the
sky . i do not know how it will all end [???] and my heart [???] me ; for it
seems to me that his friends do not all dwell in [???] . but if you come
to the king ' s house [???] you shall see for yourself . will you not come ? do i
hope in vain that you have been sent to me for a help in doubt and need ? '
' i will come when i may [???] ' said [???] .
' come now ! ' said jomer . ' the heir of [???] would be a strength indeed
to the sons of [???] in this evil tide . there is battle even now upon the
[???] [???] and i fear that it may go ill for us .
' indeed in this riding north i went without the king ' s leave [???] for in my
absence his house is left with little guard . but scouts warned me of the
orc - host coming down out of the east wall three nights ago [???] and among them
they reported that some bore the white badges of [???] . so suspecting what
i most fear [???] a league between orthanc and the dark tower [???] i led forth my
jored [???] men of my own household ; and we overtook the [???] at nightfall two
days ago [???] near to the borders of the [???] . there we surrounded them [???] and
gave battle yesterday at dawn . fifteen of my men i lost [???] and twelve horses
alas ! for the [???] were greater in number than we counted on . others joined
them . coming out of the east across the great river : their trail is plain to
see a little north of this spot . and others [???] too [???] came out of the forest .
great [???] [???] who also bore the white hand of [???] : that kind is stronger

and more fell than all others .
' nonetheless we put an end to them . but we have been too long away . we
are needed south and west . will you not come ? there are spare horses as you
see . there is work for the sword to do . yes [???] and we could find a use for
[???] ' s axe and the bow of legolas [???] if they will pardon my rash words
concerning the lady of the wood . i spoke only as do all men in my land [???] and
i would gladly learn better . '
' i thank you for your fair words [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and my heart desires
to come with you ; but i cannot desert my friends while hope remains . '
' hope does not remain [???] ' said jomer . ' you will not find your friends on
the north - borders . '
' yet my friends are not behind . we found a clear token not far from the
east wall that one at least of them was still alive there . but between the
wall and the downs we have found no other trace of them [???] and no trail has
turned aside [???] this way or that [???] unless my skill has wholly left me . '
' then what do you think has become of them ? '
' i do not know . they may have been slain and burned among the [???] ; but
that you will say cannot be [???] and i do not fear it . i can only think that
they were carried off into the forest before the battle [???] even before you
[???] your foes [???] maybe . can you swear that none escaped your net in such
a way ? '
' i would swear that no orc escaped after we sighted them [???] ' said jomer .
' we reached the forest - eaves before them [???] and if after that any living thing
broke through our ring [???] then it was no orc and had some elvish power . '
' our friends were attired even as we are [???] ' said [???] ; ' and you
passed us by under the full light of day . '
' i had forgotten that [???] ' said jomer . ' it is hard to be sure of anything
among so many marvels . the world is all grown strange . elf and dwarf in
company walk in our daily fields ; and folk speak with the lady of the wood
and yet live ; and the sword comes back to war that was broken in the long
ages ere the fathers of our fathers rode into the mark ! how shall a man
judge what to do in such times ? '
' as he ever has judged [???] ' said [???] . ' good and ill have not changed
since [???] ; nor are they one thing among elves and [???] [???] and
another among men . it is a man ' s part to discern them [???] as much in the golden
wood as in his own house . '
' true indeed [???] ' said jomer . ' but i do not doubt you [???] nor the deed which

my heart would do . yet i am not free to do all as i would . it is against our
law to let strangers wander at will in our land [???] until the king himself
shall give them leave [???] and more strict is the command in these days of
peril . i have begged you to come back willingly with me [???] and you will not .
loth am i to begin a battle of one hundred against three . '
' i do not think your law was made for such a chance [???] ' said [???] .
' nor indeed am i a stranger ; for i have been in this land before [???] more than
once [???] and ridden with the host of the [???] [???] though under other name and
in other guise . you i have not seen before [???] for you are young [???] but i have
spoken with jomund your father [???] and with [???] son of [???] . never in
former days would any high lord of this land have constrained a man to
abandon such a quest as mine . my duty at least is clear [???] to go on . come now [???]
son of jomund [???] the choice must be made at last . aid us [???] or at the worst let
us go free . or seek to carry out your law . if you do so there will be fewer
to return to your war or to your king . '
jomer was silent for a moment [???] then he spoke . ' we both have need of
haste [???] ' he said . ' my company chafes to be away [???] and every hour lessens your
hope . this is my choice . you may go ; and what is more [???] i will lend you
horses . this only i ask : when your quest is achieved [???] or is proved vain [???]
return with the horses over the [???] to [???] [???] the high house in
[???] where [???] now sits . thus you shall prove to him that i have not
[???] . in this i place myself [???] and maybe my very life [???] in the keeping of
your good faith . do not fail . '
' i will not [???] ' said [???] .
there was great wonder [???] and many dark and doubtful glances [???] among his
men [???] when jomer gave orders that the spare horses were to be lent to the
strangers ; but only [???] dared to speak openly .
' it may be well enough for this lord of the race of [???] [???] as he
claims [???] ' he said [???] ' but who has heard of a horse of the mark being given to a
dwarf ? '
' no one [???] ' said [???] . ' and do not trouble : no one will ever hear of it .
i would sooner walk than si t on the back of any beast so great [???] free or
[???] . '
' but you must ride now [???] or you will hinder us [???] ' said [???] .
' come [???] you shall sit behind me [???] friend [???] [???] said legolas . then all
will be well [???] and you need neither borrow a horse nor be troubled by one . '
a great dark - grey horse was brought to [???] [???] and he mounted it .

' [???] is his name [???] ' said jomer . ' may he bear you well and to better
fortune than [???] [???] his late master ! '
a smaller and lighter horse [???] but restive and fiery [???] was brought to
legolas . arod was his name . but legolas asked them to take off saddle and
rein . ' i need them not [???] ' he said [???] and leaped lightly up [???] and to their wonder
arod was tame and willing beneath him [???] moving here and there with but a
spoken word : such was the elvish way with all good beasts . [???] was lifted
up behind his friend . and he clung to him [???] not much more at ease than sam
[???] in a boat .
' farewell [???] and may you find what you seek ! ' cried jomer . ' return with
what speed you may [???] and let our swords hereafter shine together ! '
' i will come [???] ' said [???] .
' and i will come [???] too [???] ' said [???] . ' the matter of the lady [???]
lies still between us . i have yet to teach you gentle speech . '
' we shall see [???] ' said jomer . ' so many strange things have chanced that
to learn the praise of a fair lady under the loving strokes of a dwarf ' s axe
will seem no great wonder . farewell ! '
with that they parted . very swift were the horses of [???] . when aft er
a little [???] looked back [???] the company of jomer were already small and far
away . [???] did not look back : he was watching the trail as they sped on
their way [???] bending low with his head beside the neck of [???] . before long
they came to the borders of the [???] [???] and there they met the other trail
of which jomer had spoken [???] coming down from the east out of the wold .
[???] [???] and surveyed the ground [???] then leaping back into the
saddle [???] he rode away for some distance eastward [???] keeping to one side and
taking care not to [???] the [???] . then he again [???] and
examined the ground [???] going backwards and forwards on foot .
' there is little to discover [???] ' he said when he returned . ' the main
trail is all confused with the passage of the horsemen as they came back ;
their outward course must have lain nearer the river . but this eastward
trail is fresh and clear . there is no sign there of any feet going the other
way [???] back towards [???] . now we must ride slower [???] and make sure that no
trace or footstep branches off on either side . the [???] must have been aware
from this point that they were pursued ; they may have made some attempt to
get their captives away before they were overtaken . '
as they rode forward the day was overcast . low grey clouds came over
the wold . a mist shrouded the sun . ever nearer the tree - clad [???] of

fangorn loomed [???] slowly darkling as the sun went west . they saw no sign of
any trail to right or left [???] but here a nd there they passed single [???] [???]
fallen in their tracks as they ran [???] with grey - feathered arrows sticking in
back or throat .
at last as the afternoon was waning they came to the eaves of the
forest [???] and in an open glade among the first trees they found the place of
the great burning : the ashes were still hot and smoking . beside it was a
great pile of helms and mail [???] cloven shields [???] and broken swords [???] bows and
darts and other gear of war . upon a stake in the middle was set a great
[???] head ; upon its [???] helm the white badge could still be seen .
further away [???] not far from the river [???] where it came streaming out from the
edge of the wood [???] there was a mound . it was newly raised : the raw earth was
covered with fresh - cut turves : about it were planted fifteen spears .
[???] and his companions searched far and wide about the field of
battle [???] but the light faded [???] and evening soon drew down [???] dim and misty . by
nightfall they had discovered no trace of merry and [???] .
' we can do no more [???] ' said [???] sadly . ' we have been set many [???]
since we came to tol brandir [???] but this is the hardest to [???] . i would
guess that the burned bones of the [???] are now mingled with the [???] ' .
it will be hard news for [???] [???] if he lives to hear it ; and hard too for the
old hobbit who waits in [???] . [???] was against their coming . '
' but [???] was not [???] ' said legolas .
' but [???] chose to come himself [???] and he was the first to be lost '
answered [???] . ' his foresight failed him . '
' the counsel of [???] was not founded on [???] of safety [???] for
himself or for others [???] ' said [???] . ' there are some things that it is
better to begin than to refuse [???] even though the end may be dark . but i shall
not depart from this place yet . in any case we must here [???] the
morning - light . '
a little way beyond the battle - field they made their camp under a
spreading tree : it looked like a chestnut [???] and yet it still bore many broad
brown leaves of a former year [???] like dry hands with long [???] fingers ;
they rattled mournfully in the night - breeze .
[???] shivered . they had brought only one blanket apiece . ' let us light
a fire [???] ' he said . ' i care no longer for the danger . let the [???] come as
thick as summer - moths round a candle ! '
' if those unhappy [???] are [???] in the woods [???] it might draw them

hither [???] ' said legolas .
' and it might draw other things [???] neither orc nor hobbit [???] ' said [???] .
' we are near to the mountain - marches of the traitor [???] . also we are on
the very edge of fangorn [???] and it is perilous to touch the trees of that
wood [???] it is said . '
' but the [???] made a great burning here yesterday [???] ' said [???] [???]
' and they felled trees for the fire [???] as can be seen . yet they passed the
night after safely here [???] when their labour was ended . '
' they were many [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and they do not heed the wrath of
fangorn [???] for they come here seldom [???] and they do not go under the trees . but
our paths are likely to lead us into the very forest itself . so have a care !
cut no living wood ! '
' there is no need [???] ' said [???] . ' the riders have left chip and bough
enough [???] and there is dead wood lying in plenty . ' he went off to gather fuel [???]
and busied himself with building and kindling a fire ; but [???] sat silent
with his back to the great tree [???] deep in thought ; and legolas stood alone in
the open [???] looking towards the profound shadow of the wood [???] leaning forward [???]
as one who listens to voices calling from a distance .
when the dwarf had a small bright blaze going [???] the three companions
drew close to it and sat together [???] shrouding the light with their hooded
forms . legolas looked up at the boughs of the tree reaching out above them .
' look ! ' he said . ' the tree is glad of the fire ! '
it may have been that the dancing shadows tricked their eyes [???] but
certainly to each of the companions the boughs appeared to be bending this
way and that so as to come above the flames [???] wh ile the upper branches were
stooping down ; the brown leaves now stood out stiff [???] and rubbed together
like many cold cracked hands taking comfort in the warmth .
there was a silence [???] for suddenly the dark and unknown forest [???] so near
at hand [???] made itself felt as a great brooding presence [???] full of secret
purpose . after a while legolas spoke again .
' [???] warned us not to go far into fangorn [???] ' he said . ' do you know
why [???] [???] ? what are the fables of the forest that [???] had heard ? '
' i have heard many tales in [???] and elsewhere [???] ' said [???] [???] ' but
if it were not for the words of [???] i should deem them only fables that
men have made as true knowledge fades . i had thought of asking you what
was
the truth of the matter . and if an elf of the wood does not know [???] how shall

a man answer ? '
' you have journeyed further than i [???] ' said legolas . ' i have heard
nothing of this in my own land [???] save only songs that tell how the [???] [???]
that men call ents [???] dwelt there long ago ; for fangorn is old [???] old even as
the elves would reckon it . '
' yes [???] it is old [???] ' said [???] [???] ' as old as the forest by the
barrow - downs [???] and it is far greater . [???] says that the two are akin [???] the
last [???] of the mighty woods of the elder days [???] in which the
firstborn roamed while men still slept . yet fangorn holds some secret of its
own . what it is i do not know . '
' and i do not wish to know [???] ' said [???] . ' let nothing that dwells in
fangorn be troubled on my account ! '
they now drew lots for the watches [???] and the lot for the first watch
fell to [???] . the others lay down . almost at once sleep laid hold on them .
' [???] ! ' said [???] drowsily . ' remember [???] it is perilous to cut bough or
twig from a living tree in fangorn . but do not stray far in search of dead
wood . let the fire die rather ! call me at need ! '
with that he fell asleep . legolas already lay motionless [???] his fair
hands folded upon his breast [???] his eyes [???] [???] [???] living night and
deep dream [???] as is the way with elves . [???] sat hunched by the fire [???] running
his thumb thoughtfully along the edge of his axe . the tree rustled . there
was no other sound .
suddenly [???] looked up [???] and there just on the edge of the fire - light
stood an old bent man [???] leaning on a staff [???] and wrapped in a great cloak ; his
wide - brimmed hat was pulled down over his eyes . [???] sprang up [???] too
amazed
for the moment to cry out [???] though at once the thought flashed into his mind
that [???] had caught them . both [???] and legolas [???] roused by his
sudden
movement [???] sat up and stared . the old man did not speak or make [???] sign .
' well [???] father [???] what can we do for you ? ' said [???] [???] leaping to his
feet . ' come and be warm [???] if you are cold ! ' he strode forward [???] but the old
man was gone . there was no trace of him to be found near at hand [???] and they
did not dare to wander far . the moon had set and the night was very dark .
suddenly legolas gave a cry . ' the horses ! the horses ! '
the horses wer e gone . they had dragged their pickets and disappeared .
for me time the three companions stood still and silent [???] troubled by this

new stroke of ill fortune . they were under the eaves of fangorn [???] and endless
leagues lay between them and the men of [???] [???] their only friends in this
wide and dangerous land . as they stood [???] it seemed to them that they heard [???]
far off in the night . the sound of horses [???] and neighing . then all
was quiet again [???] except for the cold rustle of the wind .
' well [???] they are gone [???] ' said [???] at last . ' we cannot find them or
catch them ; so that if they do not return of their own will [???] we must do
without . we started on our feet [???] and we have those still . '
' feet ! ' said [???] . ' but we cannot eat them as well as walk on them '
he threw some fuel on the fire and [???] down beside it .
' only a few hours ago you were unwilling to sit on a horse of [???] [???] '
laughed legolas . ' you will make a rider yet . '
' it seems unlikely that i shall have the chance [???] ' said [???] .
' if you wish to know what i think [???] ' he began again after a while ' i
think it was [???] . who else ? remember the words of jomer : he walks
about
like an old man hooded and cloaked . those were the words . he has gone off
with our horses [???] or scared them away [???] and here we are . there is more trouble
coming to us [???] mark my words ! '
' i mark them [???] ' said [???] . ' but i marked also that this old man had a
hat not a hood . still i do not doubt that you guess right [???] and that we are
in peril here [???] by night or day . yet in the meantime there is nothing that we
can do but rest [???] while we may . i will watch for a while now [???] [???] . i have
more need of thought than of sleep . '
the night passed slowly . legolas followed [???] [???] and [???] followed
legolas [???] and their watches wore away . but nothing happened . the old man did
not appear again [???] and the horses did not return .




chapter 3 . the [???] - hai



[???] lay in a dark and troubled dream : it seemed that he could hear
his own small vo ice echoing in black [???] [???] calling [???] [???] [???] ! but
instead of [???] hundreds of hideous orc - faces grinned at him out of the
shadows [???] hundreds of hideous arms grasped at him from every side . where
was
merry ?
he woke . cold air blew on his face . he was lying on his back . evening
was coming and the sky above was growing dim . he turned and found that the
dream was little worse than the waking . his wrists [???] legs [???] and ankles were
tied with cords . beside him merry lay [???] white - faced [???] with a dirty rag bound
across his brows . all about them sat or stood a great company of [???] .
slowly in [???] ' s aching head memory pieced itself together and became
separated from dream - shadows . of course : he and merry had run off into the
woods . what had come over them ? why had they dashed off like that [???] taking
no
notice of old strider ? they had run a long way shouting - - he could not
remember how far or how long ; and then suddenly they had [???] right into
a group of [???] : they were standing listening [???] and they did not appear to
see merry and [???] until they were almost in their arms . then they yelled
and dozens of other [???] had sprung out of the trees . merry and he had
drawn their swords [???] but the [???] did not wish to fight [???] and had tried only
to lay hold of them [???] even when merry had cut off several of their arms and
hands . good old merry !
then [???] had come leaping through the trees . he had made them
fight . he slew many of them and the rest fled . but they had not gone far on
the way back when they were attacked again . by a hundred [???] at least [???] some
of them very large [???] and they shot a rain of arrows : always at [???] .
[???] had blown his great horn till the woods rang [???] and at first the [???]
had been dismayed and had drawn back ; but when no answer but the echoes
came [???] they had attacked more fierce than ever . [???] did not remember much
more . his last memo was of [???] leaning against a tree [???] plucking out an
arrow ; then darkness fell suddenly .
' i suppose i was knocked on the head [???] ' he said to himself . ' i wonder if

poor merry is much hurt . what has happened to [???] ? why didn ' t the
[???]
kill us ? where are we [???] and where are we going ? '
he could not answer the questions . he felt cold and sick . ' i wish
[???] had never persuaded [???] to let us come [???] ' he thought . ' what good
have i been ? just a [???] : a passenger [???] a piece of [???] . and now i
have been stolen and i am just a piece of [???] for the [???] . i hope
strider or someone will come and claim us ! but ought i to hope for it ? won ' t
that throw out all the plans ? i wish i could get free ! '
he struggled a little [???] quite uselessly . one of the [???] sitting near
laughed and said something to a companion in their abominable tongue . ' rest
while you can [???] little fool ! ' he said then to [???] [???] in the common speech [???]
which he made almost as hideous as his own language . ' rest while you can !
we ' ll find a use for your legs before long . you ' ll wish you had got none
before we get home . '
' if i had my way [???] you ' d wish you were dead now [???] ' said the other . ' i ' d
make you squeak [???] you miserable rat . ' he stooped over [???] bringing his
yellow fangs close to his face . he had a black knife with a long jagged
blade in his hand . ' lie quiet [???] or i ' ll tickle you with this [???] ' he [???] .
' don ' t draw attention to yourself [???] or i may forget my orders . curse the
[???] ! ugl [???] k u [???] sha [???] [???] - glob b [???] [???] [???] ' :
he
passed into a long angry speech in his own tongue that slowly died away into
muttering and [???] .
terrified [???] lay still [???] though the pain at his wrists and ankles
was growing [???] and the stones beneath him were boring into his back . to take
his mind off himself he listened intently to all that he could hear . there
were many voices round about [???] and though orc - speech sounded at all times
full of hate and anger [???] it seemed plain that something like a quarrel had
begun [???] and was getting hotter .
to [???] ' s surpr ise he found that much of the talk was intelligible
many of the [???] were using ordinary language . apparently the members of
two
or three quite different tribes were present [???] and they could not understand
one another ' s orc - speech . there was an angry debate concerning what they
were to do now : which way they were to take and what should be done with the
prisoners .

' there ' s no time to kill them properly [???] ' said one . ' no time for play on
this trip . '
' that can ' t be helped [???] ' said another . ' but why not kill them quick [???]
kill them now ? they ' re a cursed [???] [???] and we ' re in a hurry . evening ' s
coming on [???] and we ought to get a move on . '
' orders . ' said a third voice in a deep growl . ' kill all but not the
halfings ; they are to be brought back alive as quickly as possible . that ' s
my orders . '
' what are they wanted for ? ' asked several voices . ' why alive ? do they
give good sport ? '
' no ! i heard that one of them has got something [???] something that ' s
wanted for the war [???] some elvish plot or other . anyway they ' ll both be
questioned . '
' is that all you know ? why don ' t we search them and find out ? we might
find something that we could use ourselves . '
' that is a very interesting remark [???] ' sneered a voice [???] softer than the
others but more evil . ' i may have to report that . the prisoners are not to
be searched or [???] : those are my orders . '
' and mine too [???] ' said the deep voice . ' alive and as captured ; no
spoiling . that ' s my orders . '
' not our order s ! ' said one of the earlier voices . ' we have come all the
way from the mines to kill [???] and avenge our folk . i wish to kill [???] and then go
back north . '
' then you can wish again [???] ' said the growling voice . ' i am ugl [???] k . i
command . i return to [???] by the shortest road . '
' is [???] the master or the great eye ? ' said the evil voice . ' we
should go back at once to [???] [???] rz . '
' if we could cross the great river [???] we might [???] ' said another voice . ' but
there are not enough of us to venture down to the bridges . '
' i came across [???] ' said the evil voice . ' a winged [???] [???] us
northward on the east - bank . '
' maybe [???] maybe ! then you ' ll fly off with our prisoners [???] and get all the
pay and praise in [???] [???] rz [???] and leave us to foot it as best we can through
the horse - country . no [???] we must stick together . these lands are dangerous :
full of foul rebels and [???] . '
' aye [???] we must stick together [???] ' growled ugl [???] k . ' i don ' t trust you little
swine . you ' ve no guts outside your own sties . but for us you ' d all have run

away . we are the fighting [???] - hai ! we slew the great warrior . we took the
prisoners . we are the servants of [???] the wise [???] the white hand : the hand
that gives us man ' s - flesh to eat . we came out of [???] [???] and led you here [???]
and we shall lead you back by the way we choose . i am ugl [???] k . i have spoken . '
' you have spoken more than enough [???] ugl [???] k [???] ' sneered the evil voice . ' i
wonder how they would like it in [???] [???] rz . they might think that ugl [???] k ' s
shoulders needed relieving of a [???] head . they might ask where his
strange ideas came from . did they come from [???] [???] perhaps ? who does
he
think he is [???] setting up on his own with his filthy white badges ? they might
agree with me [???] with [???] their trusted messenger ; and i [???] say
this : [???] is a fool . and a dirty treacherous fool . but the great eye is
on him .
' swine is it ? how do you folk like being called swine by the
muck - rakers of a dirty little [???] ? it ' s orc - flesh they eat [???] i ' ll
warrant . '
many loud yells in orc - speech answered him [???] and the ringing clash of
weapons being drawn . [???] [???] rolled over [???] hoping to see what would
happen . his guards had gone to join in the fray . in the [???] he saw a
large black orc [???] probably ugl [???] k [???] standing facing [???] [???] a short
crook - legged creature [???] very broad and with long arms that hung almost to the
ground . round them were many smaller [???] . [???] supposed that these
were the ones from the north . they had drawn their knives and swords [???] but
[???] to attack ugl [???] k .
ugl [???] k shouted [???] and a number of other [???] of nearly his own size ran
up . then suddenly [???] without warning [???] ugl [???] k sprang forwards [???] and with two
swift strokes swept the heads off two of his [???] . [???] stepped
aside and vanished into the shadows . the others gave way [???] and one stepped
backwards and fell over merry ' s prostrate form with a curse . yet that
probably saved his life [???] for ugl [???] k ' s followers leaped over him and cut down
another with their broad - bladed swords . it was the yellow - fanged guard . his
body fell right on top of [???] [???] still clutching its long saw - edged knife .
' put up your weapons ! ' shouted ugl [???] k . ' and let ' s have no more nonsense !
we go straight west from here [???] and down the stair . from there straight to
the downs [???] then along the river to the forest . and we march day and night .
that clear ? '
' now [???] ' thought [???] [???] ' if only it takes that ugly fellow a little

while to get his troop under control [???] i ' ve got a chance . ' a gleam of hope
had come to him . the edge of the black knife had [???] his arm [???] and then
slid down to his wrist . he felt the blood trickling on to his hand [???] but he
also felt the cold touch of steel against his skin .
the [???] were getting ready to march again [???] but some of the northerners
were still unwilling [???] and the [???] slew two more before the rest were
cowed . there was much cursing and confusion . for the moment [???] was
[???] . his legs were securely bound [???] but his arms were only tied about
the wrists [???] and his hands were in front of him . he could move them both
together [???] though the bonds were cruelly tight . he pushed the dead orc to one
side [???] then hardly daring to breathe [???] he drew the knot of the wrist - cord up
and down against the blade of the knife . it was sharp and the dead hand held
it fast . the cord was cut ! quickly [???] took it in his fingers and knotted
it again into a loose bracelet of two loops and slipped it over his hands .
then he lay very still .
' pick up those prisoners ! ' shouted ugl [???] k . ' don ' t play any tricks with
them ! if they are not alive when we get back [???] someone else will die too . '
an orc seized [???] like a sack . put its head between his tied hands [???]
[???] his arms and dragged them down [???] until [???] ' s face was crushed
against its neck ; then it [???] off with him . another treated merry in the
same way . the orc ' s [???] hand gripped [???] ' s arms like iron ; the nails
bit into him . he shut his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams .
suddenly he was thrown on to the stony floor again . it was early night [???]
but the slim moon was already falling westward . they were on the edge of a
cliff that seemed to look out over a sea of pale mist . there was a sound of
water falling nearby .
' the scouts have come back at last [???] ' said an orc close at hand .
' well [???] what did you discover ? ' growled the voice of ugl [???] k .
' only a single horseman [???] and he made off westwards . all ' s clear now . '
' now [???] i daresay . but how long ? you fools ! you should have shot him .
he ' ll raise the alarm . the cursed [???] will hear of us by morning .
now we ' ll have to leg it double quick . '
a shadow bent over [???] . it was ugl [???] k . ' sit up ! ' said the orc . ' my
lads are tired of lugging you about . we have got to climb down and you must
use your legs . be helpful now . no crying out [???] no trying to escape . we have
ways of paying for tricks that you won ' t like [???] though they won ' t spoil your
usefulness for the master . '

he cut the [???] round [???] ' s legs and ankles [???] picked him up by his
hair and stood him on his feet . [???] fell down [???] and ugl [???] k dragged him up
by his hair again . several [???] laughed . ugl [???] k thrust a flask between his
teeth and poured some burning liquid down his throat : he felt a hot fierce
glow flow through him . the pain in his legs and ankles vanished . he could
stand .
' now for the other ! ' said ugl [???] k . [???] saw him go to merry [???] who was
lying close by [???] and kick him . merry groaned . seizing him roughly ugl [???] k
pulled him into a sitting position [???] and tore the bandage off his head . then
he smeared the wound with some dark stuff out of a small wooden box . merry
cried out and struggled wildly .
the [???] clapped and hooted . ' can ' t take his medicine [???] ' they jeered .
' doesn ' t know what ' s good for him . ai ! we shall have some fun later . '
but at the moment ugl [???] k was not engaged in sport . he needed speed and
had to humour unwilling followers . he was healing merry in orc - fashion ; and
his treatment worked swiftly . when he had forced a drink from his flask down
the hobbit ' s throat [???] cut his leg - bonds [???] and dragged him to his feet [???] merry
stood up [???] looking pale but grim and defiant [???] and very much alive . the gash
in his forehead gave him no more trouble [???] but he bore a brown scar to the
end of his days .
' hullo [???] [???] ! ' he said . ' so you ' ve come on this little expedition [???]
too ? where do we get bed and breakfast ? '
' now then ! ' said ugl [???] k . ' none of that ! hold your tongues . no talk to
one another . any trouble will be reported at the other end [???] and he ' ll know
how to pay you . you ' ll get bed and breakfast all right : more than you can
stomach . '
the orc - band began to descend a narrow ravine leading down into the
misty plain below . merry and [???] [???] separated by a dozen [???] or more [???]
climbed down with them . at the bottom they stepped on to grass [???] and the
hearts of the [???] rose .
' now straight on ! ' shouted ugl [???] k . ' west and a little north . follow
[???] . '
' but what are we going to do at [???] ? ' said some of the northerners .
' go on running [???] ' said ugl [???] k . ' what do you think ? sit on the grass and
wait for the [???] to join the [???] ? '
' but we can ' t run in the sunlight . '
' you ' ll run with me behind you [???] ' said ugl [???] k . ' run ! or you ' ll never see

your beloved holes again . by the white hand ! what ' s the use of sending out
mountain - [???] on a trip [???] only half trained . run [???] curse you ! run while
night lasts ! '
then the whole company began to run with the long loping strides of
[???] . they kept no order [???] thrusting [???] [???] [???] and cursing ; yet their speed
was very great . each hobbit had a guard of three . [???] was far back in the
line . he wondered how long he would be able to go on at this pace : he had
had no food since the morning . one of his guards had a whip . but at present
the orc - liquor was still hot in him . his wits [???] too [???] were wide - awake .
every now and again there came into his mind [???] a vision of the
keen face of strider bending over a dark trail [???] and running [???] running behind .
but what could even a ranger see except a confused trail of orc - feet ? his
own little prints and merry ' s were overwhelmed by the trampling of the
iron - shod shoes before them and behind them and about them .
they had gone only a mile or so from the cliff when the land [???]
down into a wide shallow depression [???] where the ground was soft and wet . mist
lay there [???] pale - [???] in the last rays of the sickle moon . the dark
shapes of the [???] in front grew dim [???] and then were swallowed up .
' ai ! steady now ! ' shouted ugl [???] k from the rear .
a sudden thought leaped into [???] ' s mind [???] and he acted on it at once .
he [???] aside to the right [???] and dived out of the reach of his clutching
guard [???] [???] into the mist ; he landed [???] on the grass .
' halt ! ' yelled ugl [???] k .
there was for a moment [???] and confusion . [???] sprang up and ran .
but the [???] were after him . some suddenly loomed up right in front of him .
' no hope of escape ! ' thought [???] . ' but there is a hope that i have
left some of my own marks [???] on the wet ground . ' he groped with his
two tied hands at his throat [???] and [???] the brooch of his cloak . just as
long arms and hard claws seized him . he let it fall . ' there i suppose it
will lie until the end of time [???] ' he thought . ' i don ' t know why i did it . if
the others have escaped [???] they ' ve probably all gone with [???] . '
a whip - thong curled round his legs [???] and he [???] a cry .
' enough ! ' shouted ugl [???] k running up . ' he ' s still got to run a long way
yet . make ' em both run ! just use the whip as a reminder . '
' but that ' s not all [???] ' he [???] [???] turning to [???] . ' i shan ' t forget .
payment is only put off . leg it ! '
neither [???] nor merry remembered much of the later part of the

journey . evil dreams and evil waking were blended into a long tunnel of
misery [???] with hope growing ever fainter behind . they ran [???] and they ran [???]
striving to keep up the pace set by the [???] [???] licked every now and again
with a cruel thong cunningly handled . if they halted or [???] [???] they were
seized and dragged for some distance .
the warmth of the orc - draught had gone . [???] felt cold and sick
again . suddenly he fell face downward on the turf . hard hands with rending
nails gripped and lifted him . he was carried like a sack once more [???] and
darkness grew about him : whether the darkness of another night [???] or a
blindness of his eyes [???] he could not tell .
dimly he became aware of voices clamouring : it seemed that many of the
[???] were demanding a halt . ugl [???] k was shouting . he felt himself flung to the
ground [???] and he lay as he fell [???] till black dreams took him . but he did not
long escape from pain ; soon the iron grip of merciless hands was on him
again . for a long time he was tossed and shaken [???] and then slowly the
darkness gave way [???] and he came back to the waking world and found that it
was morning . orders were shouted and he was thrown roughly on the grass .
there he lay for a while [???] fighting with despair . his head swam [???] but
from the heat in his body he guessed that he had been given another draught .
an orc stooped over him [???] and flung him some bread and a strip of raw dried
flesh . he ate the stale grey bread hungrily [???] but not the meat . he was
famished but not yet so famished as to eat flesh flung to him by an orc [???] the
flesh of he dared not guess what creature .
he sat up and looked about . merry was not far away . they were by the
banks of a swift narrow river . ahead mountains loomed : a tall peak was
catching the first rays of the sun . a dark smudge of forest lay on the lower
[???] before them .
there was much shou ting and debating among the [???] ; a quarrel seemed
on the point of breaking out again between the northerners and the
[???] . some were pointing back away south [???] and some were pointing
eastward .
' very well [???] ' said ugl [???] k . ' leave them to me then ! no killing [???] as i ' ve
told you before ; but if you want to throw away what we ' ve come all the way
to get [???] throw it away ! i ' ll look after it . let the fighting [???] - hai do the
work [???] as usual . if you ' re afraid of the [???] [???] run ! run ! there ' s the
forest [???] ' he shouted [???] pointing ahead . ' get to it ! it ' s your best hope . off
you go ! and quick [???] before i knock a few more heads off [???] to put some sense

into the others . '
there was some cursing and [???] [???] and then most of the northe rners
broke away and dashed off [???] over a hundred of them [???] running wildly along the
river towards the mountains . the [???] were left with the [???] : a
grim dark band [???] four score at least of large [???] swart [???] slant - eyed [???] with
great bows and shor t broad - bladed swords . a few of the larger and bolder
northerners remained with them .
' now we ' ll deal with [???] [???] ' said ugl [???] k ; but some even of his own
followers were looking [???] southwards .
' i know [???] ' growled ugl [???] k . ' the cursed horse - boys have got wind of us .
but that ' s all your fault [???] [???] . you and the other scouts ought to have
your ears cut off . but we are the fighters . we ' ll feast on [???] yet [???]
or something better . '
at that moment [???] saw why some of the troop had been pointing
eastward . from that direction there now came hoarse cries [???] and there was
[???] again [???] and at his back a couple of score of others like him :
long - armed crook - legged [???] . they had a red eye painted on their shields .
ugl [???] k stepped forward to meet them . ' so you ' ve come back ? ' he said . ' thought
better of it [???] eh ? '
' i ' ve returned to see that orders are carried out and the prisoners
safe [???] ' answered [???] .
' indeed ! ' said ugl [???] k . ' waste of effort . i ' ll see that orders are
carried out in my command . and what else did you come back for ? you went
in
a hurry . did you leave anything behind ? '
' i left a fool [???] ' [???] [???] . ' but there were some stout fellows
with him that are too good to lose . i knew you ' d lead them into a mess . i ' ve
come to help them . '
' [???] ! ' laughed ugl [???] k . ' but unless you ' ve got some guts for
fighting [???] you ' ve taken the wrong way . [???] [???] rz was your road . the
[???]
are coming . what ' s happened to your precious [???] ? has he had another
mount shot under him ? now [???] if you ' d brought him along [???] that might have been
useful - if these [???] are all they make out . '
' [???] [???] [???] [???] ' said [???] [???] shivering and licking his lips [???] as if
the word had a foul taste that he savoured painfully . ' you speak of what is
deep beyond the reach of your muddy dreams [???] ugl [???] k [???] ' he said . ' [???] ! ah !

all that they make out ! one day you ' ll wish that you had not said that .
ape ! ' he [???] fiercely . ' you ought to know that they ' re the apple of the
great eye . but the winged [???] : not yet [???] not yet . he won ' t let them show
themselves across the great river yet [???] not too soon . they ' re for the war - and
other purposes . '
' you seem to know a lot [???] ' said ugl [???] k . ' more than is good for you [???] i
guess . perhaps those in [???] [???] rz might wonder how [???] and why . but in the
meantime the [???] - hai of [???] can do the dirty work [???] as usual . don ' t
stand slavering there ! get your rabble together ! the other swine are legging
it to the forest . you ' d better follow . you wouldn ' t get back to the great
river alive . right off the mark ! now ! i ' ll be on your heels . '
the [???] seized merry and [???] again and slung them on their
backs . then the troop started off . hour after hour they ran [???] [???] now and
again only to sling the [???] to fresh carriers . either because they were
quicker and hardier [???] or because of some plan of [???] ' s [???] the [???]
gradually passed through the [???] of [???] [???] and [???] ' s folk closed in
behind . soon they were gaining also on the northerners ahead . the forest
began to draw nearer .
[???] was bruised and torn [???] his aching head was grated by the filthy
[???] and hairy ear of the orc that held him . immediately in front were bowed
backs [???] and tough thick legs going up and down [???] up and down [???] [???] [???] as if
they were made of wire and horn [???] beating out the [???] seconds of an
endless time .
in the afternoon ugl [???] k ' s troop overtook the northerners . they were
flagging in the rays of the bright sun [???] winter sun shining in a pale cool
sky though it was ; their heads were down and their tongues lolling out .
' [???] ! ' jeered the [???] . ' you ' re cooked . the [???] will
catch you and eat you . they ' re coming ! '
a cry from [???] showed that this was not mere jest . horsemen [???]
riding very swiftly [???] had indeed been sighted : still far behind [???] but gaining
on the [???] [???] gaining on them like a tide over the flats on folk straying in
a quicksand .
the [???] began to run with a [???] pace that astonished
[???] [???] a terrific spurt it seemed for the end of a race . then he saw that
the sun was sinking [???] falling behind the misty mountains ; shadows reached
over the land . the soldiers of [???] lifted their heads and also began to
put on speed . the forest was dark and close . already they had passed a few

[???] trees . the land was beginning to slope upwards . ever more steeply ;
but the [???] did not halt . both ugl [???] k and [???] shouted [???] spurring them
on to a last effort .
' they will make it yet . they will escape [???] ' thought [???] . and then he
managed to twist his neck . so as to glance back with one eye over his
shoulder . he saw that riders away eastward were already level with the [???] [???]
[???] over the plain . the sunset gilded their spears and helmets [???] and
glinted in their pale flowing hair . they were hemming the [???] in [???]
preventing them from scattering [???] and driving them along the line of the
river .
he wondered very much what kind of folk they were . he wished now that
he had learned more in [???] [???] and looked more at maps and things ; but in
those days the plans for the journey seemed to be in more competent hands [???]
and he had never reckoned with being cut off from [???] [???] or from strider [???]
and even from [???] . all that he could remember about [???] was that
[???] ' s horse [???] [???] [???] had come from that land . that sounded hopeful [???]
as far as it went .
' but how will they know that we are not [???] ? ' he thought . ' i don ' t
suppose they ' ve ever heard of [???] down here . i suppose i ought to be
glad that the beastly [???] look like being destroyed [???] but i would rather be
saved myself . ' the chances were that he and merry wou ld be killed together
with their captors [???] before ever the men of [???] were aware of them .
a few of the riders appeared to be bowmen [???] skilled at shooting from a
running horse . riding swiftly into range they shot arrows at the [???] that
[???] behind [???] and several of them fell ; then the riders wheeled away out
of the range of the answering bows of their enemies [???] who shot wildly [???] not
daring to halt . this happened many times [???] and on one occasion arrows fell
among the [???] . one of them [???] just in front of [???] [???] [???] and
did not get up again .
night came down without the riders closing in for battle . many [???] had
fallen [???] but fully two hundred remained . in the early darkness the [???] came
to a hillock . the eaves of the forest were very near [???] probably no more than
three [???] away [???] but they could go no further . the horsemen had
[???] them . a small band [???] ugl [???] k ' s command [???] and ran on
towards
the forest : only three returned .
' well [???] here we are [???] ' sneered [???] . ' fine leadership ! i hope the

great ugl [???] k will lead us out again . '
' put those halflings down ! ' ordered ugl [???] k [???] taking no notice of
[???] . ' you [???] [???] [???] get two others and stand guard over them ! they ' re
not to be killed [???] unless the filthy [???] break through . understand ? as
long as i ' m alive [???] i want ' em . but they ' re not to cry out [???] and they ' re not
to be rescued . bind their legs ! '
the last part of the order was carried out [???] . but [???]
found that for the first time he was close to merry . the [???] were making a
great deal of noise [???] shouting and [???] their weapons [???] and the [???]
managed to whisper together for a while .
' i don ' t think much of this [???] ' said merry . ' i feel nearly done in . don ' t
think i could [???] away far [???] even if i was free . '
' [???] ! ' whispered [???] . ' [???] : i ' ve got some . have you ? i don ' t
think they ' ve taken anything but our swords . '
' yes [???] i had a packet in my pocket [???] ' answered merry [???] ' but it must be
battered to [???] . anyway i can ' t put my mouth in my pocket ! '
' you won ' t have to . i ' ve - - ' ; but just then a savage kick warned [???]
that the noise had died down [???] and the guards were watchful .
the night was cold and still . all round the knoll on which the [???]
were gathered little watch - fires sprang up [???] golden - red in the darkness [???] a
complete ring of them . they were within a long [???] . but the riders did
not show themselves against the light [???] and the [???] wasted many arrows
shooting at the fires [???] until ugl [???] k stopped them . the riders made no sound .
later in the night when the moon came out of the mist [???] then occasionally
they could be seen [???] shadowy shapes that glinted now and again in the white
light [???] as they moved in ceaseless patrol .
' they ' ll wait for the sun [???] curse them ! ' growled one of the guards . ' why
don ' t we get together and charge through ? what ' s old ugl [???] k think he ' s doing [???]
i should like to know ? '
' i daresay you would [???] ' [???] ugl [???] k stepping up from behind . ' meaning
i don ' t think at all [???] eh ? curse you ! you ' re as bad as the other rabble : the
[???] and the apes of [???] [???] rz . no good trying to charge with them . they ' d
just squeal and bolt [???] and there are more than enough of these filthy
horse - boys to mop up our lot on the flat .
' there ' s only one thing those [???] can do : they can see like [???]
in the dark . but these [???] have better night - eyes than most men [???] from
all i ' ve heard ; and don ' t forget their horses ! they can see the

night - breeze [???] or so it ' s said . still there ' s one thing the fine fellows
don ' t know : [???] [???] r and his lads are in the forest [???] and they should turn up
any time now . '
ugl [???] k ' s words were enough [???] apparently [???] to satisfy the [???] ; but
the other [???] were both [???] and rebellious . they posted a few
watchers [???] but most of them lay on the ground [???] resting in the pleasant
darkness . it did indeed become very dark again ; for the moon passed westward
into thick cloud [???] and [???] could not see anything a few feet away . the
fires brought no light to the hillock . the riders were not [???] however [???] content
merely to wait for the dawn and let their enemies rest . a sudden [???] on
the east side of the knoll showed that something was wrong . it seemed that
some of the men had ridden in close [???] slipped off their horses [???] [???] to
the edge of the camp and killed several [???] [???] and then had faded away again .
ugl [???] k dashed off to stop a [???] .
[???] and merry sat up . their guards [???] [???] [???] had gone with
ugl [???] k . but if the [???] had any thought of escape [???] it was soon dashed . a
long hairy arm took each of them by the neck and drew them close together .
dimly they were aware of [???] ' s great head and hideous face between
them ; his foul breath was on their cheeks . he began to paw them and feel
them . [???] [???] as hard cold fingers groped down his back .
' well [???] my little ones ! ' said [???] in a soft whisper . ' enjoying
your nice rest ? or not ? a little [???] placed [???] perhaps : swords and whips
on one side [???] and [???] spears on the other ! little people should not meddle
_ in affairs that are too big for them . ' his fingers continued to grope .
there was a light like a pale but hot fire behind his eyes .
the thought came suddenly into [???] ' s mind [???] as if caught direct from
the urgent thought of his enemy : ' [???] knows about the ring ! he ' s
looking for it [???] while ugl [???] k is busy : he probably wants it for himself . ' cold
fear was in [???] ' s heart [???] yet at the same time he was wondering what use
he could make of [???] ' s desire .
' i don ' t think you will find it that way [???] ' he whispered . ' it isn ' t easy
to find . '
' find it ? ' said [???] : his fingers stopped [???] and gripped
[???] ' s shoulder . ' find what ? what are you talking about [???] little one ? ' . for
a moment [???] was silent . then suddenly in the darkness he made a noise in
his throat : [???] [???] [???] . ' nothing [???] my precious [???] ' he added .
the [???] felt [???] ' s fingers twitch . ' o ho ! ' [???] the [???]

softly . ' that ' s what he means [???] is it ? o ho ! very ve - ry dangerous [???] my little
ones . '
' perhaps [???] ' said merry [???] now alert and aware of [???] ' s guess . ' perhaps ;
and not only for us . still you know your own business best . do you want it [???]
or not ? and what would you give for it ? '
' do i want it ? do i want it ? ' said [???] [???] as if puzzled ; but his
arms were trembling . ' what would i give for it ? what do you mean ? '
' we mean [???] ' said [???] [???] choosing his wor ds carefully [???] ' that it ' s no
good groping in the dark . we could save you time and trouble . but you must
untie our legs first [???] or we ' ll do nothing [???] and say nothing . '
' my dear tender little fools [???] ' [???] [???] [???] ' everything you have [???]
and everything you know [???] will be got out of you in due time : everything !
you ' ll wish there was more that you could tell to satisfy the questioner [???]
indeed you will : quite soon . we shan ' t hurry the [???] . oh dear no ! what
do you think you ' ve been kept alive for ? my dear little fellows [???] please
believe me when i say that it was not out of kindness : that ' s not even one
of ugl [???] k ' s faults . '
' i find it quite easy to believe [???] ' said merry . ' but you haven ' t got
your prey home yet . and it doesn ' t seem to be going your way [???] whatever
happens . if we come to [???] [???] it won ' t be the great [???] that
benefits : [???] will take all that he can find . if you want anything for
yourself [???] now ' s the time to do a deal . '
[???] began to lose his temper . the name of [???] seemed
specially to [???] him . time was passing and the disturbance was dying
down . ugl [???] k or the [???] might return at any minute .
' have you got it - - either of you ? ' he [???] .
' [???] [???] [???] ! ' said [???] .
' untie our legs ! ' said merry .
they felt the orc ' s arms trembling violently . ' curse you [???] you filthy
little vermin ! ' he [???] . ' untie your legs ? i ' ll untie every string in your
bodies . do you think i can ' t search you to the bones ? search you ! i ' ll cut
you both to [???] shreds . i don ' t need the help of your legs to get you
away - and have you all to myself ! '
suddenly he seized them . the strength in his long arms and shoulders
was terrifying . he tucked them one under each armpit [???] and crushed them
fiercely to his sides ; a great [???] hand was clapped over each of their
mouths . then he sprang forward [???] stooping low . quickly and silently he went [???]

until he came to the edge of the knoll . there [???] choosing a gap between the
watchers [???] he passed like an evil shadow out into the night [???] down the slope
and away westward towards the river that flowed out of the forest . in that
direction there was a wide open space with only one fire .
after going a dozen yards he halted [???] peering and listening . nothing
could be seen or heard . he crept slowly on [???] bent almost double . then he
[???] and listened again . then he stood up [???] as if to risk a sudden dash .
at that very moment the dark form of a rider loomed up right in front of
him . a horse snorted and reared . a man called out .
[???] flung himself on the ground flat [???] dragging the [???] under
him ; then he drew his sword . no doubt he meant to kill his captives [???] rather
than allow them to escape or to be rescued ; but it was his undoing . the
sword rang faintly [???] and glinted a little in the light of the fire away to
his left . an arrow came whistling out of the gloom : it was aimed with skill [???]
or guided by fate [???] and it pierced his right hand . he dr opped the sword and
shrieked . there was a quick beat of [???] [???] and even as [???] leaped up
and ran [???] he was ridden down and a spear passed through him . he gave a
hideous shivering cry and lay still .
the [???] remained flat on the ground [???] as [???] had left them .
another horseman came riding swiftly to his comrade ' s aid . whether because
of some special keenness of sight [???] or because of some other sense [???] the horse
lifted and sprang lightly over them ; but its rider did not see them [???] lying
covered in their elven - cloaks [???] too crushed for the moment [???] and too afraid to
move .
at last merry stirred and whispered softly : ' so far so good : but how
are we to avoid being spitted ? '
the answer came almost immediately . the cries of [???] had roused
the [???] . from the yells and [???] that came from the knoll the [???]
guessed that their [???] had been discovered : ugl [???] k was probably
knocking off a few more heads . then suddenly the answering cries of
orc - voices came from the right [???] outside the circle of watch - fires [???] from the
direction of the forest and the mountains . [???] [???] r had apparently arrived and
was attacking the [???] . there was the sound of [???] horses . the
riders were drawing in their ring close round the knoll [???] risking the
orc - arrows [???] so as to prevent any sortie [???] while a company rode off to deal
with the [???] . suddenly merry and [???] realized that without moving
they were now outside the circle : there was nothing between them and escape .

' now [???] ' said merry [???] ' if only we had our legs and hands free [???] we might
get away . but i can ' t touch the knots [???] and i can ' t bite them . '
' no need to try [???] ' said [???] . ' i was going to tell you : i ' ve managed
to free my hands . these loops are only left for show . you ' d better have a
bit of [???] first . '
he slipped the cords off his wrists [???] and fished out a packet . the cakes
were broken [???] but good [???] still in their leaf - [???] . the [???] each ate
two or three pieces . the taste brought back to them the memory of fair
faces [???] and laughter [???] and wholesome food in quiet days now far away . for a
while they ate thoughtfully [???] sitting in the dark [???] heedless of the cries and
sounds of battle nearby . [???] was the first to come back to the present .
' we must be off [???] ' he said . ' half a moment ! ' [???] ' s sword was lying
close at hand [???] but it was too heavy and [???] for him to use ; so he [???]
forward [???] and finding the body of the [???] he drew from its sheath a long
sharp knife . with this he quickly cut their bonds .
' now for it ! ' he said . ' when we ' ve warmed up a bit [???] perhaps we shall be
able to stand again [???] and walk . but in any case we had better start by
[???] . '
they [???] . the turf was deep and yielding [???] and that helped them : but
it seemed a long slow business . they gave the watch - fire a wide berth [???] and
wormed their way forward bit by bit [???] until they came to the edge of the
river [???] [???] away in the black shadows under its deep banks . then they
looked back .
the sounds had died away . evidently [???] [???] r and his ' lads ' had been
killed or driven off . the riders had returned to their silent [???] vigil .
it would not last very much longer . already the night was old . in the east [???]
which had remained [???] [???] the sky was beginning to grow pale .
' we must get under cover [???] ' said [???] [???] ' or we shall be seen . it will
not be any comfort to us [???] if these riders discover that we are not [???]
after we are dead . ' he got up and stamped his feet . ' those cords have cut me
like wires ; but my feet are getting warm again . i could stagger on now . what
about you [???] merry ? '
merry got up . ' yes [???] ' he said [???] ' i can manage it . [???] does put heart
into you ! a more wholesome sort of feeling [???] too [???] than the heat of that
orc - draught . i wonder what it was made of . better not to know [???] i expect .
let ' s get a drink of water to wash away the thought of it ! '
' not here [???] the banks are too steep [???] ' said [???] . ' forward now ! '

they turned and walked side by side slowly along the line of the river .
behind them the light grew in the east . as they walked they compared notes [???]
talking lightly in hobbit - fashion of the things that had happened since
their capture . no listener would have guessed from their words that they had
suffered cruelly [???] and been in dire peril [???] going without hope towards torment
and death ; or that even now [???] as they knew well [???] they had little chance of
ever finding friend or safety again .
' you seem to have been doing well [???] master took [???] ' said merry . ' you will
get almost a chapter in old [???] ' s book [???] if ever i get a chance to report
to him . good work : especially guessing that hairy villain ' s little game [???] and
playing up to him . but i wonder if anyone will ever pick up your trail and
find that brooch . i should hate to lose mine [???] but i am afraid yours is gone
for good .
' i shall have to brush up my toes [???] if i am to get level with you .
indeed cousin [???] is going in front now . this is wher e he comes in . i
don ' t suppose you have much notion where we are ; but i spent my time at
[???] rather better . we are walking west along the [???] . the butt - end
of the misty mountains is in front [???] and fangorn forest . '
even as he spoke the da rk edge of the forest loomed up straight before
them . night seemed to have taken [???] under its great trees [???] creeping away
from the coming dawn .
' lead on [???] master [???] ! ' said [???] . ' or lead back ! we have been
warned against fangorn . but one so knowing will not have forgotten that . '
' i have not [???] ' answered merry ; ' but the forest seems better to me [???] all
the same [???] than turning back into the middle of a battle . '
he led the way in under the huge branches of the trees . old beyond
guessing [???] they seemed . great trailing beards of [???] hung from them [???]
blowing and swaying in the breeze . out of the shadows the [???] peeped [???]
gazing back down the slope : little [???] figures that in the dim light
looked like elf - children in the deeps of time peering out of the wild wood
in wonder at their first dawn .
far over the great river [???] and the brown lands [???] leagues upon grey
leagues away [???] the dawn came [???] red as flame . loud rang the hunting - horns to
greet it . the rider s of [???] sprang suddenly to life . horn answered horn
again .
merry and [???] heard [???] clear in the cold air [???] the neighing of
war - horses [???] and the sudden singing of many men . the sun ' s limb was lifted [???]

an arc of fire [???] above the margin of the world . then with a great cry the
riders charged from the east ; the red light gleamed on mail and spear . the
[???] yelled and shot all the arrows that remained to them . the [???] saw
several horsemen fall ; but their line held on up the hill and over it [???] and
wheeled round and charged again . most of the [???] that were left alive
then broke and fled [???] this way and that [???] pursued one by one to the death . but
one band [???] holding together in a black wedge [???] drove forward resolutely in the
direction of the forest . straight up the slope they charged towards the
watchers . now they were drawing near [???] and it seemed certain that they would
escape : they had already hewn down three riders that barred their way .
' we have watched too long [???] ' said merry . ' there ' s ugl [???] k ! i don ' t want to
meet him again . ' the [???] turned and fled deep into the shadows of the
wood .
so it was that they did not sec the last stand [???] when ugl [???] k was
overtaken and brought to bay at the very edge of fangorn . there he was slain
at last by jomer [???] the third marshal of the mark [???] who [???] and fought
him sword to sword . and over the wide fields the keen - eyed riders hunted
down the few [???] that had escaped and still had strength to fly .
then when they had laid their fallen comrades in a mound and had sung
their praises [???] the riders made a great fire and scattered the ashes of their
enemies . so ended the raid [???] and no news of it came ever back either to
[???] or to [???] ; but the smoke of the burning rose high to heaven and
was seen by many watchful eyes .


[???] h4 [???] chapter 4 . [???] [???] h4 [???] [???]



meanwhile the [???] went with as much speed as the dark and tangled
forest allowed [???] following the line of the running stream [???] westward and up
towards the [???] of the mountains [???] deeper and deeper into fangorn . slowly
their fear of the [???] died away [???] and their pace slackened . a queer [???]
feeling came over them [???] as if the air were too thin or too scanty for
breathing .
at last merry halted . ' we can ' t go on like this [???] ' he panted . ' i want
some air . '
' let ' s have a drink at any rate [???] ' said [???] . ' i ' m parched . ' he
[???] on to a great tree - root that wound down into the stream [???] and
stooping drew up some water in his cupped hands . it was clear and cold [???] and
he took many draughts . merry followed him . the water refreshed them and
seemed to cheer their hearts ; for a while they sat together on the brink of
the stream [???] [???] their sore feet and legs [???] and peering round at the
trees that stood silently about them [???] rank upon rank [???] until they faded away
into grey [???] in every direction .
' i suppose you haven ' t lost us already ? ' said [???] [???] leaning back
against a great tree - trunk . ' we can at least follow the course of this
stream [???] the [???] or whatever you call it [???] and get out again the way we
came . '
' we could [???] if our legs would do it [???] ' said merry ; ' and if we could
breathe properly . '
' yes [???] it is all very dim [???] and stuffy [???] in here [???] ' said [???] . ' it
reminds me [???] somehow [???] of the old room in the great place of the tooks away
back in the [???] at [???] : a huge place [???] where the furniture has
never been moved or changed for generations . they say the old took lived in
it year after year [???] while he and the room got older and [???]
together - and it has never changed since he died [???] a century ago . and old
[???] was my great - great - grandfather : that puts it back a bit . but that
is nothing to the old feeling of this wood . look at all those weeping [???]
trailing [???] beards and whiskers of [???] ! and most of the trees seem to be
half covered with ragged dry leaves that have never fallen . [???] . i can ' t
imagine what spring would look like here [???] if i t ever comes ; still less a
spring - cleaning . '

' but the sun at any rate must peep in sometimes . ' said merry . ' it does
not look or feel at all like [???] ' s description of [???] . that was all
dark and black [???] and the home of dark black things . this is just dim [???] and
frightfully tree - ish . you can ' t imagine animals living here at all [???] or
staying for long . '
' no [???] nor [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' and i don ' t like the thought of trying
to get through it either . nothing to cat for a hundred miles [???] i should
guess . how are our supplies ? '
' low [???] ' said merry . ' we ran off with nothing but a couple of spare
packets of [???] [???] and left everything else behind . ' they looked at what
remained of the elven - cakes : broken fragments for abou t five [???] days [???]
that was all . ' and not a wrap or a blanket [???] ' said merry . ' we shall be cold
tonight [???] whichever way we go . '
' well [???] we ' d better decide on the way now [???] ' said [???] . ' the morning
must be getting on . '
just then they became aware of a yellow light that had appeared [???] some
way further on into the wood : shafts of sunlight seemed suddenly to have
pierced the forest - roof .
' hullo ! ' said merry . ' the sun must have run into a cloud while we ' ve
been under these trees [???] and now she has run out again ; or else she has
climbed high enough to look down through some opening . it isn ' t far let ' s go
and [???] ! '
they found it was further than they thought . the ground was rising
steeply still [???] and it was becoming increasingly stony . the light grew
broader as they went on [???] and soon they saw that there was a rock - wall before
them : the side of a hill [???] or the abrupt end of some long root thrust out by
the distant mountains . no trees grew on it [???] and the sun was falling full on
its stony face . the twigs of the trees at its foot were stretched out stiff
and still [???] as if reaching out to the warmth . where all had looked so [???]
and grey before [???] the wood now gleamed with rich browns [???] and with the
smooth
black - greys of bark like polished leather . the boles of the trees glowed
with a soft green like young grass : early spring or a fleeting vision of it
was about them .
in the face of the stony wall there was something like a stair : natural
perhaps [???] and made by the weathering and splitting of the rock [???] for it was
rough and uneven . high up [???] almost level with the tops of forest - trees [???] there

was a shelf under a cliff . nothing grew there but a few grasses and weeds at
its edge [???] and one old stump of a tree with only two bent branches left : it
looked almost like the figure of some [???] old man [???] standing there [???]
blinking in the morning - light .
' up we go ! ' said merry joyfully . ' now for a breath of air [???] and a sight
of the land ! '
they climbed and [???] up the rock . if the stair had been made it
was for bigger feet and longer legs than theirs . they were too eager to be
surprised at the remarkable way in which the cuts and sores of their
captivity had healed and their vigour had returned . they came at length to
the edge of the shelf almost at the feet of the old stump ; then they sprang
up and turned round with their backs to the hill [???] breathing deep [???] and
looking out eastward . they saw that they had only come some three or four
miles into the forest : the heads of the trees marched down the [???]
towards the plain . there [???] near the fringe of the forest [???] tall spires of
curling black smoke went up [???] wavering and floating towards them .
' the wind ' s changing [???] ' said merry . ' it ' s turned east again . it feels
cool up here . '
' yes [???] ' said [???] ; ' i ' m afraid this is only a passing gleam [???] and it
will all go grey again . what a pity ! this [???] old forest looked so
different in the sunlight . i almost felt i liked the place . '
' almost felt you liked the forest ! that ' s good ! that ' s [???] kind
of you [???] ' said a strange voice . ' turn round and let me have a look at your
faces . i almost feel that i dislike you both [???] but do not let us be hasty .
turn round ! ' a large [???] - [???] hand was laid on each of their shoulders [???]
and they were twisted round [???] gently but [???] ; then two great arms
lifted them up .
they found that they were looking at a most extraordinary face . it
belonged to a large man - like [???] almost troll - like [???] figure [???] at least fourteen
foot high [???] very [???] [???] with a tall head [???] and hardly any neck . whether it
was clad in stuff like green and grey bark [???] or whether that was its hide [???]
was difficult to say . at any rate the arms [???] at a short distance from the
trunk [???] were not wrinkled [???] but covered with a brown smooth skin . the large
feet had seven toes each . the lower part of the long face was covered with a
sweeping grey beard [???] bushy [???] almost twiggy at the roots [???] thin and [???] at
the ends . but at the moment the [???] noted little but the eyes . these
deep eyes were now surveying them [???] slow and solemn [???] but very [???] .

they were brown [???] shot with a green light . often afterwards [???] tried to
describe his first impression of them .
' one felt as if there was an enormous well behind them [???] filled up with
ages of memory and long [???] slow [???] steady thinking ; but their surface was
sparkling with the present : like sun [???] on the outer leaves of a
vast tree [???] or on the ripples of a very deep lake . i don ' t know but it felt
as if something that grew in the ground - asleep [???] you might say [???] or just
feeling itself as something between roof - tip and leaf - tip [???] between deep
earth and sky had suddenly waked up [???] and was considering you with the same
slow care that it had given to its own inside affairs for endless years . '
' [???] [???] hoom [???] ' murmured the voice [???] a deep voice like a very deep
[???] instrument . ' very odd indeed ! do not be hasty [???] that is my motto .
but if i had seen you [???] before i heard your voices - i liked them : nice little
voices : they reminded me of something i cannot remember - - - if i had seen you
before i heard you [???] i should have just trodden on you [???] taking you for little
[???] [???] and found out my mistake afterwards . very odd you are [???] indeed . root
and twig [???] very odd ! '
[???] [???] though still amazed [???] no longer felt afraid . under those eyes he
felt a curious [???] [???] but not fear . ' please . ' he said [???] ' who are you ? and
what are you ? '
a queer look came into the old eyes [???] a kind of wariness ; the deep wells
were covered over . ' [???] [???] now [???] ' answered the voice ; ' well [???] i am an ent [???] or
that ' s what they call me . yes [???] ent is the word . the ent [???] i am [???] you might
say [???] in your manner of speaking . fangorn is my name according to some [???]
[???] others make it . [???] will do . '
' an ent ? ' said merry . ' what ' s that ? but what do you call yourself ?
what ' s your real name ? '
' hoo now ! ' replied [???] . ' hoo ! now that would be telling ! not so
hasty . and i am doing the asking . you are in my country . what are you [???] i
wonder ? i cannot place you . you do not seem to come in the old lists that i
learned when i was young . but that was a long [???] long time ago [???] and they may
have made new lists . let me see ! let me see ! how did it go ?
learn now the lore of living creatures !
first name the four [???] the free peoples :
eldest of all [???] the elf - children ;
dwarf the delver [???] dark are his houses ;
ent the earthborn [???] old as mountains ;

man the mortal [???] master of horses :
hm [???] hm [???] hm .
beaver the builder [???] buck the leaper [???]
bear bee - hunter [???] boar the fighter ;
hound is hungry [???] hare is fearful . . .
hm [???] hm .
eagle in eyrie [???] ox in pasture [???]
hart horn - crowned ; hawk is swiftest
swan the whitest [???] serpent coldest . . .
hoom [???] hm ; hoom . hm . how did it go ? room tum [???] room tum [???] roomty toom
tum .
it was a long list . but anyway you do not seem to fit in anywhere ! '
' we always seem to have got left out of the old lists [???] and the old
stories [???] ' said merry . ' yet we ' ve been about for quite a long time . we ' re
[???] . '
' why not make a new line ? ' said [???] .
' half - grown [???] [???] the hole - dwellers .
put us in amongst the four [???] next to man ( the big people ) and you ' ve got
it . '
' hm ! not bad [???] not bad [???] ' said [???] . ' that would do . so you live in
holes [???] eh ? it sounds very right and proper . who calls you [???] [???] though ?
that does not sound elvish to me . elves made all the old words : they began
it . '
' nobody else calls us [???] ; we call ourselves that [???] ' said [???] .
' hoom [???] hmm ! come now ! not so hasty ! you call yourselves [???] ? but
you should not go telling just anybody . you ' ll be letting out your own right
names if you ' re not careful . '
' we aren ' t careful about that [???] ' said merry . ' as a matter of fact i ' m a
[???] [???] [???] [???] [???] though most people call me just merry . '
' and i ' m a took [???] [???] took [???] but i ' m generally called [???] [???] or
even pip . '
' hm [???] but you are hasty folk [???] i see [???] ' said [???] . ' i am honoured by
your confidence ; but you should not be too free all at once . there are ents
and ents [???] you know ; or there are ents and things that look like ents but
ain ' t [???] as you might say . i ' ll call you merry and [???] if you please - nice
names . for i am not going to tell you my name [???] not yet at any rate . ' a queer
half - knowing [???] half - humorous look came with a green [???] into his eyes .

' for one thing it would take a long while : my name is growing all the time [???]
and i ' ve lived a very long [???] long time ; so my name is like a story . real
names tell you the story of the things they belong to in my language [???] in the
old entish as you might say . it is a lovely language [???] but it takes a very
long time to say anything in it [???] because we do not say anything in it .
unless it is worth taking a long time to say [???] and to listen to .
' but now [???] ' and the eyes became very bright and ' present ' [???] seeming to
grow smaller and almost sharp [???] ' what is going on ? what are you doing in it
all ? i can see and hear ( and smell and feel ) a great deal from this [???] from
this [???] from this a - [???] - [???] - [???] - [???] - lind - or - bur [???] ml . excuse me : that
is a part of my name for it ; i do not know what the word is in the outside
languages : you know [???] the thing we are on [???] where i stand and look out on fine
mornings [???] and think about the sun [???] and the grass beyond the wood [???] and the
horses [???] and the clouds [???] and the unfolding of the world . what is going on ?
what is [???] up to ? and these - - [???] [???] ' he made a deep rumbling noise
like a discord on a great organ - - ' these [???] [???] and young [???] down at
[???] ? i like news . but not too quick now . '
' there is quite a lot going on [???] ' said merry : ' and even if we tried to
be quick [???] it would take a long time to tell . but you told us not to be
hasty . ought we to tell you anything so soon ? would you think it rude [???] if we
asked what you are going to do with us [???] and which side you are on ? and did
you know [???] ? '
' yes [???] i do know him : the only [???] that really cares about trees '
said [???] . ' do you know him ? '
' yes [???] ' said [???] sadly [???] ' we did . he was a great friend [???] and he was
our guide . '
' then i can answer your other questions [???] ' said [???] . ' i am not
going to do anything with you : not if you mean by that ' do something to you '
without your leave . we might do some things together . i don ' t know about
sides . i go my own way ; but your way may go along with mine for a while . but
you speak of master [???] [???] as if he was in a story that had come to an
end . '
' yes [???] we do [???] ' said [???] sadly . ' the story seems to be going on [???] but i
am afraid [???] has fallen out of it . '
' hoo [???] come now ! ' said [???] . ' hoom [???] hm [???] ah well . ' he paused [???]
looking long at the [???] : ' hoom [???] ah [???] well i do not know what to say . come
now ! '

' if you would like to hear more . said merry [???] ' we will tell you . but it
will take some time . wouldn ' t you like to put us down ? couldn ' t we sit here
together in the sun [???] while it lasts ? you must be getting tired of holding us
up . '
' hm [???] tired ? no . i am not tired . i do not easily get tired . and i do not
sit down . i am not very . hm [???] bendable . but there . the sun is going in . let
us leave this - - did you say what you call it ? '
' hill ? ' suggested [???] . ' shelf ? step ? ' suggested merry .
[???] repeated the words thoughtfully . ' hill . yes [???] that was it . but
it is a hasty word for a thing that has stood here ever since this part of
the world was shaped . never mind . let us leave it [???] and go . '
' where shall we go ? ' asked merry .
' to my home [???] or one of my homes [???] ' answered [???] .
' is it far ? '
' i do not know . you might call it far [???] perhaps . but what does tha t
matter ? '
' well [???] you see [???] we have lost all our belongings [???] ' said merry . ' we have
only a little food . '
' o ! hm ! you need not trouble about that [???] ' said [???] . ' i can give
you a drink that will keep you green and growing for a long [???] long while . and
if we decide to part company [???] i can set you down outside my country at any
point you choose . let us go ! '
holding the [???] gently but firmly [???] one in the crook of each arm [???]
[???] lifted up first one large foot and then the other [???] and moved them
to the edge of the shelf . the rootlike toes grasped the rocks . then
carefully and solemnly [???] he stalked down from step to step [???] and reached the
floor of the forest .
at once he set off with long deliberate strides through the trees [???]
deeper and deeper into the wood [???] never far from the stream [???] climbing
steadily up towards the [???] of the mountains . many of the trees seemed
asleep [???] or as [???] of him as of any other creature that merely passed by ;
but some [???] [???] and some raised up their branches above his head as he
approached . all the while [???] as he walked [???] he talked to himself in a long
running stream of musical sounds .
the [???] were silent for some time . they felt [???] oddly enough [???] safe
and comfortable [???] and they had a great deal to think and wonder about . at
last [???] ventured to speak again .

' please [???] [???] [???] ' he said [???] ' could i ask you something ? why did
[???] warn us against your forest ? he told us not to risk getting
entangled in it . '
' hmm [???] did he now ? ' rumbled [???] . ' and i might have said much the
same [???] if you had been going the other way . do not risk getting entangled in
the woods of [???] ! that is what the elves used to call it [???] but
now they make the name shorter : [???] they call it . perhaps they are
right : maybe it is fading ; not growing . land of the valley of singing gold [???]
that was it [???] once upon a time . now it is the [???] . ah well ! but it is
a queer place [???] and not for just any one to venture in . i am surprised that
you ever got out [???] but much more surprised that you ever got in : that has not
happened to strangers for many a year . it is a queer land .
' and so is this . folk have come to grief here . aye [???] they have [???] to
grief . [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] ' he hummed to
himself . ' they are falling rather behind the world in there [???] i guess [???] ' he
said ' neither this country [???] nor anything else outside the golden wood [???] is
what it was when [???] was young . still :
[???] - [???] [???] [???] [???] 1
that is what they used to say . things have changed [???] but it is still
true in places . '
' what do you mean ? ' said [???] . ' what is true ? '
' the trees and the ents [???] ' said [???] . ' i do not understand all that
goes on myself [???] so i cannot explain it to you . some of us are still true
ents [???] and lively enough in our fashion [???] but many are growing sleepy [???] going
tree - ish [???] as you might say . most of the trees are ju st trees [???] of course ; but
many are half awake . some are quite wide awake [???] and a few are [???] well [???] ah [???]
well getting entish . that is going on all the time .
' when that happens to a tree [???] you find that some have bad hearts .
nothing to do with their wood : i do not mean that . why [???] i knew some good old
willows down the [???] [???] gone long ago [???] alas ! they were quite hollow [???]
indeed they were falling all to pieces [???] but as quiet and sweet - spoken as a
young leaf . and then there are some trees in the [???] under the
mountains [???] sound as a bell [???] and bad right through . that sort of thing seems
to spread . there used to be some very dangerous parts in this country . there
are still some very black patches . '
' like the old forest away to the north [???] do you mean ? ' asked merry .
' aye [???] aye . something like [???] but much worse . i do not doubt there is some

shadow of the great darkness lying there still away north ; and bad memories
are handed down . but there are hollow dales in this land where the darkness
has never been lifted [???] and the trees are older than i am . still [???] we do what
we can . we keep off strangers and the [???] ; and we train and we teach [???]
we walk and we weed .
' we are tree - herds [???] we old ents . few enough of us are left now . sheep
get like shepherd [???] and shepherds like sheep [???] it is said ; but slowly [???] and
neither have long in the world . it is quicker and closer with trees and
ents [???] and they walk down the ages together . for ents are more like elves :
less interested in themselves than men are [???] and better at getting inside
other things . and yet again ents are more like men [???] more changeable than
elves are [???] and quicker at taking the colour of the outside [???] you might say .
or better than both : for they are steadier a nd keep their minds on things
longer . ' some of my kin look just like trees now [???] and need something great
to rouse them ; and they speak only in whispers . but some of my trees are
limb - lithe [???] and many can talk to me . elves began it [???] of course [???] waking trees
up and teaching them to speak and learning their tree - talk . they always
wished to talk to everything [???] the old elves did . but then the great darkness
came [???] and they passed away over the sea [???] or fled into far [???] [???] and hid
themselves [???] and made songs about days that would never come again . never
again . aye [???] aye [???] there was all one wood once upon a time : from here to the
mountains of lune [???] and this was just the east end .
' those were the broad days ! time was when i could walk and sing a ll day
and hear no more than the echo of my own voice in the hollow hills . the
woods were like the woods of [???] . only thicker stronger [???] younger . and
the smell of the air ! i used to spend a week just breathing . '
[???] fell silent [???] striding along [???] and yet making hardly a sound
with his great feet . then he began to hum again [???] and passed into a murmuring
chant . gradually the [???] became aware that he was chanting to them :
in the willow - meads of [???] i walked in the spring .
ah ! the sight and the smell of the spring in nan - [???] !
and i said that was good .
i wandered in summer in the elm - woods of [???] .
ah ! the light and the music in the summer by the seven rivers of [???] !
and i thought that was best .
to the beeches of [???] i came in the autumn .
ah ! the gold and the red and the sighing of leaves in the autumn in

taur - na - [???] !
it was more than my desire .
to the pine - trees upon the highland of [???] i climbed in the
winter .
ah ! the wind and the whiteness and the black branches of winter upon
orod - na - [???] !
my voice went up and sang in the sky .
and now all those lands lie under the wave .
and i walk in [???] [???] in [???] [???] in [???] .
in my own land [???] in the country of fangorn [???]
where the roots are long [???]
and the years lie thicker than the leaves
in [???] .
he ended [???] and strode on silently [???] and in all the wood [???] as far as ear
could reach [???] there was not a sound .
the day waned [???] and [???] was twined about the boles of the trees . at
last the [???] saw [???] rising dimly before them [???] a steep dark land : they had
come to the feet of the mountains [???] and to the green roots of tall [???] .
down the hillside the young [???] [???] leaping from its springs high above [???]
ran noisily from step to step to meet them . on the right of the stream there
was a long slope [???] clad with grass [???] now grey in the [???] . no trees grew
there and it was open to the sky ; stars were shining already in lakes
between shores of cloud .
[???] strode up the slope [???] hardly slackening his pace . suddenly
before them the [???] saw a wide opening . two great trees stood there [???] one
on either side [???] like living gate - posts ; bu t there was no gate save their
crossing and [???] boughs . as the old ent approached [???] the trees lifted
up their branches [???] and all their leaves [???] and rustled . for they were
[???] trees [???] and their leaves were dark and polished [???] and gleamed in the
[???] . beyond them was a wide level space [???] as though the floor of a great
hall had been cut in the side of the hill . on either hand the walls [???]
upwards [???] until they were fifty feet high or more [???] and along each wall stood
an aisle of trees that also increased in height as they marched inwards .
at the far end the rock - wall was sheer [???] but at the bottom it had been
hollowed back into a shallow bay with an arched roof : the only roof of the
hall [???] save the branches of the trees [???] which at the inner end [???]
all the ground leaving only a broad open path in the middle . a little stream

escaped from the springs above [???] and leaving the main water [???] fell tinkling
down the sheer face of the wall [???] pouring in silver drops [???] like a fine
curtain in front of the arched bay . the water was gathered again into a
stone basin in the floor between the trees [???] and thence it spilled and flowed
away beside the open path [???] out to rejoin the [???] in its journey through
the forest .
' hm ! here we are ! ' said [???] [???] breaking his long silence . ' i have
brought you about seventy thousand ent - strides [???] but what that comes to in
the measurement of your land i do not know . anyhow we are near the roots of
the last mountain . part of the name of this place might be [???] [???] if
it were turned into your language . i like it . we will stay here tonight . ' he
set them down on the grass between the [???] of the trees [???] and they
followed him towards the great arch . the [???] now noticed that as he
walked his knees hardly bent [???] but his legs opened in a great stride . he
planted his big toes ( and they were indeed big [???] and very broad ) on the
ground first [???] before any other part of his feet .
for a moment [???] stood under the rain of the falling spring [???] and
took a deep breath ; then he laughed [???] and passed inside . a great stone table
stood there [???] but no chairs . at the back of the bay it was already quite
dark . [???] lifted two great vessels and stood them on the table . they
seemed to be filled with water ; but he held his hands over them [???] and
immediately they began to glow [???] one with a golden and the other with a rich
green light ; and the [???] of the two lights lit the bay ; as if the sun
of summer was shining through a roof of young leaves . looking back [???] the
[???] saw that the trees in the court had also begun to glow [???] faintly at
first [???] but steadily quickening [???] until every leaf was edged with light : some
green [???] some gold [???] some red as copper ; while the tree - trunks looked like
pillars moulded out of [???] stone .
' well [???] well [???] now we can talk again [???] ' said [???] . ' you are thirsty i
expect . perhaps you are also tired . drink this ! ' he went to the back of the
bay [???] and then they saw that several tall stone jars stood there [???] with heavy
lids . he removed one of the lids [???] and dipped in a great ladle [???] and with it
filled three bowls [???] one very large bowl [???] and two smaller ones .
' this is an ent - house [???] ' he said [???] ' and there are no seats [???] i fear . but
you may sit on the table . ' picking up the [???] he set them on the great
stone slab [???] six feet above the ground [???] and there they sat dangling their
legs [???] and drinking in sips .

the drink was like water [???] indeed very like the taste of the draughts
they had drunk from the [???] near [???] the borders of the forest [???] and yet
there was some scent or savour in it which they could not describe : it was
faint [???] but it reminded them of the smell of a distant wood borne from afar
by a cool breeze at night . the effect of the draught began at the toes [???] and
rose steadily through every limb [???] bringing refreshment and vigour as it
coursed upwards [???] right to the tips of the hair . indeed the [???] felt that
the hair on their heads was actually standing up [???] waving and curling and
growing . as for [???] [???] he first laved his feet in the basin beyond the
arch [???] and then he drained his bowl at one draught [???] one long [???] slow draught .
the [???] thought he would never stop .
at last he set the bowl down again . ' ah - - ah [???] ' he sighed . ' hm [???] hoom [???]
now we can talk easier . you can sit on the floor [???] and i will lie down ; that
will prevent this drink from rising to my head and sending me to sleep . '
on the right side of the bay there was a great bed on low legs ; not
more than a couple of feet high [???] covered deep in dried grass and [???] .
[???] lowered himself slowly on to this ( with only the slightest sign of
bending at his middle ) [???] until he lay at full length [???] with his arms behind
his head [???] looking up at the ceiling . upon which lights were [???] [???] like
the play of leaves in the sunshine . merry and [???] sat beside him on
pillows of grass .
' now tell me your tale [???] and do not hurry ! ' said [???] .
the [???] began to tell him the story of their adventures ever since
they left [???] . they followed no very clear order [???] for they interrupted
one another continually [???] and [???] often stopped the speaker [???] and went
back to some earlier point [???] or jumped forward asking questions about later
events . they said nothing whatever about the ring [???] and did not tell him why
they set out or where they were going to ; and he did not ask for any
reasons .
he was [???] interested in everything : in the black riders [???] in
[???] [???] and [???] [???] in the old forest [???] and tom [???] [???] in the mines of
moria [???] and in [???] and [???] . he made them describe the shire and
its country over and over again . he said an odd thing at this point . ' you
never see any [???] hm [???] any ents round there do you ? ' he asked . ' well [???] not ents [???]
[???] i should really say . '
' [???] ? ' said [???] . ' are they like you at all ? '
yes [???] hm [???] well no : i do not really know now [???] said [???]

thoughtfully . ' but they would like your country [???] so i just wondered . '
[???] was however especially interested in everything that
concerned [???] ; and most interested of all in [???] ' s doings . the
[???] [???] very much that they knew so little about them : only a
rather vague report by sam of what [???] had told the council . but they
were clear at any rate that ugl [???] k and his troop came from [???] [???] and
spoke of [???] as their master .
' hm [???] hoom ! ' said [???] [???] when at last their story had wound and
wandered down to the battle of the [???] and the riders of [???] . ' well [???]
well ! that is a bundle of news and no mistake . you have not told me all [???] no
indeed [???] not by a long way . but i do not doubt that you a re doing as [???]
would wish . there is something very big going on [???] that i can see [???] and what
it is maybe i shall learn in good time [???] or in bad time . by root and twig [???]
but it is a strange business : up sprout a little folk that are not in the
old lists [???] and behold the nine forgotten riders reappear to hunt them [???] and
[???] takes them on a great journey [???] and [???] harbours them in caras
[???] [???] and [???] pursue them down all the leagues of wilderland : indeed
they seem to be caught up in a great storm . i hope they weather it ! '
' and what about yourself ? ' asked merry .
' hoom [???] hm [???] i have not troubled about the great wars [???] ' said [???] ;
' they mostly concern elves and men . that is the business of [???] : [???]
are always troubled about the future . i do not like [???] about the
future . i am not altogether on anybody ' s side [???] because nobody is altogether
on my side [???] if you understand me : nobody cares for the woods as i care for
them [???] not even elves [???] . still [???] i take more kindly to elves than to
others : it was the elves that cured us of dumbness long ago [???] and that was a
great gift that cannot be forgotten [???] though our ways have parted since . and
there are some things [???] of course [???] whose side i am altogether not on ; i am
against them altogether : these - - [???] ' ( he again made a deep rumble of
disgust ) ' - - these [???] [???] and their masters .
' i used to be anxious when the shadow lay on [???] [???] but when it
removed to [???] [???] i did not trouble for a while : [???] is a long way away .
but it seems that the wind is setting east [???] and the withering of all woods
may be drawing near . there is naught that an old ent can do to hold back
that storm : he must weather it or crack .
' but [???] now ! [???] is a neighbour : i cannot overlook him . i must
do something . i suppose . i have often wondered lately what i should do about

[???] . '
' who is [???] ? ' asked [???] . ' do you know anything about his
history ? ' ' [???] is a [???] [???] ' answered [???] . ' more than that i
cannot say . i do not know the history of [???] . they appeared first after
the great ships came over the sea ; but if they came with the ships i never
can tell . [???] was reckoned great among them . i believe . he gave up
wandering about and minding the affairs of men and elves [???] some time ago - -
you would call it a very long time ago : and he settled down at [???] [???] or
[???] as the men of [???] call it . he was very quiet to begin with [???] but
his fame began to gr ow . he was chosen to be head of the white council [???] they
say ; but that did not turn out too well . i wonder now if even then [???]
was not turning to evil ways . but at any rate he used to give no trouble to
his neighbours . i used to talk to him . there was a time when he was always
walking about my woods . he was polite in those days [???] always asking my leave
( at least when he met me ) ; and always eager to listen . i told him many
things that he would never have found out by himself ; but he never repaid me
in like kind . i cannot remember that he ever told . me anything . and he got
more and more like that ; his face [???] as i remember it - i have not seen it for
many a day - became like windows in a stone wall : windows with shutters
inside .
' i think that i now understand what he is up to . he is plotting to
become a power . he has a mind of metal and wheels ; and he does not care for
growing things [???] except as far as they serve him for the moment . and now it
is clear that he is a black traitor . he has taken up with foul folk [???] with
the [???] . brm [???] hoom ! worse than that : he has been doing something to them ;
something dangerous . for these [???] are more like wicked men . it is a
mark of evil things that came in the great darkness that they cannot abide
the sun ; but [???] ' s [???] can endure it [???] even if they hate it . i wonder
what he has done ? are they men he has ruined [???] or has he blended the races of
[???] and men ? that would be a black evil ! '
[???] rumbled for a moment [???] as if he were pronouncing some deep [???]
[???] entish [???] . ' some time ago i began to wonder how [???]
dared to pass through my woods so freely [???] ' he went on . ' only lately did i
guess that [???] was to blame [???] and that long ago he had been spying out
all the ways [???] and discovering my secrets . he and his foul folk are making
havoc now . down on the borders they are felling trees - good trees . some of
the trees they just cut down and leave to rot - - orc - mischief that ; but most

are hewn up and carried off to feed the fires of orthanc . there is always a
smoke rising from [???] these days .
' curse him [???] root and branch ! many of those trees were my friends
creatures i had known from nut and acorn ; many had voices of their own that
are lost for ever now . and there are wastes of stump and bramble where once
there were singing groves . i have been idle . i have let things slip . it must
stop ! '
[???] raised himself from his bed with a jerk [???] stood up [???] and
thumped his hand on the table . the vessels of light trembled and sent up two
jets of flame . there was a [???] like green fire in his eyes [???] and his
beard stood out stiff as a great besom .
' i will stop it ! ' he boomed . ' and you shall come with me . you may be
able to help me . you will be helping your own friends that way [???] too ; for if
[???] is not checked [???] and [???] will have an enemy behind as well
as
in front . our roads go together - - to [???] ! '
' we will come with you [???] ' said merry . ' we will do wha t we can . '
' yes ! ' said [???] . ' i should like to see the white hand overthrown . i
should like to be there [???] even if i could not be of much use : i shall never
forget ugl [???] k and the crossing of [???] . '
' good ! good ! ' said [???] . ' but i spoke hastily . we must not be
hasty . i have become too hot . i must cool myself and think ; fur it is easier
to shout stop ! than to do it . '
he strode to the archway and stood for some time under the falling rain
of the spring . then he laughed and shook himself [???] and wherever the drops of
water fell glittering from him to the ground they glinted like red and green
sparks . he came back and laid himself on the bed again and was silent .
after some time the [???] heard him murmuring again . he seemed to be
counting on his fingers . ' fangorn [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] aye [???] aye [???] ' he sighed .
' the trouble is that there are so few of us left [???] ' he said turning towards
the [???] . ' only three remain of the first ents that walked in the woods
before the darkness : only myself [???] fangorn [???] and [???] and [???] - - to
give them their elvish names ; you may call them leaflock and [???] if you
like that better . and of us three leaflock and [???] are not much use for
this business . leaflock has grown sleepy . almost tree - ish [???] you might say : he
has taken to standing by himself half - asleep all through the summer with the
deep grass of the [???] round his knees . covered with leafy hair he is . he

used to rouse up in winter ; but of late he has been too drowsy to walk far
even then . [???] lived on the mountain - [???] west of [???] . that is
where the worst trouble has been . he was wounded by the [???] [???] and many of
his folk and his tree - herds have been murdered and destroyed . he has gone up
into the high places [???] among the birches that he loves best [???] and he will not
come down . still [???] i daresay i could get together a fair company of our
younger folks - if i could make them understand the need : if i could rouse
them : we are not a hasty folk . what a pity the re are so few of us ! '
' why are there so few when you have lived in this country so long ? '
asked [???] . ' have a great many died ? '
' oh [???] no ! ' said [???] . ' none have died from inside [???] as you might
say . some have fallen in the evil chances of the long years [???] of course : and
more have grown tree - ish . but there were never many of us and we have not
increased . there have been no entings - - no children [???] you would say [???] not for
a terrible long count of years . you see [???] we lost the [???] . '
' how very sad ! ' said [???] . ' how was it that they all died ? '
' they did not die ! ' said [???] . ' i never said died . we lost them [???] i
said . we lost them and we cannot find them . ' he sighed . ' i thought most folk
knew that . there were songs about the hunt of the ents for the [???] sung
among elves and men from [???] to [???] . they cannot be quite
forgotten . '
' well [???] i am afraid the songs have not come west over the mountains to
the shire [???] ' said merry . ' won ' t you tell us some more [???] or sing us one of the
songs ? '
' yes [???] i will indeed [???] ' said [???] [???] seeming pleased with the request .
' but i cannot tell it properly [???] only in short ; and then we must end our
talk : tomorrow we have councils to call [???] and work to do [???] and maybe a journey
to begin . '
' it is rather a strange and sad story [???] ' he went on after a pause . ' when
the world was young [???] and the woods were wide and wild [???] the ents and the
[???] - - and there were [???] then : ah ! the loveliness of
[???] [???] of [???] the [???] [???] in the days of our youth ! - - they
walked together and they housed together . but our hearts did not go on
growing in the same way : the ents gave their love to things that they met in
the world [???] and the [???] gave their thought to other things [???] for the ents
loved the great trees ; and the wild woods [???] and the [???] of the high hills ;
and they drank of the mountain - streams [???] and ate only such fruit as the trees

let fall in their path ; and they learned of the elves and spoke with the
trees . but the [???] gave their minds to the lesser trees [???] and to the
meads in the sunshine beyond the feet of the forests ; and they saw the sloe
in the thicket [???] and the wild apple and the cherry blossoming in spring [???] and
the green herbs in the [???] in summer [???] and the seeding grasses in the
autumn fields . they did not desire to speak with these things ; but they
wished them to hear and obey what was said to them . the [???] ordered
them to grow according to their wishes [???] and bear leaf and fruit to their
liking ; for the [???] desired order [???] and plenty [???] and peace ( by which they
meant that things should remain where they had set them ) . so the [???]
made gardens to live in . but we ents went on wandering [???] and we only came to
the gardens now and again . then when the darkness came in the north [???] the
[???] crossed the great river [???] and made new gardens [???] and tilled new
fields [???] and we saw them more seldom . after the darkness was overthrown the
land of the [???] blossomed richly [???] and their fields were full of corn .
many men learned the crafts of the [???] and honoured them greatly ; but
we were only a legend to them [???] a secret in the heart of the forest . yet here
we still are [???] while all the gardens of the [???] are wasted : men call
them the brown lands now .
' i remember it was long ago - - in the time of the war between [???]
and the men of the sea - - desire came over me to see [???] again . very
fair she was still in my eyes [???] when i had last seen her [???] though little like
the [???] of old . for the [???] were bent and browned by their
labour ; their hair parched by the sun to the hue of ripe corn and their
cheeks like red apples . yet their eyes were still the eyes of our own
people . we crossed over [???] and came to their land : but we found a
desert : it was all burned and [???] [???] for war had passed over it . but the
[???] were not there . long we called [???] and long we searched ; and we asked
all folk that we met which way the [???] had gone . some said they had
never seen them ; and some said that they had seen them walking away west [???]
and some said east [???] and others south . but nowhere that we went could we find
them . our sorrow was very great . yet the wild wood called [???] and we returned
to it . for many years we used to go out every now and again and look for the
[???] . walking far and wide and calling them by their beautiful names .
but as time passed we went more seldom and wandered less far . and now the
[???] are only a memory for us [???] and our beards are long and grey . the
elves made many songs concerning the search of the ents [???] and some of the

songs passed into the tongues of men . but we made no songs about it [???] being
content to chant their beautiful names when we thought of the [???] . we
believe that we may meet again in a time to come [???] and perhaps we shall find
somewhere a land where we can live together and both be content . but it is
[???] that tha t will only be when we have both lost all that we now
have . and it may well be that that time is drawing near at last . for if
[???] of old destroyed the gardens [???] the enemy today seems likely to wither
all the woods .
' there was an elvish song that spoke of this [???] or at least so i
understand it . it used to be sung up and down the great river . it was never
an entish song [???] mark you : it would have been a very long song in entish ! but
we know it by heart [???] and hum it now and again . this is how it runs in your
tongue :
ent .
when spring unfolds the [???] leaf [???] and sap is in the bough ;
when light is on the wild - wood stream [???] and wind is on the brow ;
when stride is long [???] and breath is deep [???] and keen the mountain - air [???]
come back to me ! come back to me [???] and say my land is fair !

entwife .
when spring is come to garth and field [???] and corn is in the blade ;
when blossom like a shining snow is on the orchard laid ;
when shower and sun upon the earth with fragrance fill the air [???]
i ' ll linger here [???] and will not come [???] because my land is fair .

ent .
when summer lies upon the world [???] and in a noon of gold
beneath the roof of sleeping leaves the dreams of trees unfold ;
when woodland halls are green and cool [???] and wind is in the west [???]
come back to me ! come back to me [???] and say my land is best !

entwife .
when summer warms the hanging fruit and burns the berry brown ;
when straw is gold [???] and ear is white [???] and harvest comes to town ;
when honey [???] [???] and apple swells [???] though wind be in the west [???]
i ' ll linger here beneath the sun [???] because my land is best !


ent .
when winter comes [???] the winter wild that hill and wood shall slay ;
when trees shall fall and starless night devour the sunless day ;
when wind is in the deadly east [???] then in the bitter rain
i ' ll look for thee [???] and call to thee ; i ' ll come to thee again !

entwife .
when winter comes [???] and singing ends ; when darkness falls at last ;
when broken is the barren bough [???] and light and labour past ;
i ' ll look for thee [???] and wait for thee [???] until we meet again :
together we will take the road beneath the bitter rain !

both .
together we will take the road that leads into the west [???]
and far away will find a land where both our hearts may rest . '

[???] ended his song . ' that is how it goes [???] ' he said . ' it is
elvish [???] of course : [???] [???] [???] [???] and soon over . i daresay it is
fair enough . but the ents could say more on their side [???] if they had time !
but now i am going to stand up and take a little sleep . where will you
stand ? '
' we usually lie down to sleep [???] ' said merry . ' we shall be all right
where we are . '
' lie down to sleep ! ' said [???] . ' why of course you do ! hm [???] hoom : i
was forgetting : singing that song put me in mind of old times ; almost
thought that i was talking to young entings [???] i did . well [???] you can lie on the
bed . i am going to stand in the rain . good night ! '
merry and [???] climbed on to the bed and curled up in the soft grass
and fern . it was fresh [???] and sweet - scented [???] and warm . the lights died down [???]
and the glow of the trees faded ; but outside under the arch they could see
old [???] standing [???] motionless [???] with his arms raised above his head . the
bright stars peered out of the sky [???] and lit the falling water as it spilled
on to his fingers and head [???] and dripped [???] dripped [???] in hundreds of silver
drops on to his feet . listening to the tinkling of the drops the [???]
fell asleep .
they woke to find a cool sun shining into the great court [???] and on to
the floor of the bay . shreds of high cloud were overhead [???] running on a stiff

[???] wind . [???] was not to be seen ; but while merry and [???] were
bathing in the basin by the arch [???] they heard him humming and singing [???] as he
came up the path between the trees .
' hoo [???] ho ! good morning [???] merry and [???] ! ' he boomed [???] when he saw
them .
' you sleep long . i have been many a hundred strides already today . now we
will have a drink [???] and go to [???] . '
he poured them out two full bowls from a stone jar ; but from a
different jar . the taste was not the same as it had been the night before :
it was earthier and richer [???] more sustaining and food - like [???] so to speak .
while the [???] drank [???] sitting on the edge of the bed [???] and [???] small
pieces of elf - cake ( more because they felt that eating was a necessary part
of breakfast than because they felt hungry ) [???] [???] stood [???] humming in
entish or elvish or some strange tongue [???] and looking up at the sky .
' where is [???] ? ' [???] ventured to ask .
' hoo [???] eh ? [???] ? ' said [???] [???] turning round . ' it is not a place [???]
it is a gathering of ents - - which does not often happen [???] . but i
have managed to make a fair number promise to come . we shall meet in the
place where we have always met : [???] men call it . it is away south
from here . we must be there before noon . '
before long they set off . [???] carried the [???] in his arms as
on the previous day . at the entrance to the court he turned to the right [???]
stepped over the stream [???] and strode away southwards along the feet of great
tumbled [???] where trees were scanty . above these the [???] saw thickets
of birch and rowan [???] and beyond them dark climbing [???] . soon
[???]
turned a little away from the hills and [???] into deep groves [???] where the
trees were larger [???] taller [???] and thicker than any that the [???] had ever
seen before . for a while they felt faintly the sense of [???] which they
had noticed when they first ventured into fangorn [???] but it soon passed .
[???] did not talk to them . he hummed to himself deeply and
thoughtfully [???] but merry and [???] caught no proper words : it sounded like
boom [???] boom [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] boom [???] boom [???] [???] boom boom [???] [???]
boom [???] and
so on with a constant change of note and [???] . now and again they thought
they heard an answer [???] a hum or a quiver of sound [???] that seemed to come out of
the earth [???] or from boughs above their heads [???] or perhaps from the boles of

the trees ; but [???] did not stop or turn his head to either side .
they had been going for a long while - - [???] had tried to keep count
of the ' ent - strides ' but had failed [???] getting lost at about three thousand - -
when [???] began to slacken his pace . suddenly he stopped [???] put the
[???] down [???] and raised his curled hands to his mouth so that they made a
hollow tube ; then he blew or called through them . a great hoom [???] hom rang out
like a deep - throated horn in the woods [???] and seemed to echo from the trees .
far off there came from several directions a similar hoom [???] hom [???] hoom that
was not an echo but an answer .
[???] now perched merry and [???] on his shoulders and strode on
again [???] every now and then sending out another horn - call [???] and each time the
answers came louder and nearer . in this way they came at last to what looked
like an [???] wall of dark [???] trees [???] trees of a kind that the
[???] had never seen before : they branched out right from the roots [???] and
were [???] clad in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly [???] and they bore
many stiff upright flower - [???] with large shining olive - coloured buds .
turning to the left and [???] this huge hedge [???] came in a
few strides to a narrow entrance . through it a worn path passed and dived
suddenly down a long steep slope . the [???] saw that they were descending
into a great dingle [???] almost as round as a bowl [???] very wide and deep [???] crowned
at the rim with the high dark [???] hedge . it was smooth and [???]
inside [???] and there were no trees except three very tall and beautiful
silver - birches that stood at the bottom of the bowl . two other paths led
down into the dingle : from the west and from the east .
several ents had already arrived . more were coming in down the other
paths [???] and some were now following [???] . as they drew near the [???]
gazed at them . they had expected to see a number of creatures as much like
[???] as one hobbit is like another ( at any rate to a stranger ' s eye ) ;
and they were very much surprised to see nothing of the kind . the ents were
as different from one another as trees from trees : some as different as one
tree is from another of the same name but quite different growth and
history ; and some as different as one tree - kind from another [???] as birch from
beech ; oak from fir . there were a few older ents [???] bearded and [???] like
hale but ancient trees ( though none looked as ancient as [???] ) ; and
there were tall strong ents [???] clean - limbed and smooth - skinned like
forest - trees in their prime ; but there were no young ents [???] no saplings .
altogether there were about two dozen standing on the wide grassy floor of

the dingle [???] and as many more were marching in .
at first merry and [???] were struck chiefly by the variety that they
saw : the many shapes [???] and colours [???] the differences in girth ; and height [???] and
length of leg and arm ; and in the number of toes and fingers ( anything from
three to nine ) . a few seemed more or less related to [???] [???] and reminded
them of beech - trees or oaks . but there were other kinds . some recalled the
chestnut : brown - skinned ents with large [???] hands [???] and short thick
legs . some recalled the ash : tall straight grey ents with many - fingered
hands and long legs ; some the fir ( the tallest ents ) [???] and others the birch [???]
the rowan [???] and the linden . but when the ents all gather ed round [???] [???]
bowing their heads slightly [???] murmuring in their slow musical voices [???] and
looking long and intently at the strangers [???] then the [???] saw that they
were all of the same kindred [???] and all had the same eyes : not all so old or
so deep as [???] ' s [???] but all with the same slow [???] steady [???] thoughtful
expression [???] and the same green [???] .
as soon as the whole company was assembled [???] standing in a wide circle
round [???] [???] a curious and [???] conversation began . the ents
began to murmur slowly : first one joined and then another [???] until they were
all chanting together in a long rising and falling [???] [???] now louder on one
side of the ring [???] now dying away there and rising to a great boom on the
other side . though he could not catch or understand any of the words - - he
supposed the language was entish - - [???] found the sound very pleasant to
listen to at first ; but gradually his attention wavered . after a long time
( and the chant showed no signs of sla [???] ) he found himself wondering [???]
since entish was such an ' [???] ' language [???] whether they had yet got
further than good morning ; and if [???] was to call the roll [???] how many
days it would take to sing all their names . ' i wonder what the entish is for
yes or no [???] ' he thought . he yawned .
[???] was immediately aware of him . ' hm [???] ha [???] hey [???] my [???] ! ' he
said [???] and the other ents all stopped their chant . ' you are a hasty folk [???] i
was forgetting ; and anyway it is [???] listening to a speech you do not
understand . you may get down now . i have told your names to the [???] [???]
and
they have seen you [???] and they have agreed that you are not [???] [???] and that a
new line shall be put in the old lists . we have got no further yet [???] but that
is quick work for an [???] . you and merry can stroll about in the dingle [???]
if you like . there is a well of good water [???] if you need refreshing [???] away

yonder in the north bank . there are still some words to speak before the
moot really begins . i will come and see you again [???] and tell you how things
are going . '
he put the [???] down . before they walked away [???] they bowed low . this
feat seemed to amuse the ents very much [???] to judge by the tone of their
murmurs [???] and the [???] of their eyes ; but they soon turned back to their
own business . merry and [???] climbed up the path that came in from the
west [???] and looked through the opening in the great hedge . long tree - clad
[???] rose from the lip of the dingle [???] and away beyond them [???] above the
fir - trees of the furthest ridge there rose [???] sharp and white [???] the peak of a
high mountain . southwards to their left they could see the forest falling
away down into the grey distance . there far away there was a pale green
glimmer that merry guessed to be a glimpse of the plains of [???] .
' i wonder where [???] is ? ' said [???] .
' i don ' t know quite where we are [???] ' said merry ; ' but that peak is
probably [???] . and as far as i can remember the ring of [???] lies
in a fork or deep cleft at the end of the mountains . it is probably down
behind this great ridge . there seems to be a smoke or haze over there [???] left
of the peak [???] don ' t you think ? '
' what is [???] like ? ' said [???] . ' i wonder what ents can do a bout
it anyway . ' ' so do i [???] ' said merry . ' [???] is a sort of ring of rocks or
hills [???] i think [???] with a flat space inside and an island or pillar of rock in
the middle [???] called orthanc . [???] has a tower on it . there is a gate [???]
perhaps more than one [???] in the [???] wall [???] and i believe there is a
stream running through it ; it comes out of the mountains [???] and flows on
across the gap of [???] . it does not seem the sort of place for ents to
tackle . but i have an odd feeling about these ents : somehow i don ' t think
they are quite as safe and [???] well funny as they seem . they seem slow [???] queer [???]
and patient [???] almost sad ; and yet i believe they could be roused . if that
happened [???] i would rather not be on the other side . '
' yes ! ' said [???] . ' i know what you mean . there might be all the
difference between an old cow sitting and thoughtfully [???] [???] and a bull
charging ; and the change might come suddenly . i wonder if [???] will
rouse them . i am sure he means to try . bu t they don ' t like being roused .
[???] got roused himself last night [???] and then bottled it up again . '
the [???] turned back . the voices of the ents were still rising and
falling in their conclave . the sun had now risen high enough to look over

the high hedge : it gleamed on the tops of the birches and lit the northward
side of the dingle with a cool yellow light . there they saw a little
glittering fountain . they walked along the rim of the great bowl at the feet
of the [???] - it was pleasant to feel cool grass about their toes again [???]
and not to be in a hurry - and then they climbed down to the [???] water .
they drank a little [???] a clean [???] cold [???] sharp draught [???] and sat down on a [???]
stone [???] watching the patches of sun on the grass and the shadows of the
sailing clouds passing over the floor of the dingle . the murmur of the ents
went on . it seemed a very strange and remote place [???] outside their world [???] and
far from everything that had ever happened to them . a great longing came
over them for the faces and voices of their companions . especially for [???]
and sam [???] and for strider .
at last there came a pause in the ent - voices ; and looking up they saw
[???] coming towards them . with another ent at his side .
' hm [???] hoom [???] here i am again [???] ' said [???] . ' are you getting weary [???] or
feeling impatient [???] hmm [???] eh ? well [???] i am afraid that you must not get
impatient yet . we have finished the first stage now ; but i have still got to
explain things again to those that live a long way off [???] far from [???] [???]
and those that i could not get round to before the moot [???] and after that we
shall have to decide what to do . however [???] deciding what to do does not take
ents so long as going over all the facts and events that they have to make
up their minds about . still [???] it is no use denying [???] we shall be here a long
time yet : a couple of days very likely . so i have brought you a companion .
he has an ent - house nearby . [???] is his elvish name . he says he has
already made up his mind and does not need to remain at the moot . hm [???] hm [???] he
is the nearest thing among us to a hasty ent . you ought to get on together .
good - bye ! ' [???] turned and left them .
[???] stood for some time surveying the [???] solemnly ; and they
looked at him [???] wondering when he would show any signs of ' hastiness ' . he was
tall [???] and seemed to be one of the younger ents ; he had smooth shining skin
on his arms and legs ; his lips were ruddy [???] and his hair was grey - green . he
could bend and sway like a slender tree in the wind . at last he spoke [???] and
his voice though [???] was higher and clearer than [???] ' s .
' ha [???] hmm [???] my friends [???] let us go for a walk ! ' he said . ' i am [???] [???]
that is [???] in your language . but it is on ly a [???] [???] of course .
they have called me that ever since i said yes to an elder ent before he had
finished his question . also i drink quickly [???] and go out while some are still

wetting their beards . come with me ! '
he reached down two shapely arms and gave a long - fingered hand to each
of the [???] . all that day they walked about in the woods with him [???]
singing [???] and laughing ; for [???] often laughed . he laughed if the sun
came out from behind a cloud [???] he laughed if they came upon a stream or
spring : then he stooped and [???] his feet and head with water ; he
laughed sometimes at some sound or whisper in the trees . whenever he saw a
rowan - tree he halted a while with his arms stretched out [???] and sang [???] and
swayed as he sang .
at nightfall he brought them to his ent - house : nothing more than a
[???] stone set upon turves under a green bank . rowan - trees grew in a circle
about it [???] and there was water ( as in all ent - houses ) [???] a spring [???] out
from the bank . they talked for a while as darkness fell on the forest . not
far away the voices of the [???] could be heard still going on ; but now
they seemed deeper and less leisurely [???] and every now and again one great
voice would rise in a high and quickening music [???] while all the others died
away . but beside them [???] spoke gently in their own tongue [???] almost
whispering ; and they learned that he belonged to [???] ' s people [???] and the
country where they had lived had been ravaged . that seemed to the [???]
quite enough to explain his ' hastiness ' [???] at least in the matter of [???] .
' there were rowan - trees in my home [???] ' said [???] [???] softly and sadly [???]
' rowan - trees that took root when i was an enting [???] many many years ago in the
quiet of the world . the oldest were planted by the ents to try and please
the [???] ; but they looked at them and smiled and said that they knew
where whiter blossom and richer fruit were growing . yet there are no trees
of all that race [???] the people of the rose [???] that are so beautiful to me . and
these trees grew and grew [???] till the shadow of each was like a green hall [???]
and their red berries in the autumn were a burden [???] and a beauty and a
wonder . birds used to flock there . i like birds [???] even when they chatter ; and
the rowan has enough and to spare . but the birds became [???] and
greedy and tore at the trees [???] and threw the fruit down and did not eat it .
then [???] came with axes and cut down my trees . i came and called them by
their long names [???] but they did not quiver [???] they did not hear or answer : they
lay dead .
o [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] !
o rowan fair [???] upon your hair how white the blossom lay !
o rowan mine [???] i saw you shine upon a summer ' s day [???]

your rind so bright [???] your leaves so light [???] your voice so cool and soft :
upon your head how golden - red the crown you bore aloft !
o rowan dead [???] upon your head your hair is dry and grey ;
your crown is spilled [???] your voice is stilled for ever and a day .
o [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] !
the [???] fell asleep to the sound of the soft singing of [???] [???]
that seemed to lament in many tongues the fall of trees that he had loved .
the next day they spent also in his company [???] but they did not go far
from his ' house ' . most of the time they sat silent under the shelter of the
bank ; for the wind was colder [???] and the clouds closer and greyer ; there was
little sunshine [???] and in the distance the voices of the ents at the moot
still rose and fell [???] sometimes loud and strong [???] sometimes low and sad [???]
sometimes quickening [???] sometimes slow and solemn as a [???] . a second night
came and still the ents held conclave under hurrying clouds and fitful
stars .
the third day broke [???] bleak and windy . at [???] the ents ' voices rose
to a great clamour and then died down again . as the morning wore on the wind
fell and the air grew heavy with expectancy . the [???] could see that
[???] was now listening intently [???] although to them [???] down in the dell of
his ent - house [???] the sound of the moot was faint .
the afternoon came [???] and the sun [???] going west towards the mountains . sent
out long yellow beams between the cracks and [???] of the clouds .
suddenly they were aware that everything wa s very quiet ; the whole forest
stood in listening silence . of course [???] the ent - voices had stopped . what did
that mean ? [???] was standing up erect and tense [???] looking back northwards
towards [???] .
then with a crash came a great ringing shou t : ra - hoom - rah ! the trees
[???] and bent as if a gust had struck them . there was another pause [???] and
then a marching music began like solemn drums [???] and above the rolling beats
and [???] there welled voices singing high and strong .
we come [???] we come with roll of drum : ta - [???] [???] [???] rom !
the ents were coming : ever nearer and louder rose their song :
we come [???] we come with horn and drum : ta - ryna ryna ryna rom !
[???] picked up the [???] and strode from his house .
before long they saw the marching line approaching : the ents were
swinging along with great strides down the slope towards them . [???] was
at their head [???] and some fifty followers were behind him [???] two [???] [???]

keeping step with their feet and beating time with their hands upon their
flanks . as they drew near the flash and [???] of their eyes could be seen .
' hoom [???] hom ! here we come with a boom [???] here we come at last ! ' called
[???] when he caught sight of [???] and the [???] . ' come [???] join the
moot ! we are off . we are off to [???] ! '
' to [???] ! ' the ents cried in many voices .
' to [???] ! '
to [???] ! though [???] be ringed and barred with doors of stone ;
though [???] be strong and hard [???] as cold as stone and bare as bone [???]
we go [???] we go [???] we go to war [???] to hew the stone and break the door ;
for bole and bough are burning now [???] the furnace roars - - we go to war !
to land of gloom with tramp of doom [???] with roll of drum [???] we come [???] we
come ;
to [???] with doom we come !
with doom we come [???] with doom we come !
so they sang as they marched southwards .
[???] [???] his eyes shining [???] swung into the line beside [???] . the
old ent now took the [???] back [???] and set them on his shoulders again [???] and
so they rode proudly at the head of the sin ng company with beating hearts
and heads held high . though they ad expected something to happen eventually [???]
they were amazed at the change that had come over the ents . it seemed now as
sudden as the bursting of a flood that had long been held back by a dike .
' the ents made up their minds rather quickly [???] after all [???] didn ' t they ? '
[???] ventured to say after some time [???] when for a moment the singing
paused [???] and only the beating of hands and feet was heard .
' quickly ? ' said [???] . ' hoom ! yes [???] indeed . quicker than i expected .
indeed i have not seen them roused like this for many an age . we ents do not
like being roused ; and we never are roused unless it is clear to us that our
trees and our lives are in great danger . that has not happened in this
forest since the wars of [???] and the men of the sea . it is the orc - work [???]
the wanton hewing - - [???] - - without even the bad excuse of feeding the
fires [???] that has so angered us ; and the treachery of a neighbour [???] who should
have helped us . [???] ought to know better : they do know better . there is
no curse in elvish [???] entish [???] or the tongues of men bad enough for such
treachery . down with [???] ! '
' will you really break the doors of [???] ? ' asked merry .
' ho [???] hm [???] well [???] we could [???] you know ! you do not know [???] perhaps . how strong

we are . maybe you have heard of [???] ? they are mighty strong . but [???]
are only counterfeits . made by the enemy in the great darkness [???] in mockery
of ents [???] as [???] were of elves . we are stronger than [???] . we are made of
the bones of the earth . we can split stone like the roots of trees [???] only
quicker [???] far quicker [???] if our minds are roused ! if we are not hewn down [???] or
destroyed by fire or blast of [???] [???] we could split [???] into
[???] and crack its walls into rubble . '
' but [???] will try to stop you . won ' t he ? '
' hm [???] ah [???] yes [???] that is so . i have not forgotten it . indeed i have
thought long about it . but . you see [???] many of the ents are younger than i am .
by many lives of trees . they are all roused now . and their mind is all on
one thing : breaking [???] . but they will start thinking again before
long ; they will cool down a little . when we take our evening drink . what a
thirst we shall have ! but let them march now and sing ! we have a long way to
go [???] and there is time ahead for thought . it is something to have started . '
[???] marched on [???] singing with the others for a while . but after a
time his voice died to a murmur and fell silent again . [???] could see that
his old brow was wrinkled and knotted . at last he looked up [???] and [???]
could see a sad look in his eyes [???] sad but not unhappy . there was a light in
them [???] as if the green flame had sunk deeper into the dark wells of his
thought .
' of course [???] it is likely enough [???] my friends [???] ' he said slowly [???] ' likely
enough that we are going to our doom : the last march of the ents . but if we
stayed at home and did noth ing [???] doom would find us anyway [???] sooner or later .
that thought has long been growing in our hearts ; and that is why we are
marching now . it was not a hasty resolve . now at least the last march of the
ents may be worth a song . aye [???] ' he sighed [???] ' we may help the other peoples
before we pass away . still [???] i should have liked to see the songs come true
about the [???] . i should dearly have liked to see [???] again . but
there [???] my friends [???] songs like trees bear fruit only in their own time and
their own way : and sometimes they are withered untimely . '
the ents went striding on at a great pace . they had descended into a
long fold of the land that fell away southward ; now they began to climb up [???]
and up [???] on to the high western ridge . the woods fell away and they came to
scattered groups of birch [???] and then to bare [???] where only a few gaunt
pine - trees grew . the sun sank behind the dark hill - back in front . grey [???]
fell .

[???] looked behind . the number of the ents had grown - - or what was
happening ? where the dim bare [???] that they had crossed should lie [???] he
thought he saw groves of trees . but they were moving ! could it be that the
trees of fangorn were awake [???] and the forest was rising [???] marching over the
hills to war ? he rubbed his eyes wondering if sleep and shadow had deceived
him ; but the great grey shapes moved steadily onward . there was a noise like
wind in many branches . the ents were drawing near the crest of the ridge
now [???] and all song had ceased . night fell [???] and there was silence : nothing was
to be heard save a faint quiver of the earth beneath the feet of the ents [???]
and a rustle [???] the shade of a whisper as of many drifting leaves . at last
they stood upon the summit [???] and looked down into a dark pit : the great cleft
at the end of the mountains : nan [???] [???] the valley of [???] .
' night lies over [???] [???] ' said [???] .




chapter 5 . the white rider



' my very bones are chilled [???] ' said [???] [???] flapping his arms and stamping
his feet . day had come at last . at dawn the companions had made such
breakfast as they could ; now in the growing light they were getting ready to
search the ground again for signs of the [???] .
' and do not forget that old man ! ' said [???] . ' i should be happier if i
could see the print of a boot . '
' why would that make you happy ? ' said legolas .
' because an old man with feet that leave marks might be no more than he
seemed [???] ' answered the dwarf .
' maybe [???] ' said the elf ; ' but a heavy boot might leave no print here : the
grass is deep and springy . '
' that would not [???] a ranger [???] ' said [???] . ' a bent blade is enough
for [???] to read . but i do not expect him to find any traces . it was an
evil [???] of [???] that we saw last night . i am sure of it [???] even under
the light of morning . his eyes are looking out on us from fangorn even now [???]
maybe . '
' it is likely enough [???] ' said [???] ; ' yet i am not sure . i am thinking
of the horses . you said last night [???] [???] [???] that they were scared away . bu t i
did not think so . did you hear them [???] legolas ? did they sound to you like
beasts in terror ? '
' no [???] ' said legolas . ' i heard them clearly . but for the darkness and our
own fear i should have guessed that they were beasts wild with some sudden
gladness . they spoke as horses will when they meet a friend that they have
long missed . '
' so i thought [???] ' said [???] ; ' but i cannot read the riddle [???] unless
they return . come ! the light is growing fast . let us look first and guess
later ! we should begin here [???] near to our own camping - ground [???] searching
carefully all about [???] and working up the slope towards the forest . to find
the [???] is our errand [???] whatever we may think of our visitor in the
night . if they escaped by some chance [???] then they must have hidden in the
trees [???] or they would have been seen . if we find nothing between here and the
eaves of the wood [???] then we will make a last search upon the battle - field and
among the ashes . but there is little hope there : the horsemen of [???] did

their work too well . '
for some time the companions [???] and groped upon the ground . the
tree stood mournfully above them [???] its dry leaves now hanging limp [???] and
rattling in the chill [???] wind . [???] moved slowly away . he came to
the ashes of the watch - fire near the river - bank [???] and then began to retrace
the ground back towards the knoll where the battle had been fought . suddenly
he stooped and bent low with his face almost in the grass . then he called to
the others . they came running up .
' here at last we find news ! ' said [???] . he lifted up a broken leaf
for them to see [???] a large pale leaf of golden hue [???] now fading and turning
brown . ' here is a mallorn - leaf of [???] [???] and there are small [???] on it [???]
and a few more [???] in the grass . and see ! there are some pieces of cut
cord lying nearby ! '
' and here is the knife that cut them ! ' said [???] . he stooped and drew
out of a [???] [???] into which some heavy foot had trampled it [???] a short jagged
blade . the haft from which it had been snapped was beside it . ' it was an
orc - weapon [???] ' he said [???] holding it [???] [???] and looking with disgust at the
carved handle : it had been shaped like a hideous head with [???] eyes
and leering mouth .
' well [???] here is the strangest riddle that we have yet found ! ' exclaimed
legolas . ' a bound prisoner escapes both from the [???] and from the
[???] horsemen . he then stops [???] while still in the open [???] and cuts his
bonds with an orc - knife . but how and why ? for if his legs were tied [???] how did
he walk ? and if his arms were tied [???] how did he use the knife ? and if neither
were tied [???] why did he cut the cords at all ? being pleased with his skill [???] he
then sat down and quietly ate some [???] ! that at least is enough to show
that he was a hobbit [???] without the mallorn - leaf . after that [???] i suppose [???] he
turned his arms into wings and flew away singing into the trees . it should
be easy to find him : we only need wings ourselves ! '
' there was [???] here right enough [???] ' said [???] . ' what was that old
man doing ? what have you to say [???] [???] [???] to the reading of legolas . can you
better it ? '
' maybe [???] i could [???] ' said [???] [???] smiling . ' there are some other signs
near at hand that you have not considered . i agree that the prisoner was a
hobbit and must have had either legs or hands free [???] before he came here . i
guess that it was hands [???] because the riddle then becomes easier [???] and also
because [???] as i read the marks [???] he was carried to this point by an orc . blood

was spilled there [???] a few paces away [???] orc - blood . there are deep prints of
[???] all about this spot [???] and signs that a heavy thing was dragged away .
the orc was slain by horsemen [???] and later his body was hauled to the fire .
but the hobbit was not seen : he was not [???] in the open [???] [???] for it was night and
he still had his elven - cloak . he was exhausted and hungry [???] and it is not to
be wondered at that [???] when he had cut his bonds with the knife of his fallen
enemy [???] he rested and ate a little before he crept away . but it is a comfort
to know that he had some [???] in his pocket [???] even though he ran away
without gear or pack ; that [???] perhaps [???] is like a hobbit . i say he [???] though i
hope and guess that both merry and [???] were here together . there is [???]
however [???] nothing to show that for certain . '
' and how do you suppose that either of our friends came to have a hand
free ? ' asked [???] .
' i do not know how it happened [???] ' answered [???] . ' nor do i know why
an orc was carrying them away . not to help them to escape [???] we may be sure .
nay [???] rather i think that i now begin to understand a matter that has puzzled
me from the beginning : why when [???] had fallen were the [???] content
with the capture of merry and [???] ? they did not seek out the rest of us [???]
nor attack our camp ; but instead they went with all speed towards [???] .
did they suppose they had captured the ring - bearer and his faithful comrade ?
i think not . their masters would not dare to give such plain orders to [???] [???]
even if they knew so much themselves ; they would not speak openly to them of
the ring : they are not trusty servants . but i think the [???] had been
commanded to capture [???] [???] alive [???] at all costs . an attempt was made to
slip out with the precious prisoners before the battle . treachery perhaps [???]
likely enough with such folk ; some large and bold orc may have been trying
to escape with the prize alone [???] for his own ends . there [???] that is my tale .
others might be devised . but on this we may count in any case : one at least
of our friends escaped . it is our task to find him and help him before we
return to [???] . we must not be [???] by fangorn [???] since need drove him
into that dark place . '
' i do not know which [???] me more : fangorn [???] or the thought of the
long road through [???] on foot [???] ' said [???] .
' then let us go to the forest [???] ' said [???] .
it was not long before [???] found fresh signs . at one point [???] near
the bank of the [???] [???] he came upon [???] : hobbit - prints [???] but too
light for much to be made of them . then again beneath the bole of a great

tree on the very edge of the wood more prints were discovered . the earth was
bare and dry [???] and did not reveal much .
' one hobbit at least stood here for a while and looked back ; and then
he turned away into the forest [???] ' said [???] .
' then we must go in [???] too [???] ' said [???] . ' but i do not like the look of
this fangorn : and we were warned against it . i wish the chase had led
anywhere else ! '
' i do not think the wood feels evil [???] whatever tales may say [???] ' said
legolas . he stood under the eaves of the forest [???] stooping forward [???] as if he
were listening [???] and peering with wide eyes into the shadows . ' no [???] it is not
evil ; or what evil is in it is far away . i catch only the faintest echoes of
dark places where the hearts of the trees are black . there is no malice near
us ; but there is watchfulness [???] and anger . '
' well [???] it has no cause to be angry with me [???] ' said [???] . ' i have done
it no harm . '
' that is just as well [???] ' said legolas . ' but nonetheless it has suffered
harm . there is something happening inside [???] or going to happen . do you not
feel the [???] ? it takes my breath . '
' i feel the air is stuffy [???] ' said the dwarf . ' this wood is lighter than
[???] [???] but it is musty and [???] . '
' it is old [???] very old [???] ' said the elf . ' so old that almost i feel young
again [???] as i have not felt since i journeyed with you children . it is old and
full of memory . i could have been happy here [???] if i had come in days of
peace . '
' i dare say you could [???] ' snorted [???] . ' you are a wood - elf [???] anyway [???]
though elves of any kind are strange folk . yet you comfort me . where you go [???]
i will go . but keep your bow ready to hand [???] and i will keep my axe loose in
my belt . not for use on trees [???] ' he added hastily [???] looking up at the tree
under which they stood . ' i do not wish to meet that old man at [???]
without an argument ready to hand [???] that is all . let us go ! '
with that the three hunters [???] into the forest of fangorn . legolas
and [???] left the tracking to [???] . there was little for him to see . the
floor of the forest was dry and covered with a drift of leaves ; but guessing
that the [???] would stay near the water [???] he returned oft en to the banks
of the stream . so it was that he came upon the place where merry and [???]
had drunk and bathed their feet . there plain for all to see were the
[???] of two [???] [???] one somewhat smaller than the other .

' this is good tidings [???] ' said [???] . ' yet the marks are two days old
and it seems that at this point the [???] left the water - side . '
' then what shall we do now ? ' said [???] . ' we cannot pursue them through
the whole fastness of fangorn . we have come ill supplied . if we do not find
them soon [???] we shall be of no use to them [???] except to sit down beside them and
show our friendship by starving together . '
' if that is indeed all we can do [???] then we must do that [???] ' said [???] .
' let us go on . '
they came at length to the steep abrupt end of [???] ' s hill and
looked up at the rock - wall with its rough steps leading to the high shelf .
gleams of sun were striking through the hurrying clouds [???] and the forest now
looked less grey and drear .
' let us go up a nd look about us ! ' said legolas . ' i will feel my breath
short . i should like to taste a freer air for a while . '
the companions climbed up . [???] came last [???] moving slowly : he was
[???] the steps and ledges closely .
' i am almost sure that the [???] have been up here [???] ' he said . ' but
there are other marks [???] very strange marks [???] which i do not understand . i
wonder if we can see anything from this ledge which will help us to guess
which way they went next ? '
he stood up and looked about [???] but he saw nothing that was of any use .
the shelf faced southward and eastward ; but only on the east was the view
open . there he could see the heads of the trees descending in ranks towards
the plain from which they had come .
' we have journeyed a long way round [???] ' said legolas . ' we could have all
come here safe together [???] if we had left the great river on the second or
third day and struck west . few can foresee whither their road will lead
them [???] till they come to its end . '
' but we did not wish to come to fangorn [???] ' said [???] .
' yet here we are - and nicely caught in the net [???] ' said legolas . ' look ! '
' look at what ? ' said [???] .
' there in the trees . '
' where ? i have not elf - eyes . '
' hush ! speak more softly ! look ! ' said legolas pointing . ' down in the
wood [???] back in the way that we have just come . it is he . cannot you see him [???]
passing from tree to tree ? '
' i see [???] i see now ! ' [???] [???] . ' look [???] [???] ! did i not warn you ?

there is the old man . all in dirty grey rags : that is why i could not see
him at first . '
[???] looked and beheld a bent figure moving slowly . it was not far
away . it looked like an old beggar - man [???] walking wearily [???] leaning on a rough
staff . his head was bowed [???] and he did not look towards them . in other lands
they would have greeted him with kind words ; but now they stood silent [???] each
feeling a strange expectancy : something was approaching that held a hidden
power - or menace .
[???] gazed with wide eyes for a while [???] as step by step the figure drew
nearer . then suddenly [???] unable to contain himself longer [???] he burst out : ' your
bow [???] legolas ! bend it ! get ready ! it is [???] . do not let him speak [???] or
put a spell upon us ! shoot first ! '
legolas took his bow and bent it [???] slowly and as if some other will
resisted him . he held an arrow loosely in his hand but did not fit it to the
string . [???] stood silent [???] his face was watchful and intent .
' why are you waiting ? what is the matter with you ? ' said [???] in a
hissing whisper .
' legolas is right [???] ' said [???] quietly . ' we may not shoot an old man
so [???] at [???] and [???] [???] whatever fear or doubt be on us . watch and
wait ! '
at that moment the old man quickened his pace and came with surprising
speed to the foot of the rock - wall . then suddenly he looked up [???] while they
stood motionless looking down . there was no sound .
they could not see his face : he was hooded [???] and above the hood he wore
a wide - brimmed hat [???] so that all his features were over - shadowed [???] except for
the end of his nose and his grey beard . yet it seemed to [???] that he
caught the gleam of eyes keen and bright from within the shadow of the
hooded brows .
at last the old man broke the silence . ' well met indeed [???] my friends [???] '
he said in a soft voice . ' i wish to speak to you . will you come down or
shall i come up ? ' without waiting for an answer he began to climb .
' now ! ' said [???] . ' stop him [???] legolas ! '
' did i not say that i wished to speak to you ? ' said the old man . ' put
away that bow [???] master elf ! '
the bow and arrow fell from legolas ' hands [???] and his arms hung loose at
his sides .
' and you [???] master dwarf [???] pray take your hand from your axe - haft [???] till i

am up ! you will not need such arguments . '
[???] started and then stood still as stone [???] staring [???] while the old man
sprang up the rough steps as nimbly as a goat . all weariness seemed to have
left him . as he stepped up on to the shelf there was a gleam [???] too brief for
certainty [???] a quick glint of white [???] as if some garment shrouded by the grey
rags had been for an instant revealed the intake of [???] ' s breath could be
heard as a loud hiss in the silence .
' well met [???] i say again ! ' said the old man [???] coming towards them . when he
was a few feet away [???] he stood [???] stooping over his staff [???] with his head thrust
forward [???] peering at them from under his hood . ' and what may you be doing in
these parts ? an elf [???] a man [???] and a dwarf . all clad in elvish fashion . no
doubt there is a tale worth hearing behind it all . such things are not often
seen here . '
' you speak as one that knows fangorn well [???] ' said [???] . ' is that so ? '
' not well [???] ' said the old man : ' that would be the study of many lives .
but i come here now and again . '
' might we know your name [???] and then hear what it is that you have to say
to us ? ' said [???] . ' the morning passes [???] and we have an errand that will
not wait . '
' as for what i wished to say [???] i have said it : what may you be doing [???]
and what tale can you tell of yourselves ? as for my name ! ' he broke off [???]
laughing long and softly . [???] felt a shudder run through him at the
sound [???] a strange cold thrill ; and yet it was not fear or terror that he
felt : rather it was like the sudden bite of a keen air [???] or the slap of a
cold rain that wakes an uneasy sleeper .
' my name ! ' said the old man again . ' have you not guessed it already ?
you have heard it before [???] i think . yes [???] you have heard it before . but come
now [???] what of your tale ? '
the three companions stood silent and made no answer .
' there are some who would begin to doubt whether your errand is fit to
tell [???] ' said the old man . ' happily i know something of it . you are tracking
the [???] of two young [???] [???] i believe . yes [???] [???] . don ' t stare [???] as
if you had never heard the strange name before . you have [???] and so have i .
well [???] they climbed up here the day before yesterday ; and they met someone
that they did not expect . does that comfort you ? and now you would like to
know where they were taken ? well [???] well [???] maybe i can give you some news
about

that . but why are we standing ? your errand [???] you see [???] is no longer as urgent
as you thought . let us sit down and be more at ease . '
the old man turned away and went towards a heap of fallen stones and
rock at the foot of the cliff behind . immediately [???] as if a spell had been
removed [???] the others [???] and stirred . [???] ' s hand went at once to his
axe - haft . [???] drew his sword . legolas picked up his bow .
the old man took no notice [???] but stooped and sat himself on a low flat
stone . then his grey cloak drew apart [???] and they saw [???] beyond doubt [???] that he
was clothed beneath all in white .
' [???] ! ' cried [???] [???] springing towards him with axe in hand . ' speak !
tell us where you have hidden our friends ! what have you done with them ?
speak [???] or i will make a dint in your hat that even a [???] will find it
hard to deal with ! '
the old man was too quick for him . he sprang to his feet and leaped to
the top of a large rock . there he stood [???] grown suddenly tall [???] towering above
them . his hood and his grey rags were flung away . his white garments shone .
he lifted up his staff [???] and [???] ' s axe leaped from his grasp and fell
ringing on the ground . the sword of [???] [???] stiff in his motionless hand [???]
blazed with a sudden fire . legolas gave a great shout and shot an arrow high
into the air : it vanished in a flash of flame .
' [???] ! ' he cried . ' [???] ! '
' well met [???] i say to you again . legolas ! ' said the old man .
they all gazed at him . his hair was white as snow in the sunshine ; and
gleaming white was his robe ; the eyes under his deep brows were bright [???]
piercing as the rays of the sun ; power was in his hand . between wonder [???] joy [???]
and fear they stood and found no words to say .
at last [???] stirred . ' [???] ! ' he said . ' beyond all hope you
return to us in our need ! what veil was over my sight ? [???] ! ' [???] said
nothing [???] hut sank to his knees [???] shading his eyes .
' [???] [???] ' the old man repeated [???] as if recalling from old memory a long
disused word . ' yes [???] that was the name . i was [???] . '
he stepped down from the rock [???] and picking up his grey cloak wrapped it
about him : it seemed as if the sun had been shining [???] but now was hid in
cloud again . ' yes [???] you may still call me [???] [???] ' he said [???] and the voice
was the voice of their old friend and guide . ' get up [???] my good [???] ! no
blame to you [???] and no harm done to me . indeed my friends [???] none of you have
any weapon that could hurt me . be merry ! we meet again . at the turn of the

tide . the great storm is coming [???] but the tide has turned . '
he laid his hand on [???] ' s head [???] and the dwarf looked up and laughed
suddenly . ' [???] ! ' he said . ' but you are all in white ! '
' yes [???] i am white now [???] ' said [???] . ' indeed i am [???] [???] one might
almost say [???] [???] as he should have been . but come now [???] tell me of
yourselves ! i have passed through fire and deep water [???] since we parted . i
have forgotten much that i thought i knew [???] and learned again much that i had
forgotten . i can see many things far off [???] but many things that are close at
hand i cannot see . tell me of yourselves ! '
' what do you wish to know ? ' said [???] . ' all that has happened since
we parted on the bridge would be a long tale . will you not first give us
news of the [???] ? did you find them [???] and are they safe ? '
' no [???] i did not find them [???] ' said [???] . ' there was a darkness over the
[???] of the emyn muil [???] and i did not know of their captivity [???] until the
eagle told me . '
' the eagle ! ' said legolas . ' i have seen an eagle high and far off : the
last time was three days ago [???] above the emyn muil . '
' yes [???] ' said [???] [???] ' that was [???] the windlord [???] who rescued me
from orthanc . i sent him before me to watch the river and gather tidings .
his sight is keen [???] but he cannot see all that passes under hill and tree .
some things he has seen [???] and others i have seen myself . the ring now has
passed beyond my help [???] or the help of any of the company that set out from
[???] . very nearly it was revealed to the enemy [???] but it escaped . i had
some part in that : for i sat in a high place [???] and i strove with the dark
tower ; and the shadow passed . then i was weary [???] very weary ; and i walked
long in dark thought . '
' then you know about [???] ! ' said [???] . ' how do things go with him ? '
' i cannot say . he was saved from a great peril [???] but many lie before him
still . he resolved to go alone to [???] [???] and he set out : that is all that i
can say . '
' not alone [???] ' said legolas . ' we think that sam went with him . '
' did he ! ' said [???] [???] and there was a gleam in his eye and a smile on
his face . ' did he indeed ? it is news to me [???] yet it does not surprise me .
good ! very good ! you lighten my heart . you must tell me more . now sit by
me
and tell me the tale of your journey . '
the companions sat on the ground at his feet [???] and [???] took up the

tale . for a long while [???] said nothing [???] and he asked no quest ions . his
hands were spread upon his knees [???] and his eyes were closed . at last when
[???] spoke of the death of [???] and of his last journey upon the great
river [???] the old man sighed .
' you have not said all that you know or guess [???] [???] my friend [???] ' he
said quietly . ' poor [???] ! i could not see what happened to him . it was a
sore trial for such a man : a warrior [???] and a lord of men . [???] told me
that he was in peril . but he escaped in the end . i am glad . it was not in
vain that the young [???] came with us [???] if only for [???] ' s sake . but
that is not the only part they have to play . they were brought to fangorn [???]
and their coming was like the falling of small stones that starts an
[???] in the mountains . even a s we talk here [???] i hear the first
[???] . [???] had best not be caught away from home when the dam
bursts ! '
' in one thing you have not changed [???] dear friend [???] ' said [???] : ' you
still speak in [???] . '
' what ? in [???] ? ' sa id [???] . ' no ! for i was talking aloud to
myself . a habit of the old : they choose the wisest person present to speak
to ; the long [???] needed by the young are wearying . ' he laughed [???] but
the sound now seemed warm and kindly as a gleam of sunshine .
' i am no longer young even in the reckoning of men of the ancient
houses [???] ' said [???] . ' will you not open your mind more clearly to me ? '
' what then shall i say ? ' said [???] [???] and paused for a while in
thought . ' this in brief is how i see things at the moment [???] if you wish to
have a piece of my mind as plain as possible . the enemy [???] of course [???] has long
known that the ring is abroad [???] and that it is borne by a hobbit . he knows
now the number of our company that set out fr om [???] [???] and the kind of
each of us . but he does not yet perceive our purpose clearly . he supposes
that we were all going to minas [???] ; for that is what he would himself
have done in our place . and according to his wisdom it would have been a
heavy stroke against his power . indeed he is in great fear [???] not knowing what
mighty one may suddenly appear [???] [???] the ring [???] and assailing him with
war [???] seeking to cast him down and take his place . that we should wish to
cast him down and have no one in his place is not a thought that occurs to
his mind . that we should try to destroy the ring itself has not yet entered
into his darkest dream . in which no doubt you will see our good fortune and
our hope . for imagining war he has let loose war [???] believing that he has no

time to waste ; for he that strikes the first blow [???] if he strikes it hard
enough [???] may need to strike no more . so the forces that he has long been
preparing he is now setting in motion [???] sooner than he intended . wise fool .
for if he had used all his power to guard [???] [???] so that none could enter [???]
and bent all his guild to the hunting of the ring [???] then indeed hope would
have faded : neither ring nor bearer could long have eluded him . but now his
eye gazes abroad rather than near at home ; and mostly he looks towards minas
[???] . very soon now his strength will fall upon it like a storm .
' for already he knows that the messengers that he sent to waylay the
company have failed again . they have not found the ring . neither have they
brought away any [???] as hostages . had they done even so much as that [???] it
would have been a heavy blow to us [???] and it might have been fatal . but let us
not darken our hearts by imagining the trial of their gentle loyalty in the
dark tower . for the enemy has failed - so far . thanks to [???] : '
' then is not [???] a traitor ? ' said [???] .
' indeed yes [???] ' said [???] . ' doubly . and is not that strange ? nothing
that we have endured of late has seemed so grievous as the treason of
[???] . even reckoned as a lord and captain [???] has grown very strong .
he threatens the men of [???] and draws off their help from minas [???] [???]
even as the main blow is approaching from the east . yet a treacherous weapon
is ever a danger to the hand . [???] also had a mind to capture the ring [???]
for himself [???] or at least to snare some [???] for his evil purposes . so
between them our enemies have contrived only to bring merry and [???] with
marvellous speed [???] and in the nick of time [???] to fangorn [???] where otherwise they
would never have come at all !
' also they have filled themselves with new doubts that disturb their
plans . no tidings of the battle will come to [???] [???] thanks to the horsemen
of [???] ; but the dark lord knows that two [???] were taken in the emyn
muil and borne away towards [???] against the will of his own servants .
he now has [???] to fear as well as minas [???] . if minas [???] falls [???]
it will go ill with [???] . '
' it is a pity that our friends lie in between [???] ' said [???] . ' if no land
divided [???] and [???] [???] then they could fight while we watched and
waited . '
' the victor would [???] stronger than either [???] and free from doubt [???] '
said [???] . ' but [???] cannot figh t [???] [???] unless [???] first
obtains the ring . that he will never do now . he does not yet know his peril .

there is much that he does not know . he was so eager to lay his hands on his
prey that he could not wait at home [???] and he came forth to meet and to spy on
his messengers . but he came too late [???] for once [???] and the battle was over and
beyond his help before he reached these parts . he did not remain here long .
i look into his mind and i see his doubt . he has no woodcraft . he believes
that the horsemen slew and burned all upon the field of battle ; but he does
not know whether the [???] were bringing any prisoners or not . and he does
not know of the quarrel between his servants and the [???] of [???] ; nor
does he know of the winged messenger . '
' the winged messenger ! ' cried legolas . ' i shot at him with the bow of
[???] above sarn [???] [???] and i felled him from the sky . he filled us all
with fear . what new terror is this ? '
' one that you cannot slay with arrows [???] ' said [???] . ' you on ly slew
his steed . it was a good deed ; but the rider was soon horsed again . for he
was a [???] [???] one of the nine [???] who ride now upon winged steeds . soon their
terror will [???] the last armies of our friends [???] cutting off the sun .
but they have not yet been allowed to cross the river [???] and [???] does not
know of this new shape in which the [???] have been clad . his thought
is ever on the ring . was it present in the battle ? was it found ? what if
[???] [???] lord of the mark [???] should come by it and learn of its power ? that is
the danger that he sees [???] and he has fled back to [???] to double and
treble his assault on [???] . and all the time there is another danger [???] close
at hand [???] which he does not see [???] busy with his fiery thoughts . he has
forgotten [???] . '
' now you speak to yourself again [???] ' said [???] with a smile .
' [???] is not known to me . and i have guessed part of [???] ' s double
treachery ; yet i do not see in what way the coming of two [???] to fangorn
has served [???] save to give us a long and fruitless chase . '
' wait a minute ! ' cried [???] . ' there is another thing that i should
like to know first . was it you [???] [???] [???] or [???] that we saw last night ? '
' you certainly did not see me [???] ' answered [???] [???] ' therefore i must
guess that you saw [???] . evidently we look so much alike that your desire
to make an incurable dent in my hat must be excused . '
' good [???] good ! ' said [???] . ' i am glad that it was not you . '
[???] laughed again . ' yes [???] my good dwarf [???] ' he said [???] ' it is a comfort
not to be mistaken at all points . do i not know it only too well ! but [???] of
course [???] i never blamed you for your welcome of me . how could i do so [???] who

have so often counselled my friends to suspect even their own hands when
dealing with the enemy . bless you [???] [???] [???] son of [???] ! maybe you will see
us both together one day and judge between us ! '
' but the [???] ! ' legolas broke in . ' we have come far to seek them [???]
and you seem to know where they are . where are they now ? '
' with [???] and the ents [???] ' said [???] .
' the ents ! ' exclaimed [???] . ' then there is truth in the old [???]
about the dwellers in the deep forests and the giant shepherds of the trees ?
are there still ents in the world ? i thought they were only a memory of
ancient days [???] if indeed they were ever more than a legend of [???] . '
' a legend of [???] ! ' cried legolas . ' nay [???] every elf in wilderland has
sung songs of the old [???] and their long sorrow . yet even among us they
are only a memory . if i were to meet one still walking in this world [???] then
indeed i should feel young again ! but [???] : that is only a rendering of
fangorn into the common speech ; yet you seem to speak of a person . who is
this [???] ? '
' ah ! now you are asking much [???] ' said [???] . ' the little that i know of
his long slow story would make a tale for which we have no time now .
[???] is fangorn [???] the guardian of the forest ; he is the oldest of the
ents [???] the oldest living thing that still walks beneath the sun upon this
middle - earth . i hope indeed [???] legolas [???] that you may yet meet him . merry and
[???] have been fortunate : they met him here [???] even where we sit . for he
came here two days ago and bore them away to his dwelling far off by the
roots of the mountains . he often comes here [???] especially when his mind is
uneasy [???] and rumours of the world outside trouble him . i saw him four days
ago striding among the trees [???] and i think he saw me [???] for he paused ; but i
did not speak [???] for i was heavy with thought [???] and weary after my struggle
with the eye of [???] ; and he did not speak either [???] nor call my name . '
' perhaps he also thought that you were [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' but you
speak of him as if he was a friend . i thought fangorn was dangerous . '
' dangerous ! ' cried [???] . ' and so am i [???] very dangerous : more
dangerous than anything you will ever meet [???] unless you are brought alive
before the seat of the dark lord . and [???] is dangerous [???] and legolas is
dangerous . you are beset with dangers [???] [???] son of [???] ; for you are
dangerous yourself [???] in your own fashion . certainly the forest of fangorn is
perilous - not least to those that are too ready with their axes ; and fangorn
himself [???] he is perilous too ; yet he is wise and kindly nonetheless . but now

his long slow wrath is brimming over [???] and all the forest is filled with it .
the coming of the [???] and the tidings that they brought have spilled it :
it will soon be running like a flood ; but its tide is turned against [???]
and the axes of [???] . a thing is about to happen which has not happened
since the elder days : the ents are going to wake up and find that they are
strong . '
' what will they do ? ' asked legolas in astonishment .
' i do not know [???] ' said [???] . ' i do not think they know themselves . i
wonder . ' he fell silent [???] his head bowed in thought .
the others looked at him . a gleam of sun through fleeting clouds fell
on his hands [???] which lay now [???] on his lap : they seemed to be filled
with light as a cup is with water . at last he looked up and gazed straight
at the sun .
' the morning is wearing away [???] ' he said . ' soon we must go . '
' do we go to find our friends and to see [???] ? ' asked [???] .
' no [???] ' said [???] . ' that is not the road that you must take . i have
spoken words of hope . but only of hope . hope is not victory . war is
upon us and all our friends [???] a war in which only the use of the ring
could give us surety of victory . it fills me with great sorrow and great
fear : for much shall be destroyed and all may be lost . i am [???] [???]
[???] the white [???] but black is mightier still . '
he rose and gazed out eastward [???] shading his eyes [???] as if he saw things
far away that none of them could see . then he shook his head . ' no [???] ' he said
in a soft voice [???] ' it has gone beyond our reach . of that at least let us be
glad . we can no longer be tempted to use the ring . we must go down to face a
peril near despair [???] yet that deadly peril is removed . '
he turned . ' come [???] [???] son of [???] ! ' he said . ' do not regret
your choice in the valley of the emyn muil [???] nor call it a vain pursuit . you
chose amid doubts the path that seemed right : the choice was just [???] and it
has been rewarded . for so we have met in time [???] who otherwise might have met
too late . but the quest of your companions is over . your next journey is
marked by your given word . you must go to [???] and seek out [???] in
his
hall . for you are needed . the light of and [???] ril must now be uncovered in the
battle for which it has so long waited . there is war in [???] [???] and worse
evil : it goes ill with [???] . '
' then are we not to see the merry young [???] again ? ' said legolas .

' i did not say so [???] ' said [???] . ' who knows ? have patience . go where
you must go [???] and hope ! to [???] ! i go thither also . '
' it is a long way for a man to walk [???] young or old [???] ' said [???] . ' i
fear the battle will be over long ere i come there . '
' we shall see [???] we shall see [???] ' said [???] . ' will you come now with
me ? '
' yes [???] we will set out together [???] ' said [???] . ' but i do not doubt that
you will come there before me [???] if you wish . ' he rose and looked long at
[???] . the others gazed at them in silence as they stood there facing one
another . the grey figure of the man [???] [???] son of [???] [???] was tall [???] and
stern as stone [???] his hand upon the hilt of his sword ; he looked as if some
king out of the mists of the sea had stepped upon the shores of lesser men .
before him stooped the old figure [???] white ; shining now as if with some light
kindled within [???] bent [???] laden with years [???] but holding a power beyond the
strength of kings .
' do i not say truly [???] [???] [???] ' said [???] at last [???] ' that you could go
whithersoever you wished quicker than i ? and this i also say : you are our
captain and our banner . the dark lord has nine . but we have one [???] mightier
than they : the white rider . he has passed through the fire and the [???] [???]
and they shall fear him . we will go where he leads . '
' yes [???] together we will follow you [???] ' said legolas . ' but first [???] it would
ease my heart [???] [???] [???] to hear what befell you in moria . will you not tell
us ? can you not stay even to tell your friends how you were delivered ? '
' i have stayed already too long [???] ' answered [???] . ' time is short . but
if there were a year to spend [???] i would not tell you all . '
' then tell us what you will [???] and time allows ! ' said [???] . ' come [???]
[???] [???] tell us how you fared with the balrog ! '
' name him not ! ' said [???] [???] and for a moment it seemed that a cloud
of pain passed over his face [???] and he sat silent [???] looking old as death . ' long
time i fell [???] ' he said at last [???] slowly [???] as if thinking back with diffi culty .
' long i fell [???] and he fell with me . his fire was about me . i was burned . then
we [???] into the deep water and all was dark . cold it was as the tide of
death : almost it froze my heart . '
' deep is the [???] that is spanned by durin ' s bridge [???] and none has
measured it [???] ' said [???] .
' yet it has a bottom [???] beyond light and knowledge [???] ' said [???] .
' thither i came at last [???] to the uttermost foundations of stone . he was with

me still . his fire was quenched [???] but now he was a thing of slime [???] stronger
than a strangling snake .
' we fought far under the living earth [???] where time is not counted . ever
he clutched me [???] and ever i hewed him [???] till at last he fled into dark
[???] . they were not made by durin ' s folk [???] [???] son of [???] . far [???] far
below the deepest delving of the [???] [???] the world is gnawed by nameless
things . even [???] knows them not . they are older than he . now i have
walked there [???] but i will bring no report to darken the light of day . in that
despair my enemy was my only hope [???] and i pursued him [???] clutching at his heel .
thus he brought me back at last to the secret ways of [???] - dym : too well
he knew them all . ever up now we went [???] until we came to the endless stair . '
' long has that been lost [???] ' said [???] . ' many have said that it was
never made save in legend [???] but others say that it was destroyed . '
' it was made [???] and it had not been destroyed [???] ' said [???] . ' from the
lowest dungeon to the highest peak it climbed . ascending in [???] spiral
in many thousand steps [???] until it issued at last in durin ' s tower carved in
the living rock of [???] - [???] [???] the [???] of the [???] .
' there upon [???] was a lonely window in the snow [???] and before it lay
a narrow space [???] a [???] eyrie above the mists of the world . the sun shone
fiercely there [???] but all below was wrapped in cloud . out he sprang [???] and even
as i came behind [???] he burst into new flame . there was none to see [???] or perhaps
in after ages songs would still be sung of the battle of the peak . ' suddenly
[???] laughed . ' but what would they say in song ? those that looked up from
afar thought that the mountain was crowned with storm . thunder they heard [???]
and lightning [???] they said [???] smote upon [???] [???] and leaped back broken into
tongues of fire . is not that enough ? a great smoke rose about us [???] vapour and
steam . ice fell like rain . i threw down my enemy [???] and he fell from the high
place and broke the mountain - side where he smote it in his ruin . then
darkness took me ; and i strayed out of thought and time [???] and i wandered far
on roads that i will not tell .
' naked i was sent back - - for a brief time [???] until my task is done . and
naked i lay upon the mountain - top . the tower behind was [???] into dust [???]
the window gone ; the ruined stair was choked with burned and broken stone . i
was alone [???] forgotten [???] without escape upon the hard horn of the world . there
i lay staring upward [???] while the stars wheeled over [???] and each day was as long
as a life - age of the earth . faint to my ears came the gathered rumour of all
lands : the springing and the dying [???] the song and the weeping [???] and the slow

everlasting groan of [???] stone . and so at the last [???] the
windlord found me again [???] and he took me up and bore me away .
' ' ever am i fated to be your burden [???] friend at need [???] ' i said .
' ' a burden you have been [???] ' he answered [???] ' but not so now . light as a
swan ' s feather in my claw you are . the sun shines through you . indeed i do
not think you need me any more : were i to let you fall you would float upon
the wind . '
' ' do not let me fall ! ' i gasped [???] for i felt life in me again . ' bear me
to [???] ! '
' ' that indeed is the command of the lady [???] who sent me to look
for you [???] ' he answered .
' thus it was that i came to caras [???] and found you but lately
gone . i tarried there in the ageless time of that land where days bring
healing not decay . healing i found [???] and i was clothed in white . counsel i
gave and counsel took . thence by strange roads i came [???] and messages i bring
to some of you . to [???] i was bidden to say this :
where now are the d [???] nedain [???] [???] [???] [???] ?
why do thy kinsfolk wander afar ?
near is the hour when the lost should come forth [???]
and the grey company ride from the north .
but dark is the path appointed for thee :
the dead watch the road that leads to the sea .
to legolas she sent this word :
legolas [???] long under tree
in joy thou hast lived . beware of the sea !
if thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore [???]
thy heart shall then rest in the forest no more . '
[???] fell silent and shut his eyes .
' then she sent me no message ? ' said [???] and bent his head .
' dark are her words [???] ' said legolas [???] ' and little do they mean to those
that receive them . '
' that is no comfort [???] ' said [???] .
' what then ? ' said legolas . ' would you have her speak openly to you of
your death ? '
' yes . if she had nought else to say . '
' what is that ? ' said [???] [???] opening his eyes . ' yes [???] i think i can
guess what her words may mean . your pardon [???] [???] ! i was pondering the

messages once again . but indeed she sent words to you [???] and neither dark nor
sad .
' [???] to [???] son of [???] [???] [???] she said [???] [???] give his lady ' s greeting .
lock - bearer [???] wherever thou goest my thought goes with thee . but have a care
to lay thine axe to the right tree ! [???] '
' in happy hour you have returned to us [???] [???] [???] ' cried the dwarf [???]
capering as he sang loudly in the strange dwarf - tongue . ' come [???] come ! ' he
shouted [???] swinging his axe . ' since [???] ' s head is now sacred [???] let us find
one that it is right to cleave ! '
' that will not be far to seek [???] ' said [???] [???] rising from his seat .
' come ! we have spent all the time that is allowed to a meeting of parted
friends . now there is need of haste . '
he wrapped himself again in his old [???] cloak [???] and led the way .
following him they descended quickly from the high shelf and made their way
back through the forest [???] down the bank of the [???] . they spoke no more
words [???] until they stood again upon the grass beyond the eaves of fangorn .
there was no sign of their horses to be seen .
' they have not returned [???] ' said legolas . ' it will be a weary walk ! '
' i shall not walk . time presses [???] ' said [???] . then lifting up his
head he gave a long whistle . so clear and piercing was the note that the
others stood amazed to hear such a sound come from those old bearded lips .
three times he whistled ; and then faint and far off it seemed to them that
they heard the [???] of a horse borne up from the plains upon the eastern
wind . they waited wondering . before long there came the sound of [???] [???] at
first hardly more than a tremor of the ground [???] only to [???] as
he lay upon the grass [???] then growing steadily louder and clearer to a quick
beat .
' there is more than one horse coming [???] ' said [???] .
' certainly [???] ' said [???] . ' we are too great a burden for one . '
' there are three [???] ' sa id legolas [???] gazing out over the plain . ' see how
they run ! there is [???] [???] and there is my friend arod beside him ! but
there is another that strides ahead : a very great horse . i have not seen his
like before . '
' nor will you again [???] ' said [???] . ' that is [???] . he is the chief
of the [???] [???] lords of horses [???] and not even [???] [???] king of [???] [???] has
ever looked on a better . does he not shine like silver [???] and run as smoothly
as a swift stream ? he has come for me : the horse of the white rider . we are

going to battle together . '
even as the old [???] spoke [???] the great horse came striding up the
slope towards them ; his coat was [???] and his mane flowing in the wind
of his speed . the two others followed [???] now far behind . as soon as [???]
saw [???] [???] he checked his pace and [???] loudly ; then trotting gently
forward he stooped his proud head and [???] his great [???] against the
old man ' s neck .
[???] caressed him . ' it is a long way from [???] [???] my friend [???] ' he
said ; ' but you are wise and swift and come at need . far let us ride now
together [???] and part not in this world again ! '
soon the other horses came up and stood quietly by [???] as if [???]
orders . ' we go at once to [???] [???] the hall of your master [???] [???] [???] ' said
[???] [???] addressing them gravely . they bowed their heads . ' time presses [???] so
with your leave [???] my friends [???] we will ride . we beg you to use all the speed
that you can . [???] shall bear [???] and arod legolas . i will set [???]
before me [???] and by his leave [???] shall bear us both . we will wait now
only to drink a little . '
' now i understand a part of last night ' s riddle [???] ' said legolas as he
sprang lightly upon arod ' s back . ' whether they fled at first in fear [???] or
not [???] our horses met [???] [???] their chieftain [???] and greeted him with joy .
did you know that he was at hand [???] [???] ? '
' yes [???] i knew [???] ' said the [???] . ' i bent my thought upon him [???] bidding
him to make haste ; for yesterday he was far away in the south of this land .
swiftly may he bear me back again ! '
[???] spoke now to [???] [???] and the horse set off at a good pace [???]
yet not beyond the measure of the others . after a little while he turned
suddenly [???] and choosing a place where the ba nks were lower [???] he waded the
river [???] and then led them away due south into a flat land [???] treeless and wide .
the wind went like grey waves through the endless miles of grass . there was
no sign of road or track [???] but [???] did not stay or falter .
' he is steering a straight course now for the halls of [???] under
the [???] of the white mountains [???] ' said [???] . ' it will be quicker so .
the ground is firmer in the [???] [???] where the chief northward track lies [???]
across the river [???] but [???] knows the way through every fen and hollow . '
for many hours they rode on through the meads and [???] . often the
grass was so high that it reached above the knees of the riders [???] and their

steeds seemed to be swimming in a grey - green sea . they came upon many
hidden
[???] [???] and broad acres of sedge waving above wet and treacherous bogs ; but
[???] found the way [???] and the other horses followed in his swath . slowly
the sun fell from the sky down into the west . looking out over the great
plain [???] far away the riders saw it for a moment like a red fire sinking into
the grass . low upon the edge of sight shoulders of the mountains glinted red
upon either side . a smoke seemed to rise up and darken the sun ' s disc to the
hue of blood [???] as if it had kindled the grass as it passed down under the rim
of earth .
' there lies the gap of [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' it is now almost due west
of us . that way lies [???] . '
' i see a great smoke [???] ' said legolas . ' what may that be ? '
' battle and war ! ' said [???] . ' ride on ! '




chapter 6 . the king of the golden hall



they rode on through sunset [???] and slow [???] [???] and gathering night . when
at last they halted and [???] [???] even [???] was stiff and weary .
[???] only allowed them a few hou rs ' rest . legolas and [???] slept and
[???] lay flat [???] stretched upon his back ; but [???] stood [???] leaning on his
staff [???] gazing into the darkness [???] east and west . all was silent [???] and there
was no sign or sound of living thing . the night was barred with long clouds [???]
fleeting on a chill wind [???] when they arose again . under the cold moon they
went on once more [???] as swift as by the light of day .
hours passed and still they rode on . [???] nodded and would have fallen
from his seat [???] if [???] had not clutched and shaken him . [???] and arod [???]
weary but proud [???] followed their tireless leader [???] a grey shadow before them
hardly to he seen . the miles went by . the waxing moon sank into the cloudy
west .
a bitter chill came into the air . slowly in the east the dark faded to
a cold grey . red shafts of light leapt above the black walls of the emyn
muil far away upon their left . dawn came clear and bright ; a wind swept
across their path [???] rushing through the bent grasses . suddenly [???]
stood still and neighed . [???] pointed ahead .
' look ! ' he cried [???] and they lifted their tired eyes . before them stood
the mountains of the south : white - tipped and streaked with black . the
grass - lands rolled against the hills that [???] at their feet [???] and
flowed up into many [???] still dim and dark [???] [???] by the light of
dawn [???] winding their way into the heart of the great mountains . immediately
before the travellers the widest of these glens opened like a long gulf
among the hills . far inward they [???] a tumbled mountain - mass with one
tall peak ; at the mouth of the vale there stood like [???] a lonely
height . about its feet there flowed [???] as a thread of silver [???] the stream that
issued from the dale ; upon its brow they caught [???] still far away [???] a glint in
the rising sun [???] a glimmer of gold . ' speak [???] legolas ! ' said [???] . ' tell us
what you see there before us ! '
legolas gazed ahead [???] shading his eyes from the level shafts of the
new - risen sun . ' i see a white stream that comes down from the snows [???] ' he
said . ' where it issues from the shadow of the vale a green hill rises upon

the east . a dike and mighty wall and thorny fence [???] it . within there
rise the roofs of houses ; and in the midst [???] set upon a green terrace [???] there
stands aloft a great hall of men . and it seems to my eyes that it is
thatched with gold . the light of it shines far over the land . golden [???] too [???]
are the posts of its doors . there men in bright mail stand ; but all else
within the courts are yet asleep . '
' [???] those courts are called [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and [???] is that
golden hall . there dwells [???] son of [???] [???] king of the mark of [???] .
we are come with the rising of the day . now the road lies plain to see
before us . but we must ride more warily ; for war is abroad [???] and the
[???] [???] the horse - lords [???] do not sleep [???] even if it seem so from afar . draw
no weapon [???] speak no haughty word [???] i counsel you all [???] until we are come
before [???] ' s seat . '
the morning was bright and clear about them [???] and birds were singing [???]
when the travellers came to the stream . it ran down swiftly into the plain [???]
and beyond the feet of the hills turned across their path in a wide bend [???]
flowing away east to feed the [???] far off in its reed - choked beds . the
land was green : in the wet meads and along the grassy borders of the stream
grew many willow - trees . already in this southern land they were blushing red
at their [???] . feeling the approach of spring . over the stream there
was a ford between low banks much trampled by the passage of horses . the
travellers passed over and came upon a wide rutted track leading towards the
[???] .
at the foot of the walled hill the way ran under the shadow of many
mounds [???] high and green . upon their western sides the grass was white as with
a drifted snow : small flowers sprang there like countless stars amid the
turf .
' look ! ' said [???] . ' how fair are the bright eyes in the grass !
[???] they are called [???] [???] in this land of men [???] for they blossom
in all the seasons of the year [???] and grow where dead men rest . behold ! we are
come to the great barrows where the sires of [???] sleep . ' ' seven mounds
upon the left [???] and nine upon the right [???] ' said [???] . ' many long lives of
men it is since the golden hall was built . '
' five hundred times have the red leaves fallen in [???] in my home
since then [???] ' said legolas [???] ' and but a little while does that seem to us . '
' but to the riders of the mark it seems so long ago [???] ' said [???] [???]
' that the raising of this house is but a memory of song [???] and the years

before are lost in the mist of time . now they call this land their home [???]
their own [???] and their speech is sundered from their northern kin . ' then he
began to chant softly in a slow tongue unknown to the elf and dwarf ; yet
they listened [???] for there was a strong music in it .
' that [???] i guess [???] is the language of the [???] [???] ' said legolas ; ' for it
is like to this land itself ; rich and rolling in part [???] and else hard and
stern as the mountains . but i cannot guess what it means [???] save that it is
laden with the sadness of mortal men . '
' it runs thus in the common speech [???] ' said [???] [???] ' as near as i can
make it .
where now the horse and the rider ? where is the horn that was blowing ?
where is the helm and the [???] [???] and the bright hair flowing ?
where is the hand on the [???] [???] and the red fire glowing ?
where is the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing ?
they have passed like rain on the mountain [???] like a wind in the [???] ;
the days have gone down in the west behind the hills into shadow .
who shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burning [???]
or behold the flowing years from the sea returning ?
thus spoke a forgotten poet long ago in [???] [???] recalling how tall and
fair was [???] the young [???] who rode down out of the north ; and there were
wings upon the feet of his steed [???] [???] [???] father of horses . so men still
sing in the evening . '
with these words the travellers passed the silent mounds . following the
winding way up the green shoulders of the hills [???] they came at last to the
wide wind - swept walls and the gates of [???] .
there sat many men in bright mail [???] who sprang at once to their feet and
barred the way with spears . ' stay [???] strangers here unknown ! ' they cried in
the tongue of the [???] [???] demanding the names and errand of the
strangers . wonder was in their eyes but little friendliness ; and they looked
darkly upon [???] .
' well do i understand your speech [???] ' he answered in the same language ;
' yet few strangers do so . why then do you not speak in the common tongue [???]
as
is the custom in the west [???] if you wi sh to be answered ? '
' it is the will of [???] king that none should enter his gates [???] save
those who know our tongue and are our friends [???] ' replied one of the guards .
' none are welcome here in days of war but our own folk [???] and those that come

from [???] in the land of [???] . who are you that come heedless over
the
plain thus strangely clad [???] riding horses like to our own horses ? long have
we kept guard here [???] and we have watched you from afar . never have we seen
other riders so strange [???] nor any horse more proud than is one of these that
bear you . he is one of the [???] [???] unless our eyes are cheated by some
spell . say [???] are you not a [???] [???] some spy from [???] [???] or [???] of his
craft ? speak now and be swift ! '
' we are no [???] [???] ' said [???] [???] ' nor do your eyes cheat you . for
indeed these are your own horses that we ride [???] as you knew well are you
asked [???] i guess . but seldom does thief ride home to the stable . here are
[???] and arod [???] that jomer [???] the third marsha l of the mark [???] lent to us [???]
only two days ago . we bring them back now [???] even as we promised him . has
not
jomer then returned and given warning of our coming ? '
a troubled look came into the guard ' s eyes . ' of jomer i have naught to
say [???] ' he answered . ' if what you tell me is truth [???] then doubtless [???]
will have heard of it . maybe your coming was not wholly [???] - for . it is
but two nights ago that [???] came to us and said that by the will of
[???] no stranger should pass these gates . '
' [???] ? ' said [???] [???] looking sharply at the guard . ' say no more !
my errand is not to [???] [???] but to the lord of the mark himself . i am in
haste . will you not go or send to say that we are come ? ' his eyes glinted
under his deep brows as he bent his gaze upon the man .
' yes [???] i will go [???] ' he answered slowly . ' but what names shall i report ?
and what shall i say of you ? old and weary you seem now [???] and yet you are
fell and grim beneath [???] i deem '
' well do you see and speak [???] ' said the [???] . ' for i am [???] . i have
returned . and behold ! i too bring back a horse . here is [???] the great [???]
whom no other hand can tame . and here beside me is [???] son of
[???] [???]
the heir of kings [???] and it is to [???] that he goes . here also are legolas
the elf and [???] the dwarf [???] our comrades . go now and say to your master
that we are at his gates and would have speech with him [???] if he will permit
us to come into his hall . ' ' strange names you give indeed ! but i will report
them as you bid and learn my master ' s will [???] ' said the guard . ' wait here a
little while [???] and f will bring you such answer as seems good to him . do not

hope too much ! these are dark days . ' he went swiftly away [???] leaving the
strangers in the watchful keeping of his comrades . after some time he
returned . ' follow me ! ' he said . ' [???] gives you leave to enter ; but any
weapon that you bear ; be it only a staff [???] you must leave on the [???] .
the [???] will keep them . '
the dark gates were swung open . the travellers entered [???] walking in file
behind their guide . they found a broad path [???] paved with hewn stones [???] now
winding upward [???] now climbing in short flights of well - laid steps . many
houses built of wood and many dark doors they passed . beside the way in a
stone channel a stream of clear water flowed [???] sparkling and chattering . at
length they came to the crown of the hill . there stood a high platform above
a green terrace [???] at the foot of which a bright spring [???] from a stone
carved in the likeness of a horse ' s head ; beneath was a wide basin from
which the water . spilled and fed the falling stream . up the green terrace
went a stair of stone [???] high and broad [???] and on either side of the topmost
step were stone - hewn sea [???] there sat other guards [???] with drawn swords laid
upon their knees . their golden hair was braided on their shoulders the sun
was blazoned upon their green shields [???] their long [???] were burnished
bright [???] and when they rose taller they seemed than mortal men .
' there are the doors before you [???] ' said the guide . ' i must return now to
my duty at the gate . farewell ! and may the lord of the mark be gracious to
you ! '
he turned and went swiftly back down the road . the others climbed the
long stair under the eyes of the tall watchmen . silent they stood now above
and spoke no word [???] until [???] stepped out upon the paved terrace at the
stairs head . then suddenly with clear voices they spoke a courteous greeting
in their own tongue .
hail [???] corners from afar ! ' they said [???] and they turned the [???] of their
swords towards the travellers in token of peace . green gems flashed in the
sunlight . then one of the guards stepped forward and spoke in the common
speech .
' i am the doorward of [???] [???] ' he said . ' [???] is my name . here i must
bid you lay aside your weapons before you enter . '
then legolas gave into his hand his silver - [???] knife [???] his quiver and
his bow . ' keep these well [???] ' he said [???] ' for they come from the golden wood and
the lady of [???] gave them to me . '
wonder came into the man ' s eyes [???] and he laid the weapons hastily by the

wall [???] as if he feared to handle them . ' no man will touch them i promise
you [???] ' he said .
[???] stood a while [???] . ' it is not my will [???] ' he said [???] ' to put
aside my sword or to deliver and [???] ril to the hand of any other man . '
' it is the will of [???] [???] ' said [???] .
' it is not clear to me that the will of [???] son of [???] even
though he be lord of the mark [???] should prevail over the will of [???] son
of [???] [???] [???] ' s heir of [???] . '
' this is the house of [???] [???] not of [???] [???] even were he king of
[???] in the seat of [???] [???] ' said [???] [???] stepping swiftly before the
doors and barring the way . his sword was now in his hand and the point
towards the strangers .
' this is idle talk [???] ' said [???] . ' needless is [???] ' s demand [???] but
it is useless to refuse . a king will have his way in his own hall [???] be it
folly or wisdom . '
' truly [???] ' said [???] . ' and i would do as the master of the house bade
me [???] were this only a woodman ' s cot [???] if i bore now any sword but and [???] ril . '
' whatever its name may be [???] ' said [???] [???] ' here you shall lay it [???] if you
would not fight alone against all the men in [???] . '
' not alone ! ' said [???] [???] fingering the blade of his axe [???] and looking
darkly up at the guard [???] as if he were a young tree that [???] had a mind to
fell . ' not alone ! '
' come [???] come ! ' said [???] . ' we are all friends here . or should be ; for
the laughter of [???] will be our only reward [???] if we quarrel . my errand is
pressing . here at least is my sword [???] goodman [???] . keep it well . [???]
it is called [???] for the elves made it long ago . now let me pass . come [???]
[???] ! '
slowly [???] [???] his belt and himself set his sword upright
against the wall . ' here i set it [???] ' he said ; ' but i command you not to touch
it [???] nor to permit any other to lay hand on it . in this elvish heath dwells
the blade that was broken and has been made again . [???] first wrought it
in the deeps of time . death shall come to any man that draws [???] ' s sword
save [???] ' s heir . '
the guard stepped back and looked with amazement on [???] . ' it seems
that you are come on the wings of song out of the forgotten days he said . it
shall be [???] lord [???] as you command .
' well [???] ' said [???] [???] ' if it has and [???] ril to keep it company [???] my axe may

stay here [???] too [???] without shame ' ; and he laid it on the floor . ' now then [???] if
all is as you wish [???] let us go and speak with your master . '
the guard still [???] . ' your staff [???] ' he said to [???] . ' forgive
me [???] but that too must be left at the doors . '
' foolishness ! ' said [???] . ' [???] is one thing [???] but [???] is
another . i am old . if i may not lean on my stick as i go [???] then i will sit
out here [???] until it pleases [???] to hobble out himself to speak with me . '
[???] laughed . ' every man has something too dear to trust to another .
but would you part an old man from his suppor t ? come [???] will you not let us
enter ? '
' the staff in the hand of a [???] may be more than a prop for age '
said [???] . he looked hard at the ash - staff on which [???] leaned . ' yet in
doubt a man of worth will trust to his own wisdom . i believe you are friends
and folk worthy of honour [???] who have no evil purpose . you may go in . '
the guards now lifted the heavy bars of the doors and swung them slowly
inwards grumbling on their great [???] . the travellers entered . inside it
seemed dark and warm after the clear air upon the hill . the hall was long
and wide and filled with shadows and half lights ; mighty pillars [???] its
lofty roof . but here and there bright [???] fell in [???] shafts
from the eastern windows [???] high under the deep eaves . through the [???] in
the roof [???] above the thin wisps of issuing smoke [???] the sky showed pale and
blue . as their eyes changed [???] the travellers perceived that the floor was
paved with stones of many hues ; branching runes and strange devices
[???] beneath their feet . they saw now that the pillars were richly
carved [???] gleaming dully with gold and half - seen colours . many woven cloths
were hung upon the walls [???] and over their wide spaces marched figures of
ancient legend [???] some dim with years [???] some darkling in the shade . but upon
one form the sunlight fell : a young man upon a white horse . he was blowing a
great horn [???] and his yellow hair was flying in the wind . the horse ' s head was
lifted [???] and its [???] were wide and red as it neighed [???] smelling battle
afar . foaming water [???] green and white [???] rushed and curled about its knees .
' behold [???] the young ! ' said [???] . ' thus he rode out of the north
to the battle of the field of celebrant . '
now the four companions went forward [???] past the clear wood - fire burning
upon the long hearth in the midst of the hall . then they halted . at the far
end of the house [???] beyond the hearth and facing north towards the doors [???] was
a dais with three steps ; and in the middle of the dais was a great gilded

chair . upon it sat a man so bent with age that he seemed almost a dwarf ; but
his white hair was long and thick and fell in great braids from beneath a
thin golden circle set upon his brow . in the centre upon his forehead shone
a single white diamond . his beard was laid like snow upon his knees ; but his
eyes still burned with a bright light [???] [???] as he gazed at the
strangers . behind his chair stood a woman clad in white . at his feet upon
the steps sat a [???] figure of a man [???] with a pale wise face and
heavy - [???] eyes .
there was a silence . the old man did not move in his chair . at length
[???] spoke . ' hail [???] [???] son of [???] ! i have returned . for behold !
the storm comes [???] and now all friends should gather together [???] lest each
singly be destroyed . '
slowly the old man rose to his feet [???] leaning heavily upon a short black
staff with a handle of white bone ; and now the strangers saw that [???] bent
though he was [???] he was still tall and must in youth have been high and proud
indeed .
' i greet you [???] ' he said [???] ' and maybe you look for welcome . but truth to
tell your welcome is doubtful here [???] master [???] . you have ever been a
herald of woe . troubles follow you like crows [???] and ever the oftener the
worse . i will not deceive you : when i heard that [???] had come back
riderless [???] i rejoiced at the return of the horse [???] but still more at the lack
of the rider ; and when jomer brought the tidings that you had gone at last
to your long home [???] i did not mourn . but news from afar is seldom sooth . here
you come again ! and with you come evils worse than before [???] as might be
expected . why should i welcome you [???] [???] [???] ? tell me that . '
slowly
he sat down again in his cha ir .
' you speak justly [???] lord [???] ' said the pale man sitting upon the steps of
the dais . ' it is not yet five days since the bitter tidings came that
[???] your son was slain upon the west marches : your right hand [???] second
marshal of the mark . in jomer there is little trust . few men would be left
to guard your walls [???] if he had been allowed to rule . and even now we learn
from [???] that the dark lord is stirring in the east . such is the hour in
which this wanderer chooses to return . why indeed should we welcome you [???]
master [???] ? [???] i name you [???] ill - news ; and ill news is an ill
guest they say . ' he laughed grimly [???] as he lifted his heavy lids for a moment
and gazed on the strangers with dark eyes .

' you are held wise [???] my friend [???] [???] and are doubtless a great
support to your master [???] ' answered [???] in a soft voice . ' yet in two ways
may a man come with evil tidings . lie may be a worker of evil ; or he may be
such as leaves well alone [???] and comes only to bring aid in time of need . '
' that is so [???] ' said [???] ; ' but there is a third kind : pickers of
bones [???] [???] in other men ' s sorrows [???] carrion - fowl that grow fat on war .
what aid have you ever brought [???] [???] ? and what aid do you bring now ?
it
was aid from us that you sought last time that you were here . then my lord
bade you choose any horse that you would and be gone ; and to the wonder of
all you took [???] in your insolence . my lord was sorely grieved ; yet to
some it seemed that to speed you from the land the price was not too great .
i guess that it is likely to turn out the same once more : you will seek aid
rather than render it . do you bring men ? do you bring horses [???] swords [???]
spears ? that i would call aid ; that is our present need . but who are these
that follow at your tail ? three ragged wanderers in grey [???] and you yourself
the most beggar - like of the four ! '
' the courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late [???] [???] son of
[???] [???] ' said [???] . ' has not the messenger from your gate reported the
names of my companions ? seldom has any lord of [???] received three
such
guests . weapons they have laid at your doors that are worth many a mortal
man [???] even the mightiest . grey is their raiment [???] for the elves clad them [???] and
thus they have passed through the shadow of great perils to your hall . '
' then it is true [???] as jomer reported [???] that you are in league with the
[???] of the golden wood ? ' said [???] . ' it is not to be wondered
at : webs of deceit were ever woven in [???] . '
[???] strode a pace forward [???] but felt suddenly the hand of [???]
clutch him by the shoulder [???] and he halted [???] standing stiff as stone .
in [???] [???] in [???]
seldom have walked the feet of men [???]
few mortal eyes have seen the light
that lies there ever [???] long and bright .
[???] ! [???] !
clear is the water of your well ;
white is the star in your white hand ;
[???] [???] unstained is leaf and land

in [???] [???] in [???]
more fair than thoughts of mortal men .
thus [???] softly sang [???] and then suddenly he changed . casting his
[???] cloak aside [???] he stood up and leaned no longer on his staff ; and he
spoke in a clear cold voice . ' the wise speak only of what they know [???] [???]
son of [???] . a witless worm have you become . therefore be silent [???] and
keep
your forked tongue behind your teeth . i have not passed through fire and
death to bandy crooked words with a serving - man till the lightning falls . '
he raised his staff . there was a roll of thunder . the sunlight was blotted
out from the eastern windows ; the whole hall became suddenly dark as night .
the fire faded to sullen embers . only [???] could be seen [???] standing white
and tall before the blackened hearth .
in the gloom they heard the hiss of [???] ' s voice : ' did i not
counsel you [???] lord [???] to forbid his staff ? that fool [???] [???] [???] has betrayed us ! '
there was a flash as if lightning had cloven the roof . then all was silent .
[???] [???] on his face .
' now [???] son of [???] [???] will you hearken to me ? ' said [???] . ' do
you ask for help ? ' he lifted his staff and pointed to a high window . there
the darkness seemed to clear [???] and through the opening could be seen [???] high
and far [???] a patch of shining sky . ' not all is dark . take courage [???] lord of the
mark ; for better help you will not find . no counsel have i to give to those
that despair . yet counsel i could give [???] and words i could speak to you . will
you hear them ? they are not for all ears . i bid you come out before your
doors and look abroad . too long have you sat in shadows and trusted to
twisted tales and crooked promptings . '
slowly [???] left his chair . a faint light grew in the hall again .
the woman hastened to the king ' s side [???] taking his arm [???] and with faltering
steps the old man came down from the dais and paced softly through the hall .
[???] remained lying on the floor . they came to the doors and
[???]
knocked .
' open ! ' he cried . ' the lord of the mark comes forth ! '
the doors rolled back and a keen air came whistling in . a wind was
blowing on the hill . ' send your guards down to the stairs foot [???] ' said
[???] . ' and you [???] lady [???] leave him a while with me . i will care for him . '
' go [???] [???] sister - daughter ! ' said the old king . ' the time for fear is

past . '
the woman turned and went slowly into the house . as she passed the
doors she turned and looked back . grave and thoughtful was her glance [???] as
she looked on the king with cool pity in her eyes . very fair was her face [???]
and her long hair was like a river of gold . slender and tall she was in her
white robe girt with silver ; but strong she seemed and stern as steel [???] a
daughter of kings . thus [???] for the first time in the full light of day
beheld [???] [???] lady of [???] [???] and thought her fair [???] fair and cold [???] like a
morning of pale spring that is not yet come to womanhood . and she now was
suddenly aware of him : tall heir of kings [???] wise with many winters [???]
[???] . hiding a power that yet she felt . for a moment still as stone
she stood [???] then turning swiftly she was gone .
' now [???] lord [???] ' said [???] [???] ' look out upon your land ! breathe the free
air again ! '
from the porch upon the top of the high terrace they could see beyond
the stream the green fields of [???] fading into distant grey . curtains of
wind - blown rain were [???] down . the sky above and to the west was still
dark with thunder [???] and lightning far away [???] among the tops of hidden
hills . but the wind had shifted to the north [???] and already the storm that had
come out of the east was receding [???] rolling away southward to the sea .
suddenly through a rent in the clouds behind them a shaft of sun stabbed
down . the falling showers gleamed like silver [???] and far away the river
glittered like a [???] glass .
' it is not so dark here [???] ' said [???] .
' no [???] ' said [???] . ' nor does age lie so heavily on your shoulders as
some would have you think . cast aside your prop ! '
from the king ' s hand the black staff fell [???] on the stones . he
drew himself up [???] slowly [???] as a man that is stiff from long bending over some
dull toil . now tall and straight he stood [???] and his eyes were blue as he
looked into the opening sky .
' dark have been my dreams of late [???] ' he said [???] ' but i feel as one
new - awakened . i would now that you had come before [???] [???] . for i fear that
already you have come too late [???] only to see the last days of my house . not
long now shall stand the high hall which brego son of [???] built . fire shall
devour the high seat . what is to be done ? '
' much [???] ' said [???] . ' but first send for jomer . do i not guess rightly
that you hold him prisoner [???] by the counsel of [???] [???] of him that all save

you name the [???] ? '
' it is true [???] ' said [???] . ' he had rebelled against my commands [???] and
threatened death to [???] in my hall . '
' a man may love you and yet not love [???] or his counsels ' said
[???] .
' that may be . i will do as you ask . call [???] to me . since he proved
[???] as a doorward [???] let him become an errand - runner . the guilty shall
bring the guilty to judgement [???] ' said [???] [???] and his voice was grim [???] yet he
looked at [???] and smiled and as he did so many lines of care were
smoothed away and did not return .
when [???] had been summoned and had gone [???] [???] led [???] to
a
stone seat [???] and then sat himself before the king upon the topmost stair .
[???] and his companions stood nearby .
' there is no time to tell all that you should hear [???] ' said [???] . ' yet
if my hope is not cheated [???] a time will come ere long when i can speak more
fully . behold ! you are come into a peril greater even than the wit of
[???] could weave into your dreams . but see ! you dream no longer .
you
live . [???] and [???] do not stand alone . the enemy is strong beyond our
reckoning [???] yet we have a hope at which he has not guessed . '
quickly now [???] spoke . his voice was low and secret [???] and none save
the king heard what he said . but ever as he spoke the light shone brighter
in [???] ' s eye [???] and at the last he rose from his seat to his full height [???]
and [???] beside him [???] and together they looked out from the high place
towards the east .
' verily [???] ' said [???] [???] now in a loud voice [???] keen and clear [???] ' that way
lies our hope [???] where sits our greatest fear . doom hangs still on a thread .
yet hope there is still [???] if we can but stand [???] for a little
while . '
the others too now turned their eyes eastward . over the sundering
leagues of land [???] far away they gazed to the edge of sight [???] and hope and fear
bore their thoughts still on [???] beyond dark mountains to the land of shadow .
where now was the ring - bearer ? how thin indeed was the thread upon
which
doom still hung ! it seemed to legolas [???] as he strained his [???] eyes [???]
that he caught a glint of white : far away perchance the sun [???] on a

[???] of the tower of guard . and further still [???] endlessly remote and yet
a present threat [???] there was a tiny tongue of flame .
slowly [???] sat down again [???] as if weariness still struggled to
master him against the will of [???] . he turned and looked at his great
house . ' alas ! ' he said [???] ' that these evil days should be mine [???] and should
come in my old age instead of that peace which i have earned . alas for
[???] the brave ! the young perish and the old linger [???] withering . ' he
clutched his knees with his wrinkled hands .
' your fi [???] would remember their old strength better [???] if they grasped
a sword - hilt [???] ' said [???] .
[???] rose and put his hand to his side ; but no sword hung at his
belt . ' where has [???] stowed it ? ' he muttered under his breath .
' take this [???] dear lord ! ' said a clear voice . ' it was ever at your
service . ' two men had come softly up the stair and stood now a few steps
from the top . jomer was there . no helm was on his head [???] no mail was on his
breast [???] but in his hand he held a drawn sword ; and as he knelt he offered
the hilt to his master .
' how comes this ? ' said [???] sternly . he turned towards jomer and the
men looked in wonder at him [???] standing now proud and erect . where was the
old
man whom they had left [???] in his chair or leaning on his stick ?
' it is my doing [???] lord [???] ' said [???] [???] trembling . i understood that jomer
was to be set free . such joy was in my heart that maybe i have erred . yet [???]
since he was free again [???] and he a marshal of the mark [???] ! brought him his
sword as he bade me . '
' to lay at your feet [???] my lord [???] ' said jomer .
for a moment of silence [???] stood looking down at jomer as he knelt
still before him . neither moved .
' will you not take the sword ? ' said [???] .
slowly [???] stretched forth his hand . as his fingers took the hilt [???]
it seemed to the watchers that firmness and strength returned to his thin
arm . suddenly he lifted the blade and swung it [???] and whistling in
the air . then he gave a great cry . his voice rang clear as he chanted in the
tongue of [???] a call to arms .
arise now [???] arise [???] riders of [???] !
dire deeds awake [???] dark is it eastward .
let horse be bridled [???] horn be sounded !

forth [???] !
the guards [???] thinking that they were summoned [???] sprang up the stair . they
looked at their lord in amazement [???] and then as one man they drew their
swords and laid them at his feet . ' command us ! ' they said .
' westu [???] hbl ! ' cried jomer . ' it is a joy to us to see you return
into your own . never again shall it be said [???] [???] [???] that you come only
with grief ! '
' take back your sword [???] jomer [???] sister - son ! ' said the king . ' go [???] [???] [???]
and seek my own sword ! [???] has it in his keeping . bring him to me also .
now [???] [???] [???] you said that you had counsel to give [???] if i would hear it .
what is your counsel ? '
' you have yourself already taken it [???] ' answered [???] . ' to put your
trust in jomer [???] rather than in a man of crooked mind . to cast aside regret
and fear . to do the deed at hand . every man that can ride should be sent
west at once [???] as jomer counselled you : we must first destroy the threat of
[???] [???] while we have time . if we fail [???] we fall . if we succeed - - then we
will face the next task . meanwhile your people tha t are left [???] the women and
the children and the old [???] should stay to the [???] that you have in the
mountains . were they not prepared against just such an evil day as this ? let
them take provision [???] but delay not [???] nor burden themselves with treasures [???]
great or small . it is their lives that are at stake . '
' this counsel seems good to me now [???] ' said [???] . ' let all my folk get
ready ! but you my guests - truly you said [???] [???] [???] that the courtesy of my
hall is lessened . you have ridden through the night [???] and the morning wears
away . you have had neither sleep nor food . a guest - house shall be made
ready : there you shall sleep [???] when you have eaten . '
' nay [???] lord [???] ' said [???] . ' there is no rest yet for the weary . the men
of [???] must ride forth today [???] and we will ride with them [???] axe [???] sword [???] and
bow . we did not bring them to rest against your wall [???] lord of the mark . and
i promised jomer that my sword and his should be drawn together . '
' now indeed there is hope of victory ! ' said jomer .
' hope [???] yes [???] ' said [???] . ' but [???] is strong . and other perils
draw ever nearer . do not delay [???] [???] [???] when we are gone . lead your people
swiftly to the hold of [???] in the hills ! '
' nay [???] [???] ! ' said the king . ' you do not know your own skill in
healing . it shall not be so . i myself will go to war [???] to fall in the front
of the battle [???] if it must be . thus shall i sleep better . '

' then even the defeat of [???] will be glorious in song [???] ' said [???] .
the armed men that st ood near [???] their weapons [???] crying : ' the lord of
the mark will ride ! forth [???] ! '
' but your people must not be both unarmed and shepherdless ' said
[???] . ' who shall guide them and govern them in your place ? '
' i will take thought for that ere i go [???] ' answered [???] . ' here comes
my counsellor . '
at that moment [???] came again from the hall . behind him [???]
between two other men [???] came [???] the [???] . his face was very
white .
his eyes [???] in the sunlight . [???] knelt and presented to [???] a long
sword in a [???] clasped with gold and set with green gems . ' here [???] lord [???]
is [???] [???] your ancient blade [???] ' he said . ' it was found in his chest . loth
was he to render up the keys . many other things are there which men have
missed . '
' you lie [???] ' said [???] . ' and this sword your master himself gave
into my keeping . '
' and he now requires it of you again [???] ' said [???] . ' does that
displease you ? '
' assuredly not . lord [???] ' said [???] . ' i care for you and yours as
best i may . but do not weary yourself [???] or tax too heavily your strength . let
others deal with these [???] guests . your meat is about to be set on the
board . will you not go to it ? '
' i will [???] ' said [???] . ' and let food for my guests be set on the board
beside me . the host rides today . send the heralds forth ! let them summon all
who dwell nigh ! every man and strong lad able to bear arms [???] all who have
horses [???] let them be ready in the saddle at the gate ere the second hour from
noon ! '
' dear lord ! ' cried [???] . ' it is as i feared . this [???] has
bewitched you . are none to be left to defend the golden hall of your
fathers [???] and all your treasure ? none to guard the lord of the mark ? '
' if this is bewitchment [???] ' said [???] [???] ' it seems to me more wholesome
than your whisperings . your [???] ere long would have had me walking on
all fours like a beast . no [???] not one shall be left [???] not even [???] . [???]
shall ride too . go ! you have ye t time to clean the rust from your sword . '
' mercy [???] lord ! ' whined [???] [???] grovelling on the ground . ' have pity
on one worn out in your service . send me not from your side ! i at least will

stand by you when all others have gone . do not send your faithful [???]
away ! '
' you have my pity [???] ' said [???] . ' and i do not send you from my side .
i go myself to war with my men . i bid you come with me and prove your
faith . '
[???] looked from face to face . in his eyes was the hunted look of
a beast seeking some gap in the ring of his enemies . he licked his lips with
a long pale tongue . ' such a resolve might be expected from a lord of the
house of [???] [???] old though he be [???] ' he said . ' but those who truly love him
would spare his failing years . yet i see that i come too late . others [???] whom
the death of my lord would perhaps grieve less [???] have already persuaded him .
if i cannot undo their work [???] hear me at least in this [???] lord ! one who knows
your mind and honours your commands shou ld be left in [???] . appoint a
faithful steward . let your counsellor [???] keep all things till your
return - and i pray that we may see it [???] though no wise man will deem it
hopeful . '
jomer laughed . ' and if that plea does not excuse you from war [???] most
noble [???] [???] ' he said [???] what office of less honour would you accept ? to
carry a sack of meal up into the mountains - if any man would trust you with
it ? '
' nay [???] jomer [???] you do not fully understand the mind of master
[???] [???] ' said [???] [???] turning his piercing glance upon him . ' he is bold
and cunning . even now he plays a game with peril and wins a throw . hours of
my precious time he has wasted already . ' down snake ! ' he said suddenly in a
terrible voice . ' down on your belly ! how long is it since [???] bought
you ? what was the promised price ? when all the men were dead [???] you were to
pick your share of the treasure [???] and take the woman you desire ? too long
have you watched her under your eyelids and haunted her steps . '
jomer grasped his sword . ' that i knew already [???] ' he muttered . ' for that
reason i would have slain him before [???] forgetting the law of the hall . but
there are other reasons . ' he stepped forward [???] but [???] stayed him with
his hand .
' [???] is safe now [???] ' he said . ' but you [???] [???] [???] you have done what
you could for your true master . some reward you have earned at least . yet
[???] is apt to overlook his bargains . i should advise you to go quickly
and remind him [???] lest he forget your faithful service . '
' you lie [???] ' said [???] .

' that word comes too oft and easy from your lips [???] ' said [???] . ' i do
not lie . see [???] [???] [???] here is a snake ! with safety you cannot take it with
you [???] nor can you leave it behind . to slay it would be just . but it was not
always as it now is . once it was a man [???] and did you service in its fashion .
give him a horse and let him go at once [???] wherever he chooses . by his choice
you shall judge him . '
' do you hear this [???] [???] ? ' said [???] . ' this is your choice : to
ride with me to war [???] and let us see in battle whether you are true ; or to go
now [???] whither you will . but then [???] if ever we meet again [???] i shall not be
merciful . '
slowly [???] rose . he looked at them with half - closed eyes . last
of all he [???] [???] ' s face and opened his mouth as if to speak . then
suddenly he drew himself up . his hands worked . his eyes glittered . such
malice was in them that men stepped back from him . he bared his teeth ; and
then with a hissing breath he spat before the king ' s feet [???] and darting to
one side [???] he fled down the stair .
' after him ! ' said [???] . ' see that he does no harm to any [???] but do not
hurt him or hinder him . give him a horse [???] if he wishes it . '
' and if any will bear him [???] ' said jomer .
one of the guards ran down the stair . another went to the well at the
foot of the terrace and in his helm drew water . with it he washed clean the
stones that [???] had defiled .
' now my guests [???] come ! ' said [???] . ' come and take such refreshment as
haste allows . '
they passed back into the great house . already they heard below them in
the town the heralds crying and the war - horns blowing . for the king was to
ride forth as soon as the men of the town and those dwelling near could be
armed and assembled .
at the king ' s board sat jomer and the four guests [???] and there also
waiting upon the king was the lady [???] . they ate and drank swiftly . the
others were silent while [???] questioned [???] concerning [???] .
' how far back his treachery goes [???] who can guess ? ' said [???] . ' he was
not always evil . once i do not doubt that he was the friend of [???] ; and
even when his heart grew colder [???] he found you useful still . but for long now
he has plotted your ruin [???] wearing the mask of friendship [???] until he was
ready . in those years [???] ' s task was easy [???] and all that you did was
swiftly known in [???] ; for your land was open [???] and strangers came and

went . and ever [???] ' s whispering was in your ears [???] poisoning your
thought [???] chilling your heart [???] weakening your limbs [???] while others watched and
could do nothing [???] for your will was in his keeping .
' but when i escaped and warned you [???] then the mask was torn [???] for those
who would see . after that [???] played dangerously [???] always seeking
to
delay you [???] to prevent your full strength being gathered . he was crafty :
dulling men ' s wariness [???] or working on their fears [???] as served the occasion .
do you not remember how eagerly he urged that no man should be spared on
a
[???] chase northward [???] when the immediate peril was westward ? he
persuaded you to forbid jomer to pursue the raiding [???] . if jomer had not
defied [???] ' s voice speaking with your mouth [???] those [???] would
have
reached [???] by now [???] bearing a great prize . not indeed that prize which
[???] desires above all else [???] but at the least two members of my company [???]
sharers of a secret hope [???] of which even to you [???] lord [???] i cannot yet speak
openly . dare you think of what they might now be suffering [???] or what [???]
might now have learned to our destruction ? '
' i owe much to jomer [???] ' said [???] . ' faithful heart may have forward
tongue . ' ' say also [???] ' said [???] [???] ' that to crooked eyes truth may wear a
wry face . '
' indeed my eyes were almost blind [???] ' said [???] . ' most of all i owe to
you [???] my guest . once again you have come in time . i would give you a gift ere
we go [???] at your own choosing . you have only to name aught that is mine . i
reserve now only my sword ! '
' whether i came in time or not is yet to be seen [???] ' said [???] . ' but
as for your gift [???] lord [???] i will choose one that will fit my need : swift and
sure . give me [???] ! he was only lent before [???] if loan we may call it .
but now shall ride him into great hazard [???] setting silver against black : i
would not risk anything that is not my own . and already there is a bond of
love between us . '
' you choose well [???] ' said [???] ; ' and i give him now gladly . yet it is
a great gift . there is none like to [???] . in him one of the mighty
steeds of old has returned . none such shall return again . and to you my
other guests i will offer such things as may be found in my armoury . swords
you do not need [???] but there are helms and coats of mail of cunning work [???]

gifts to my fathers out of [???] . choose from these ere we go [???] and may they
serve you well ! '
now men came bearing raiment of war from the king ' s hoard and they
arrayed [???] and legolas in shining mail . helms too they chose [???] and round
shields : their bosses were [???] with gold and set with gems [???] green and
red and white . [???] took no armour ; and [???] needed no coat of rings [???]
even if one had been found to match his stature [???] for there was no [???] in
the hoards of [???] of better make than his short [???] forged beneath
the mountain in the north . but he chose a cap of iron and leather that
fitted well upon his round head ; and a small shield he also took . it bore
the running horse [???] white upon green [???] that was the [???] of the house of
[???] .
' may it keep you well ! ' said [???] . ' it was made for me in [???] ' s
day [???] while still i was a boy . '
[???] bowed . ' i am proud [???] lord of the mark [???] to bear your device [???] ' he
said . ' indeed sooner would i bear a horse than be borne by one . i love my
feet better . but [???] maybe [???] i shall come yet where i can stand and fight . '
' it may well be so [???] ' said [???] .
the king now rose [???] and at once [???] came forward bearing wine . ' [???]
[???] hbl ! ' she said . ' receive now this cup and drink in happy hour .
health be with thee at thy going and coming ! '
[???] drank from the cup [???] and she then proffered it to the guests . as
she stood before [???] she paused suddenly and looked upon him [???] and her
eyes were shining . and he looked down upon her fair face and smiled ; but as
he took the cup [???] his hand met hers [???] and he knew that she trembled at the
touch . ' hail [???] son of [???] ! ' she said . ' hail lady of [???] ! ' he
answered [???] but his face now was troubled and he did not smile .
when they had all drunk [???] the king went down the hall to the doors .
there the guards [???] him [???] and heralds stood [???] and all the lords and
chiefs were gathered together that remained in [???] or dwelt nearby .
' behold ! i go forth [???] and it seems like to be my last riding [???] ' said
[???] . ' i have no child . [???] my son is slain . i name jomer my
sister - son to be my heir . if neither of us return [???] then choose a new lord as
you will . but to some one i must now entrust my people that i leave behind [???]
to rule them in my place . which of you will stay ? '
no man spoke .
' is there none whom you would name ? in whom do my people trust ? '

' in the house of [???] [???] ' answered [???] .
' but jomer i cannot spare [???] nor would he stay [???] ' said the king ; ' and he
is the last of that house . '
' i said not jomer [???] ' answered [???] . ' and he is not the last . there is
[???] [???] daughter of jomund [???] his sister . she is fearless and high - hearted . all
love her . let her be as lord to the [???] [???] while we are gone . '
' it shall be so [???] ' said [???] . ' let the heralds announce to the folk
that the lady [???] will lead them ! '
then the king sat upon a seat before his doors [???] and [???] knelt before
him and received from him a sword and a fair [???] . ' farewell
sister - daughter ! ' he said . ' dark is the hour [???] yet maybe we shall return to
the golden hall . but in [???] the people may long defend themselves [???]
and
if the battle go ill [???] thither will come all who escape . ' ' speak not so ! ' she
answered . ' a year shall i endure for every day that passes until your
return . ' but as she spoke her eyes went to [???] who stood nearby .
' the king shall come again [???] ' he said . ' fear not ! not west but east does
our doom [???] us . '
the king now went down the stair with [???] beside him . the others
followed . [???] looked back as they passed towards the gate . alone [???]
stood before the doors of the house at the stair ' s head ; the sword was set
upright before her [???] and her hands were laid upon the hilt . she was clad now
in mail and shone like silver in the sun .
[???] walked with legolas . his axe on his shoulder . ' well [???] at last we
set off ! ' he said . ' men need many words before deeds . my axe is restless in
my hands . though i doubt not that these [???] are fell - handed when they
come to it . nonetheless this is not the [???] that suits me . how shall i
come to the battle ? i wish i could walk and not bump like a sack at
[???] ' s [???] . '
' a safer seat than many [???] i guess [???] ' said legolas . ' yet doubtless [???]
will gladly put you down on your feet when blows begin ; or [???]
himself . an axe is no weapon for a rider . '
' and a dwarf is no horseman . it is orc - necks i would hew [???] not shave the
scalps of men [???] ' said [???] [???] patting the haft of his axe .
at the gate they found a great host of men [???] old and young [???] all ready in
the saddle . more than a thousand were there mustered . their spears were like
a springing wood . loudly and joyously they shouted as [???] came forth .

some held in readiness the king ' s horse [???] [???] [???] and others held the
horses of [???] and legolas . [???] stood ill at ease [???] frowning [???] bu t jomer
came up to him [???] leading his horse .
' hail [???] [???] [???] ' s son ! ' he cried . ' i have not had time to learn
gentle speech under your rod [???] as you promised . but shall we not put aside
our quarrel ? at least i will speak no evil again of the lady of the wood . '
' i will forget my wrath for a while [???] jomer son of jomund [???] ' said [???] ;
' but if ever you chance to see the lady [???] with your eyes [???] then you
shall acknowledge her the fairest of ladies [???] or our friendship will end . '
' so be it ! ' said jomer . ' but until that time pardon me [???] and in token of
pardon ride with me [???] i beg . [???] will be at the head with the lord of the
mark ; but firefoot [???] my horse [???] will bear us both [???] if you will . '
' i thank you indeed [???] ' said [???] greatly pleased . ' i will gladly go
with you [???] if legolas [???] my comrade [???] may ride beside us . '
' it shall he so [???] ' said jomer . ' legolas upon my left [???] and [???] upon
my right [???] and none will dare to stand before us ! '
' where is [???] ? ' said [???] .
' running wild over the grass [???] ' they answered . ' he will let no man
handle him . there he goes [???] away down by the ford [???] like a shadow among the
willows . '
[???] whistled and called aloud the horse ' s name [???] and far away he
tossed his head and neighed [???] and turning sped towards the host like an
arrow .
' were the breath of the west wind to take a body visible [???] even so would
it appear [???] ' said jomer [???] as the great horse ran up [???] until he stood before the
[???] .
' the gift seems already to be given [???] ' said [???] . ' but hearken all !
here now i name my guest [???] [???] [???] [???] wisest of counsellors ; most
welcome of wanderers [???] a lord of the mark [???] a chieftain of the [???] while
our kin shall last ; and i give to him [???] [???] prince of horses . '
' i thank you [???] [???] king [???] ' said [???] . then suddenly he threw back
his grey cloak [???] and cast aside his hat [???] and leaped to [???] . he wore no
helm nor mail . his snowy hair flew free in the wind [???] his white robes shone
[???] in the sun .
' behold the white rider ! ' cried [???] [???] and all took up the words .
' our king and the white rider ! ' they shouted . ' forth [???] ! '
the trumpets sounded . the horses reared and neighed . spear [???] on

shield . then the king raised his hand [???] and with a rush like the sudden onset
of a great wind the last host of [???] rode thundering into the west . far
over the plain [???] saw the glitter of their spears [???] as she stood still [???]
alone before the doors of the silent house .




chapter 7 . helm ' s deep



the sun was already westering as they rode from [???] [???] and the light
of it was in their eyes [???] turning all the rolling fields of [???] to a golden
haze . there was a beaten way [???] north - westward along the foot - hills of the
white mountains [???] and this they followed [???] up and down in a green country [???]
crossing small swift streams by many fords . far ahead and to their right the
misty mountains loomed ; ever darker and taller they grew as the miles went
by . the sun went slowly down before them . evening came behind .
the host rode on . need drove them . fearing to come too late [???] they rode
with all the speed they could [???] [???] seldom . swift and enduring were the
steeds of [???] [???] but there were many leagues to go . forty leagues and more
it was [???] as a bird flies [???] from [???] to the fords of the isen [???] where they
hoped to find the king ' s men that held back the hosts of [???] .
night closed about them . at last they halted to make their camp . they
had ridden for some five hours and were far out upon the western plain [???] yet
more than half their journey lay still before them . in a great circle [???] under
the starry sky and the waxing moon [???] they now made their [???] . they lit no
fires [???] for they were uncertain of events ; but they set a ring of mounted
guards about them [???] and scouts rode out far ahead [???] passing like shadows in
the folds of the land . the slow night passed without tidings or alarm . at
dawn the horns sounded [???] and within an hour they took the road again .
there were no clouds overhead yet [???] but a heaviness was in the air ; it
was hot for the season of the year . the rising sun was hazy [???] and behind it [???]
following it slowly up the sky [???] there was a growing darkness [???] as of a great
storm moving out of the east . and away in the north - west there seemed to be
another darkness brooding about the feet of the misty mountains [???] a shadow
that crept down slowly from the [???] ' s vale .
[???] dropped back to where legolas rode beside jomer . ' you have the
keen eyes of your fair kindred [???] legolas [???] ' he said ; ' and they can tell a
sparrow from a finch a league off . tell me [???] can you sec anything away yonder
towards [???] ? '
' many miles lie between [???] ' said legolas [???] gazing thither and shading his
eyes with his long hand . ' i can see a darkness . there are shapes moving in
it [???] great shapes far away upon the bank of the river ; but what they are i

cannot tell . it is not mist or cloud that defeats my eyes : there is a
veiling shadow that some power lays upon the land [???] and it marches slowly
down stream . it is as if the [???] under endless trees were flowing
downwards from the hills . '
' and behind us comes a very storm of [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' it will be
a black night . '
as the second day of their riding drew on [???] the heaviness in the air
increased . in the afternoon the dark clouds began to overtake them : a [???]
canopy with great [???] edges flecked with [???] light . the sun went
down [???] blood - red in a smoking haze . the spears of the riders were tipped with
fire as the last shafts of light kindled the steep faces of the peaks of
[???] : now very near they stood on the northernmost arm of the white
mountains [???] three jagged horns staring at the sunset . in the last red glow
men in the [???] saw a black speck [???] a horseman riding back towards them .
they halted [???] him .
he came [???] a weary man with dinted helm and cloven shield . slowly he
climbed from his horse and stood there a while gasping . at length he spoke .
' is jomer here ? ' he asked . ' you come at last [???] but too late [???] and with too
little strength . things have gone evilly since [???] fell . we were driven
back yesterday over the isen with great loss ; many perished at the crossing .
then at night fresh forces came over the river against our camp . all
[???] must be emptied ; and [???] has armed the wild hillmen and
herd - folk of dunland beyond the rivers [???] and these also he loosed upon us . we
were [???] . the shield - wall was broken . [???] of westfold has
drawn off those men he could gather towards his fastness in helm ' s deep . the
rest are scattered .
' where is jomer ? tell him there is no hope ahead . he should return to
[???] before the wolves of [???] come there . ' [???] had sat silent [???]
hidden from the man ' s sight behind his guards ; now he urged his horse
forward . ' come [???] stand before me [???] [???] ! ' he said . ' i am here . the last host
of the [???] has ridden forth . it will not return without battle . '
the man ' s face lightened with joy and wonder . he drew himself up . then
he knelt [???] offering his notched sword to the king . ' command me [???] lord ! ' he
cried . ' and pardon me ! i thought - - '
' you thought i remained in [???] bent like an old tree under winter
snow . so it was when you rode to war . but a west wind has shaken the
boughs [???] ' said [???] . ' give this man a fresh horse ! let us ride to the help

of [???] ! '
while [???] was speaking [???] [???] rode a short way ahead [???] and he sat
there alone [???] gazing north to [???] and west to the setting sun . now he
came back .
' ride [???] [???] ! ' he said . ' ride to helm ' s deep ! go not to the fords of
isen [???] and do not tarry in the plain ! i must leave you for a while . [???]
must bear me now on a swift errand . ' turning to [???] and jomer and the
men of the king ' s household [???] he cried : ' keep well the lord of the mark [???] till
i return . [???] me at helm ' s gate ! farewell ! '
he spoke a word to [???] [???] and like an arrow from the bow the gr eat
horse sprang away . even as they looked he was gone : a flash of silver in the
sunset [???] a wind over the grass [???] a shadow that fled and passed from sight .
[???] snorted and reared [???] eager to follow ; but only a swift bird on the
wing could have overtaken him .
' what does that mean ? ' said one of the guard to [???] .
' that [???] [???] has need of haste [???] ' answered [???] . ' ever he goes
and comes [???] - for : '
' [???] [???] were he here [???] would not find it hard to explain ' said the
other .
' true enough [???] ' said [???] ; ' but for myself [???] i will wait until i see
[???] again . '
' maybe you will wait long [???] ' said the other .
the host turned away now from the road to the fords of isen and bent
their course southward . night fell [???] a nd still they rode on . the hills drew
near [???] but the tall peaks of [???] were already dim against the darkening
sky . still some miles away [???] on the far side of the westfold vale [???] lay a
green coomb [???] a great bay in the mountains [???] out of which a gorge opened in
the hills . men of that land called it helm ' s deep [???] after a hero of old wars
who had made his [???] there . ever steeper and narrower it wound inward
from the north under the shadow of the [???] [???] till the crow - haunted
cliffs rose like mighty towers on either side [???] shutting out the light .
at helm ' s gate [???] before the mouth of the deep [???] there was a heel of rock
thrust outward by the northern cliff . there upon its spur stood high walls
of ancient stone [???] and within them was a lofty tower . men said that in the
far - off days of the glory of [???] the sea - kings had built here this
fastness with the hands of giants . the [???] it was called [???] for a trumpet
sounded upon the tower echoed in the deep behind [???] as i f armies

long - forgotten were issuing to war from caves beneath the hills . a wall [???]
too [???] the men of old had made from the [???] to the southern cliff [???]
barring the entrance to the gorge . beneath it by a wide [???] the
deeping - stream passed out . about the feet of the [???] it wound [???] and
flowed then in a gully through the midst of a wide green gore [???] [???]
gently down from helm ' s gate to helm ' s dike . thence it fell into the
deeping - coomb and out into the westfold vale . there in the [???] at
helm ' s gate [???] [???] master of westfold on the borders of the mark [???] now
dwelt . as the days darkened with threat of war [???] being wise [???] he had repaired
the wall and made the fastness strong .
the riders were still in the low valley before the mouth of the coomb [???]
when cries and [???] were heard from their scouts that went in front .
out of the darkness arrows whistled . swiftly a scout rode back and reported
that wolf - riders were abroad in the valley [???] and tha t a host of [???] and wild
men were hurrying southward from the fords of isen and seemed to be
making
for helm ' s deep .
' we have found many of our folk lying slain as they fled thither [???] ' said
the scout . ' and we have met scattered companies [???] going this way and that [???]
leaderless . what has become of [???] none seem to know . it is likely
that he will be overtaken ere he can reach helm ' s gate [???] if he has not
already perished . '
' has aught been seen of [???] ? ' asked [???] .
' yes [???] lord . many have seen an old man in white upon a horse [???] passing
hither and thither over the plains like wind in the grass . some thought he
was [???] . it is said that he went away ere nightfall towards [???] .
some say also that [???] was seen earlier [???] going northward with a
company of [???] . '
' it will go ill with [???] [???] if [???] comes upon him said
[???] . ' nonetheless i miss now both my counsellors [???] the old and the new .
but in this need we have no better choice than to go on [???] as [???] said [???] to
helm ' s gate [???] whether [???] be there or no . is it known how great is the
host that comes from the north ? '
' it is very great [???] ' said the scout . ' he that flies counts every foeman
twice [???] yet i have spoken to [???] men [???] and i do not doubt that the
main strength of the enemy is many times as great as all that we have here . '
' then let us be swift [???] ' said jomer . ' let us drive through such foes as

are already between us and the fastness . there are caves in helm ' s deep
where hundreds may lie hid ; and secret ways lead thence up on to the hills .
' trust not to secret ways [???] ' said the king . ' [???] has long spied out
this land . still in that place our defence may last long . let us go ! '
[???] and legolas went now with jomer in the van . on through the dark
night they rode [???] ever slower as the darkness deepened and their way climbed
southward [???] higher and higher into the dim folds about the mountains ' feet .
they found few of the enemy before them . here and there they came upon
roving bands of [???] ; but they fled ere the riders could take or slay them .
' it will not be long i fear [???] ' said jomer [???] ' ere the coming of the king ' s
host will be known to the leader of our enemies [???] [???] or whatever captain
he has sent forth . '
the rumour of war grew behind them . now they could hear [???] borne over the
dark [???] the sound of harsh singing . they had climbed far up into the
deeping - coomb when they looked back . then they saw torches countless
points
of fiery light upon the black fields behind [???] scattered like red flowers [???] or
winding up from the [???] in long [???] lines . here and there a
larger blaze leapt up .
' it is a great host and follows us hard [???] ' said [???] .
' they br ing fire [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and they are burning as they come [???]
rick [???] cot [???] and tree . this was a rich vale and had many [???] . alas for
my folk ! '
' would that day was here and we might ride down upon them like a storm
out of the mountains ! ' said [???] . ' it grieves me to fly before them . '
' we need not fly much further [???] ' said jomer . ' not far ahead now lies
helm ' s dike [???] an ancient trench and rampart scored across the coomb [???] two
[???] below helm ' s gate . there we can turn and give ba ttle . '
' nay [???] we are too few to defend the dike [???] ' said [???] . ' it is a mile
long or more [???] and the breach in it is wide . '
' at the breach our [???] must stand [???] if we are pressed [???] ' said
jomer .
there was neither star nor moon when the riders came to the breach in
the dike [???] where the stream from above passed out [???] and the road beside it ran
down from the [???] . the rampart loomed suddenly before them [???] a high
shadow beyond a dark pit . as they rode up a [???] challenged them .
' the lord of the mark rides to helm ' s gate [???] ' jomer answered . ' i [???] jomer

son of jomund [???] speak . '
' this is good tidings beyond hope [???] ' said the [???] . ' hasten ! the
enemy is on your heels . '
the host passed through the breach and halted on the [???] sward
above . they now learned to their joy that [???] had left many men to
hold helm ' s gate [???] and more had since escaped thither .
' maybe [???] we have a thousand fit to fight on foot [???] ' said gamling [???] an old
man [???] the leader of those that watched the dike . ' but most of them have seen
too many winters [???] as i have [???] or too few [???] as my son ' s son here . what news of
[???] ? word came yesterday that he was retreating hither with all that
is left of the best riders of westfold . but he has not come . '
' i fear that he will not come now [???] ' said jomer . ' our scouts have gained
no news of him [???] and the enemy fills all the valley behind us . '
' i would that he had escaped [???] ' said [???] . ' he was a mighty man . in
him lived again the valour of helm the hammerhand . but we cannot [???]
him
here . we must draw all our forces now behind the walls . are you well stored ?
we bring little provision [???] for we rode forth to open battle [???] not to a
siege . '
' behind us in the caves of the deep are three parts of the folk of
westfold [???] old and young [???] children and women [???] ' said gamling . ' but great store
of food [???] and many beasts and their [???] [???] have also been gathered there . '
' that is well [???] ' said jomer . ' they are burning or [???] all that is
left in the vale . '
' if they come to bargain for our goods at helm ' s gate [???] they will pay a
high price [???] ' said gamling .
the king and his riders passed on . before the causeway that crossed the
stream they [???] . in a long file they led their horses up the ramp and
passed within the gates of the [???] . there they were welcomed again with
joy and renewed hope ; for now there were men enough to man both the burg
and
the barrier wall .
quickly jomer set his men in readiness . the king and the men of his
household were in the [???] [???] and there also were many of the
westfold - men . but on the deeping wall and its tower [???] and behind it [???] jomer
arrayed most of the strength that he had [???] for here the defence seemed more
doubtful [???] if the assault were determined and in great force . the horses were

led far up the deep under such guard as could be spared .
the deeping wall was twenty feet high [???] and so thick that four men could
walk [???] along the top [???] sheltered by a [???] over which only a tall
man could look . here and there were [???] in the stone through which men
could shoot . this battlement could be reached by a stair running down from a
door in the outer court of the [???] ; three flights of steps led also up
on to the wall from the deep behind ; but in front it was smooth [???] and the
great stones of it were set with such skill that no foothold could be found
at their joints [???] and at the top they hung over like a sea - delved cliff .
[???] stood leaning against the breastwork upon the wall . legolas sat
above on the [???] [???] fingering his bow [???] and peering out into the gloom .
' this is more to my liking [???] ' said the dwarf [???] stamping on the stones .
' ever my heart rises as we draw near the mountains . there is good rock here .
this country has tough bones . i felt them in my feet as we came up from the
dike . give me a year and a hundred of my kin and i would make this a place
that armies would break upon like water . '
' i do not doubt it [???] ' said legolas . ' but you are a dwarf [???] and [???]
are strange folk . i do not like this place [???] and i shall like it no more by
the light of day . but you comfort me [???] [???] [???] and i am glad to have you
standing nigh with your stout legs and your hard axe . i wish there were more
of your kin among us . but even more would i give for a hundred good archers
of [???] . we shall need them . the [???] have good bowmen after
their
fashion [???] but there are too few here [???] too few . '
' it is dark for archery [???] ' said [???] . ' indeed it is time for sleep .
sleep ! i feel the need of it [???] as never i thought any dwarf could . riding is
tiring work . yet my axe is restless in my hand . give me a row of orc - necks
and room to swing and all weariness will fall from me ! '
a slow time passed . far down in the valley scattered fires still
burned . the hosts of [???] were advancing in silence now . their torches
could be seen winding up the coomb in many lines .
suddenly from the dike yells and screams [???] and the fierce battle - cries
of men broke out . flaming brands appeared over the brink and [???]
thickly at the breach . then they scattered and vanished . men came [???]
back over the field and up the ramp to the gate of the [???] . the
[???] of the [???] had been driven in .
' the enemy is at hand ! ' they said . ' we loosed every arrow that we had [???]

and filled the dike with [???] . but it will not halt them long . already they
are scaling the bank at many points [???] thick as marching ants . but we have
taught them not to carry torches . '
it was now past midnight . the sky was utterly dark [???] and the stillness
of the heavy air [???] storm . suddenly the clouds were seared by a
blinding flash . branched lightning smote down upon the eastward hills . for a
staring moment the watchers on the walls saw all the space between them and
the dike lit with white light : it was boiling and [???] with black
shapes . some squat and broad [???] some tall and grim [???] with high helms and sable
shields . hundreds and hundreds more were pouring over the dike and through
the breach . the dark tide flowed up to the walls from cliff to cliff .
thunder rolled in the valley . rain came [???] down .
arrows thick as the rain came whistling over the battlements [???] and fell
clinking and glancing on the stones . some found a mark . the assault on
helm ' s deep had begun [???] but no sound or challenge was heard within ; no
answering arrows came .
the assailing hosts halted [???] foiled by the silent menace of rock and
wall . ever and again the lightning tore aside the darkness . then the [???]
screamed [???] waving spear and sword [???] and shooting a cloud of arrows at any that
stood revealed upon the battlements ; and the men of the mark amazed looked
out [???] as it seemed to them [???] upon a great field of dark corn [???] tossed by a
tempest of war [???] and every ear glinted with barbed light .
brazen trumpets sounded . the enemy surged forward [???] some against the
deeping wall [???] other towards the causeway a nd the ramp that led up to the
[???] - gates . there the hugest [???] were mustered [???] and the wild men of the
dunland fells . a moment they [???] and then on they came . the lightning
flashed [???] and blazoned upon every helm and shield the ghastly hand of
[???] was seen : they reached the summit of the rock ; they drove towards
the gates .
then at last an answer came : a storm of arrows met them [???] and a hail of
stones . they wavered [???] broke [???] and fled back ; and then charged again [???] broke
and charged again ; and each time [???] like the [???] sea [???] they halted at a
higher point . again trumpets rang [???] and a press of roaring men leaped forth .
they held their great shields above them like a roof [???] while in their midst
they bore two trunks of mighty trees . behind them orc - archers crowded [???]
sending a hail of darts against the bowmen on the walls . they gained the
gates . the trees [???] swung by strong arms [???] smote the timbers with a rending

boom . if any man fell [???] crushed by a stone hurtling from above [???] two others
sprang to take his place . again and again the great rams swung and [???] .
jomer and [???] stood together on the deeping wall . they heard the
roar of voices and the [???] of the rams ; and then in a sudden flash of
light they beheld the peril of the gates .
' come ! ' said [???] . ' this is the hour when we draw swords together ! '
running like fire [???] they sped along the wall [???] and up the steps [???] and
passed into the outer court upon the rock . as they ran they gathered a
handful of stout swordsmen . there was a small postern - door that opened in an
angle of the burg - wall on the west [???] where the cliff stretched out to meet
it . on that side a narrow path ran round towards the great gate [???] between the
wall and the sheer brink of the rock . together jomer and [???] sprang
through the door [???] their men close behind . the swords flashed from the sheath
as one .
' g [???] [???] ! ' cried jomer . ' g [???] [???] for the mark ! '
' and [???] ril ! ' cried [???] . ' and [???] ril for the d [???] nedain ! '
charging from the side [???] they hurled themselves upon the wild men .
and [???] ril rose and fell [???] gleaming with white fire . a shout went up from wall
and tower : ' and [???] ril ! and [???] ril goes to war . the blade that was broken shines
again ! '
dismayed the [???] let fall the trees and turned to fight ; but the
wall of their shields was broken as by a lightning - stroke [???] and they were
swept away [???] hewn down [???] or cast over the rock into the stony stream below .
the orc - archers shot wildly and then fled .
for a moment jomer and [???] halted before the gates . the thunder was
rumbling in the distance now . the lightning [???] still [???] far off among
the mountains in the south . a keen wind was blowing from the north again .
the clouds were torn and drifting [???] and stars peeped out ; and above the hills
of the coomb - side the westering moon rode [???] [???] yellow in the
storm - wrack .
' we did not come too soon [???] ' said [???] [???] looking at the gates . their
great [???] and iron bars were wrenched and bent ; many of their timbers
were cracked .
' yet we cannot stay here beyond the walls to defend them [???] ' said jomer .
' look ! ' he pointed to the causeway . already a great press of [???] and men
were gathering again beyond the stream . arrows whined [???] and skipped on the
stones about them . ' come ! we must get back and see what we can do to pile

stone and beam across the gates within . come now ! '
they turned and ran . at that moment some dozen [???] that had lain
motionless among the slain leaped to their feet [???] and came silently and
swiftly behind . two flung themselves to the ground at jomer ' s heels [???] tripped
him [???] and in a moment they were on top of him . but a small dark figure that
none had observed sprang out of the shadows and gave a hoarse shout : [???]
[???] ! [???] ai - [???] ! an axe swung and swept back . two [???] fell
headless .
the rest fled .
jomer struggled to his feet [???] even as [???] ran back to his aid .
the postern was closed again [???] the iron door was barred and piled inside
with stones . when all were safe within [???] jomer turned : ' i thank you [???] [???]
son of [???] ! ' he said . ' i did not know that you were with us in the sortie .
but oft the [???] guest proves the best company . how came you there ? '
' i followed you to shake off sleep [???] ' said [???] ; ' but i looked on the
hillmen and they seemed over large for me [???] so i sat beside a stone to see
your sword - play . '
' i shall not find it easy to repay you [???] ' said jomer .
' there may be many a chance ere the night is over [???] ' laughed the dwarf .
' but i am content . till now i have hewn naught but wood since i left moria . '
' two ! ' said [???] [???] patting his axe . he had returned to his place on the
wall .
' two ? ' said legolas . ' i have done better [???] though now i must grope for
spent arrows ; all mine are gone . yet i make my tale twenty at the least . but
that is only a few leaves in a forest . '
the sky now was quickly clearing and the sinking moon was shining
brightly . but the light brought little hope to the riders of the mark . the
enemy before them seemed to have grown rather than diminished [???] still more
were pressing up from the valley through the breach . the sortie upon the
rock gained only a brief respite . the assault on the gates was [???] .
against the deeping wall the hosts of [???] roared like a sea . [???] and
hillmen swarmed about its feet from end to end . ropes with [???] hooks
were hurled over the [???] faster than men could cut them or fling them
back . hundreds of long ladders were lifted up . many were cast down in ruin [???]
but many more replaced them [???] and [???] sprang up them like apes in the dark
forests of the south . before the wall ' s foot the dead and broken were piled
like [???] in a storm ; ever higher rose the hideous mounds [???] and still the

enemy came on .
the men of [???] grew weary . all their arrows were spent [???] and every
shaft was shot ; their swords were notched [???] and their shields were riven .
three times [???] and jomer [???] them [???] and three times and [???] ril flamed
in a desperate charge that drove the enemy from the wall .
then a clamour arose in the deep behind . [???] had crept like rats
through the [???] through which the stream flowed out . there they had
gathered in the shadow of the cliffs [???] until the assault above was [???]
and nearly all the men of the defence had rushed to the wall ' s top . then
they sprang out . already some had passed into the jaws of the deep and were
among the horses [???] fighting with the guards .
down from the wall leapt [???] with a fierce cry that echoed in the
cliffs . ' [???] ! [???] ! ' he soon had work enough .
' ai - oi ! ' he shouted . ' the [???] are behind the wall . ai - oi ! come [???]
legolas ! there are enough for us both . [???] ai - [???] ! '
gamling the old looked down from the [???] [???] hearing the great voice
of the dwarf above all the tumult . ' the [???] are in the deep ! ' he cried .
' helm ! helm ! forth [???] . he shouted as he leaped down the stair from
the rock with many men of westfold at his back .
their onset was fierce and sudden [???] and the [???] gave way before them .
ere long they were hemmed in in the narrows of the gorge [???] and all were slain
or driven shrieking into the chasm of the deep to fall before the guardians
of the hidden caves .
' twenty - one ! ' cried [???] . he hewed a two - handed stroke and laid the
last orc before his feet . ' now my count passes master legolas again . '
' we must stop this rat - hole [???] ' said gamling . ' [???] are said to be
cunning folk with stone . lend us your aid [???] master ! '
' we do not shape stone with battle - axes [???] nor with our finger - nails [???] '
said [???] . ' but i will help as i may . '
they gathered such small [???] and broken stones as they could find
to hand [???] and under [???] ' s direction the westfold - men blocked up the inner
end of the [???] [???] until only a narrow outlet remained . then the
deeping - stream [???] [???] by the rain [???] churned and fretted in its choked path [???]
and spread slowly in cold [???] from cliff to cliff .
' it will be drier above [???] ' said [???] . ' come [???] gamling [???] let us see how
things go on the wall ! '
he climbed up and found legolas beside [???] and jomer . the elf was

whetting his long knife . there was for a while a lull in the assault [???] since
the attempt to break in through the [???] had been foiled .
' twenty - one ! ' said [???] .
' good ! ' said legolas . ' but my count is now two dozen . it has been
knife - work up here . '
jomer and [???] leant wearily on their swo rds . away on the left the
crash and clamour of the battle on the rock rose loud again . but the
[???] still held fast [???] like an island in the sea . its gates lay in ruin ;
but over the [???] of beams and stones within no enemy as yet had
passed .
[???] looked at the pale stars [???] and at the moon [???] now [???] behind
the western hills that enclosed the valley . ' this is a night as long as
years [???] ' he said . ' how long will the day tarry ? '
' dawn is not far off [???] ' said gamling [???] who had now climbed up beside him .
' but dawn will not help us [???] i fear . '
' yet dawn is ever the hope of men [???] ' said [???] .
' but these creatures of [???] [???] these half - [???] and [???] - men that
the foul craft of [???] has bred [???] they will not quail at the sun [???] ' said
gamling . ' and neither will the wild men of the hills . do you not hear their
voices ? '
' i hear them [???] ' said jomer ; ' but they are only the scream of birds and
the [???] of beasts to my ears . '
' yet there are many that cry in the dunland tongue [???] ' said gamling . ' i
know that tongue . it is an ancient speech of men [???] and once was spoken in
many western [???] of the mark . hark ! they hate us [???] and they are glad ; for
our doom seems certain to them . ' the king the king ! ' they cry . ' we will take
their king . death to the [???] ! death to the [???] ! death to the
robbers of the north ! ' such names they have for us . not in half a thousand
years have they forgotten their grievance that the lords of [???] gave the
mark to [???] the young and made alliance with him . that old hatred [???]
has inflamed . they are fierce folk when roused . they will not give way now
for [???] or dawn [???] until [???] is taken [???] or they themselves are slain . '
' nonetheless day will bring hope to me [???] ' said [???] . ' is it not said
that no foe has ever taken the [???] [???] if men defended it ? '
' so the [???] say [???] ' said jomer .
' then let us defend it [???] and hope ! ' said [???] .
even as they spoke there came a blare of trumpets . then there was a

crash and a flash of flame and smoke . the waters of the deeping - stream
poured out hissing and foaming : they were choked no longer [???] a gaping hole
was blasted in the wall . a host of dark shapes poured in .
' devilry of [???] ! ' cried [???] . ' they have crept in the [???]
again [???] while we talked [???] and they have lit the fire of orthanc beneath our
feet . [???] [???] [???] ! ' he shouted [???] as he leaped down into the breach ; but
even as he did so a hundred ladders were raised against the battlements .
over the wall and under the wall the last assault came sweeping like a dark
wave upon a hill of sand . the defence was swept away . some of the riders
were driven back [???] further and further into the deep [???] falling and fighting a s
they gave way [???] step by step [???] towards the caves . others cut their way back
towards the [???] .
a broad stairway [???] climbed from the deep up to the rock and the
rear - gate of the [???] . near the bottom stood [???] . in his hand still
and [???] ril gleamed [???] and the terror of the sword for a while held back the
enemy [???] as one by one all who could gain the stair passed up towards the
gate . behind on the upper steps knelt legolas . his bow was bent [???] but one
[???] arrow was all that he had left [???] and he peered out now [???] ready to
shoot the first orc that should dare to approach the stair .
' all who can have now got safe within [???] [???] [???] ' he called . ' come
back ! '
[???] turned and sped up the stair ; but as he ran he [???] in his
weariness . at once his enemies leapt forward . up came the [???] [???] yelling [???]
with their long arms stretched out to seize him . the foremost fell with
legolas ' last arrow in his throat . but the rest sprang over him . then a
great [???] [???] cast from the outer wall above [???] [???] down upon the stair [???]
and hurled them back into the deep . [???] gained the door [???] and swiftly it
clanged to behind him .
' things go ill [???] my friends [???] ' he said [???] wiping the sweat from his brow
with his arm .
' ill enough [???] ' said legolas [???] ' but not yet hopeless [???] while we have you
with us . where is [???] ? '
' i do not know . ' said [???] . ' i last saw him fighting on the ground
behind the wall [???] but the enemy swept us apart . '
' alas ! that is evil news [???] ' said legolas .
' he is stout and strong [???] ' said [???] . ' let us hope that he will
escape back to the caves . there he would be safe for a while . safer than we .

such a [???] would be to the liking of a dwarf . '
' that must be my hope ' ' said legolas . ' but i wish that he had come this
way . i desired to tell master [???] that my tale is now thirty - nine . '
' if he wins back to the caves [???] he will pass your count again [???] ' laughed
[???] . ' never did i see an axe so [???] . '
' i must go a nd seek some arrows [???] ' said legolas . ' would that this night
would end [???] and i could have better light for shooting . '
[???] now passed into the [???] . there to his dismay he learned
that jomer had not reached the [???] .
' nay [???] he did not come to the rock [???] ' said one of the westfold - men [???] ' i
last saw him gathering men about him and fighting in the mouth of the deep .
gamling was with him [???] and the dwarf ; but i could not come to them . '
[???] strode on through the inner court [???] and mounted to a high
chamber in the tower . there stood the king [???] dark against a narrow window [???]
looking out upon the vale .
' what is the news [???] [???] ? ' he said .
' the deeping wall is taken [???] lord [???] and all the defence swept away ; but
many have escaped hither to the rock . '
' is jomer here ? '
' no [???] lord . but many of your men retreated into the deep ; and some say
that jomer was amongst them . in the narrows they may hold back the enemy
and
come within the caves . what hope they may have then i do not know . '
' more than we . good provision [???] it is said . and the air is wholesome
there because of the outlets through [???] in the rock far above . none
can force an entrance against determined men . they may hold out long . '
' but the [???] have brought a devilry from orthanc [???] ' said [???] . ' they
have a blasting fire [???] and with it they took the wall . if they cannot come in
the caves [???] they may seal up those that are inside . but now we must turn all
our thoughts to our own defence . '
' i fret in this prison [???] ' said [???] . ' if i could have set a spear in
rest [???] riding before my men upon the field [???] maybe i could have felt again the
joy of battle [???] and so ended . but i serve little purpose here . '
' here at least you are guarded in the strongest fastness of the mark [???] '
said [???] . ' more hope we have to defend you in the [???] than in
[???] [???] or even at [???] in the mountains . '
' it is said that the [???] has never fallen to assault [???] ' said

[???] ; ' but now my heart is doubtful . the world changes [???] and all that once
was strong now proves unsure . how shall any tower withstand such numbers
and
such reckless hate ? had i known that the strength of [???] was grown so
great [???] maybe l should not so rashly have ridden forth to meet it [???] for all
the arts of [???] . his counsel seems not now so good as it did under the
morning sun . '
' do not judge the counsel of [???] [???] until all is over [???] lord [???] ' said
[???] .
' the end will not be long [???] ' said the king . ' but i will not end here [???]
taken like an old badger in a trap . [???] and [???] and the horses of
my guard are in the inner court . when dawn comes [???] i will bid men sound
helm ' s horn [???] and i will ride forth . will you ride with me then [???] son of
[???] ? maybe we shall cleave a road [???] or make such an end as will be worth
a song - if any be left to sing of us hereafter . '
' i will ride with you [???] ' said [???] .
taking his leave [???] he returned to the walls [???] and passed round all their
circuit [???] [???] the men [???] and lending aid wherever the assault was hot .
legolas went with him . blasts of fire leaped up from below shaking the
stones . [???] - hooks were hurled [???] and ladders raised . again and again the
[???] gained the summit of the outer wall [???] and again the defenders cast them
down .
at last [???] stood above the great gates [???] heedless of the darts of
the enemy . as he looked forth he saw the eastern sky grow pale . then he
raised his empty hand [???] palm outward in token of parley .
the [???] yelled and jeered . ' come down ! come down ! ' they cried . ' if you
wish to speak to us [???] come down ! bring out your king ! we are the fighting
[???] - hai . we will fetch him from his hole [???] if he does not come . bring out
your [???] king ! '
' the king stays or comes at his own will [???] ' said [???] .
' then what are you doing here ? ' they answered . ' why do you look out ? do
you wish to see the greatness of our army ? we are the fighting [???] - hai . '
' i looked out to see the dawn [???] ' said [???] .
' what of the dawn ? ' they jeered . ' we are the [???] - hai : we do not stop
the fight for night or day [???] for fair weather or for storm . we come to kill [???]
by sun or moon . what of the dawn ? '
' none knows what the new day shall bring him [???] ' said [???] . ' get you

gone [???] ere it turn to your evil . '
' get down or we will shoot you from the wall [???] ' they cried . ' this is no
parley . you have nothing to say . '
' i have still this to say [???] ' answered [???] . ' no enemy has yet taken
the [???] . depart [???] or not one of you will be spared . not one will be left
alive to take back tidings to the north . you do not know your peril . '
so great a power and royalty was revealed in [???] [???] as he stood there
alone above the ruined gates before the host of his enemies [???] that many of
the wild men paused [???] and looked back over their shoulders to the valley [???] and
some looked up doubtfully at the sky . but the [???] laughed with loud voices ;
and a hail of darts and arrows whistled over the wall [???] as [???] leaped
down .
there was a roar and a blast of fire . the archway of the gate above
which he had stood a moment before [???] and [???] in smoke and
dust .
the [???] was scattered as if by a [???] . [???] ran to the
king ' s tower .
but even as the gate fell [???] and the [???] about it yelled [???] preparing to
charge [???] a murmur arose behind them . like a wind in the distance [???] and it grew
to a clamour of many voices crying strange news in the dawn . the [???] upon
the rock [???] hearing the rumour of dismay [???] wavered and looked back . and then [???]
sudden and terrible [???] from the tower above [???] the sound of the great horn of
helm rang out .
all that heard that sound trembled . many of the [???] cast themselves on
their faces and covered their ears with their claws . back from the deep the
echoes came [???] blast upon blast [???] as if on every cliff and hill a mighty herald
stood . but on the walls men looked up [???] listening with wonder ; for the echoes
did not die . ever the horn - blasts wound on among the hills ; nearer now and
louder they answered one to another [???] blowing fierce and free .
' helm ! helm ! ' the riders shouted . ' helm is arisen and comes back to
war . helm for [???] king ! '
and with that shout the king came . his horse was white as snow [???] golden
was his shield [???] and his spear was long . at his right hand was [???] [???]
[???] ' s heir [???] behind him rode the lords of the house of [???] the young .
light sprang in the sky . night departed .
' forth [???] ! ' with a cry and a great noise they charged . down from
the gates they roared [???] over the causeway they swept [???] and they drove through

the hosts of [???] as a wind among grass . behind them from the deep came
the stern cries of ' men issuing from the caves [???] driving forth the enemy . out
poured all the men that were left upon the rock . and ever the sound of
blowing horns echoed in the hills .
on they rode [???] the king and his companions . captains and champions fell
or fled before them . neither orc nor man [???] them . their backs were to
the swords and spears of the riders and their faces to the valley . they
cried and wailed [???] for fear and great wonder had come upon them with the
rising of the day .
so king [???] rode from helm ' s gate and clove his path to the great
dike . there the company halted . light grew bright about them . shafts of the
sun flared above the eastern hills and [???] on their spears . but they
sat silent on their horses [???] and they gazed down upon the deeping - coomb .
the land had changed . where before the green dale had lain [???] its grassy
[???] lapping the ever - mounting hills [???] there now a forest loomed . great
trees [???] bare and silent [???] stood [???] rank on rank [???] with tangled bough and hoary
head ; their twisted roots were buried in the long green grass . darkness was
under them . between the dike and the eaves of that nameless wood only two
open [???] lay . there now cowered the proud hosts of [???] [???] in terror
of the king and in terror of the trees . they streamed down from helm ' s gate
until all above the dike was empty of them [???] but below it they were packed
like swarming flies . vainly they [???] and [???] about the walls of
the coomb . seeking to escape . upon the east too sheer and stony was the
valley ' s side ; upon the left [???] from the west [???] their final doom approached .
there suddenly upon a ridge appeared a rider [???] clad in white [???] shining in
the rising sun . over the low hills the horns were sounding . behind him [???]
hastening down the long [???] [???] were a thousand men on foot ; their swords
were in their hands . amid them strode a man tall and strong . his shield was
red . as he came to the valley ' s brink [???] he set to his lips a great black horn
and blew a ringing blast .
' [???] ! ' the riders shouted . ' [???] ! '
' behold the white rider ! ' cried [???] . ' [???] is come again ! '
' [???] [???] [???] ! ' said legolas . ' this is [???] indeed ! come !
i would look on this forest [???] ere the spell changes . '
the hosts of [???] roared [???] swaying this way and that [???] turning from
fear to fear . again the horn sounded from the tower . down through the breach
of the dike charged the king ' s company . down from the hills leaped

[???] [???] lord of westfold . down leaped [???] [???] like a deer that runs
[???] in the mountains . the white rider was upon them [???] and the terror
of his coming filled the enemy with madness . the wild men fell on their
faces before him . the [???] [???] and screamed and cast aside both sword and
spear . like a black smoke driven by a mounting wind they fled . wailing they
passed under the waiting shadow of the trees ; and from that shadow none ever
came again .




chapter 8 . the road to [???]



so it was that in the light of a fair morning king [???] and [???]
the white rider met again upon the green grass beside the deeping - stream .
there was also [???] son of [???] [???] and legolas the elf [???] and [???]
of westfold [???] and the lords of the golden house . about them were gathered the
[???] [???] the riders of the mark : wonder overcame their joy in victory [???] and
their eyes were turned towards the wood .
suddenly there was a great shout [???] and down from the dike came those who
had been driven back into the deep . there came gamling the old [???] and jomer
son of jomund [???] and beside them walked [???] the dwarf . he had no helm [???]
and
about his head was a linen band stained with blood ; but his voice was loud
and strong .
' forty - two [???] master legolas ! ' he cried . ' alas ! my axe is notched : the
forty - second had an iron collar on his neck . how is it with you ? '
' you have passed my score by one [???] ' answered legolas . ' but i do not
grudge you the game [???] so glad am i to see you on your legs ! '
' welcome [???] jomer [???] sister - son ! ' said [???] . ' now that i see you safe [???] i
am glad indeed . '
' hail [???] lord of the mark ! ' said jomer . ' the dark night has passed and
day has come again . but the day has brought strange tidings . ' he turned and
gazed in wonder [???] first at the wood and then at [???] . ' once more you come
in the hour of need [???] [???] - for [???] ' he said .
' [???] - for ? ' said [???] . ' i said that i would return and meet you
here . '
' but you did not name the hour [???] nor foretell the manner of your coming .
strange help you bring . you are mighty in [???] [???] [???] the white ! '
' that may be . but if so [???] i have not shown it yet . i have but given good
counsel in peril [???] and made use of the speed of [???] . your own valour
has done more [???] and the stout legs of the westfold - men marching through the
night . '
then they all gazed at [???] with still greater wonder . some glanced
darkly at the wood [???] and passed their hands over their brows [???] as if they
thought their eyes saw otherwise than his .

[???] laughed long and merrily . ' the trees ? ' he said . ' nay [???] i see the
wood as plainly as do you . but that is no deed of mine . it is a thing beyond
the counsel of the wise . better than my design [???] and better even than my hope
the event has proved . '
' then if not yours [???] whose is the [???] ? ' said [???] . ' not
[???] ' s [???] that is plain . is there some mightier sage [???] of whom we have yet
to learn ? '
' it is not [???] [???] but a power far older [???] ' said [???] : ' a power
that walked the earth [???] ere elf sang or hammer rang .
ere iron was found or tree was hewn [???]
when young was mountain under moon ;
ere ring was made [???] or wrought was woe [???]
it walked the forests long ago . '
' and what may be the answer to your riddle ? ' said [???] .
' if you would learn that [???] you should come with me to [???] '
answered [???] .
' to [???] ? ' they cried .
' yes [???] ' said [???] . ' i shall return to [???] [???] and those who will
may come with me . there we may see strange things . '
' but there are not men enough in the mark [???] not if they were all
gathered together and healed of wounds and weariness [???] to assault the
stronghold of [???] [???] ' said [???] .
' nevertheless to [???] i go [???] ' said [???] . ' i shall not stay there
long . my way lies now eastward . look for me in [???] [???] ere the waning of the
moon ! '
' nay ! ' said [???] . ' in the dark hour before dawn i doubted [???] but we
will not part now . i will come with you [???] if that is your counsel . '
' i wish to speak with [???] [???] as soon as may be now [???] ' said [???] [???]
' and since he has done you great injury [???] it would be fitting if you were
there . but how soon and how swiftly will you ride ? '
' my men are weary with battle [???] ' said the king ; ' and i am weary also .
for i have ridden far and slept little . alas ! my old age is not feigned nor
due only to the whisperings of [???] . it is an ill that no leech can
wholly cure [???] not even [???] . '
' then let all who are to ride with me rest now [???] ' said [???] . ' we will
journey under the shadow of evening . it is as well ; for it is my counsel
that all our comings and goings should be as secret as may be [???] henceforth .

but do not command many men to go with you [???] [???] . we go to a parley
not
to a fight . '
the king then chose men that were [???] and had swift horses [???] and he
sent them forth with tidings of the victory into every vale of the mark ; and
they bore his summons also [???] bidding all men [???] young and old [???] to come in haste
to [???] . there the lord of the mark would hold an assembly of all that
could bear arms [???] on the second day after the full moon . to ride with him to
[???] the king chose jomer and twenty men of his household . with
[???]
would go [???] [???] and legolas [???] and [???] . in spite of his hurt the dwarf
would not stay behind .
' it was only a feeble blow and the cap turned it ; ' he said . ' it would
take more than such an orc - scratch to keep me back . '
' i will tend it [???] while you rest [???] ' said [???] .
the king now returned to the [???] [???] and slept [???] such a sleep of quie t
as he had not known for many years [???] and the remainder of his chosen company
rested also . but the others [???] all that were not hurt or wounded [???] began a
great labour ; for many had fallen in the battle and lay dead upon the field
or in the deep .
no [???] remained alive ; their bodies were [???] . but a great many
of the hillmen had given themselves up ; and they were afraid [???] and cried for
mercy .
the men of the mark took their weapons from them [???] and set them to work .
' help now to repa ir the evil in which you have joined [???] ' said
[???] ; ' and afterwards you shall take an oath never again to pass the
fords of isen in arms [???] nor to march with the enemies of men ; and then you
shall go free back to your land . for you have been deluded by [???] . many
of you have got death as the reward of your trust in him ; but had you
conquered [???] little better would your wages have been . '
the men of dunland were amazed [???] for [???] had told them that the men
of [???] were cruel and burned their captives alive .
in the midst of the field before the [???] two mounds were raised [???]
and beneath them were laid all the riders of the mark who fell in the
defence [???] those of the east dales upon one side [???] and those of westfold upon
the other . in a _ grave alone under the shadow of the [???] lay [???] [???]
captain of the king ' s guard . he fell before the gate .

the [???] were piled in great heaps [???] away from the mounds of men [???] not
far from the eaves of the forest . and the people were troubled in their
minds ; for the heaps of carrion were too great for burial or for burning .
they had little wood for firing [???] and none would have dared to take an axe to
the strange trees [???] even if [???] had not warned them to hurt neither bark
nor bough at their great peril .
' let the [???] lie [???] ' said [???] . ' the morning may bring new counsel . '
in the afternoon the king ' s company prepared to depart . the work of
burial was then but beginning ; and [???] mourned for the loss of [???] [???] his
captain [???] and cast the first earth upon his grave . ' great injury indeed has
[???] done to me and all this land [???] ' he said ; ' and i will remember it [???]
when we meet . '
the sun was already drawing near the hills upon the west of the coomb [???]
when at last [???] and [???] and their companions rode down from the
dike . behind them were gathered a great host [???] both of the riders and of the
people of westfold [???] old and young [???] women and children [???] who had come out
from
the caves . a song of victory they sang with clear voices ; and then they fell
silent [???] wondering what would chance [???] for their eyes were on the trees and
they feared them .
the riders came to the wood [???] and they halted ; horse and man [???] they were
unwilling to pass in . t he trees were grey and [???] [???] and a shadow or a
mist was about them . the ends of their long sweeping boughs hung down like
searching fingers [???] their roots stood up from the ground like the limbs of
strange monsters [???] and dark [???] opened benea th them . but [???] went
forward [???] leading the company [???] and where the road from the [???] met the
trees they saw now an opening like an arched gate under mighty boughs ; and
through it [???] passed [???] and they followed him . then to their amazement
they found that the road ran on [???] and the deeping - stream beside it ; and the
sky was open above and full of golden light . but on either side the great
[???] of the wood were already wrapped in [???] [???] stretching away into
[???] shadows ; and there they heard the creaking and groaning of
boughs [???] and far cries [???] and a rumour of wordless voices [???] murmuring angrily .
no orc or other living creature could be seen .
legolas and [???] were now riding together upon one horse ; and they
kept close beside [???] [???] for [???] was afraid of the wood .
' it is hot in here [???] ' said legolas to [???] . ' i feel a great wrath

about me . do you not feel the air throb in your ears ? '
' yes [???] ' said [???] .
' what has become of the miserable [???] ? ' said legolas .
' that [???] i think [???] no one will ever know [???] ' said [???] .
they rode in silence for a while ; but legolas was ever glancing from
side to side [???] and would often have halted to listen to the sounds of the
wood [???] if [???] had allowed it .
' these are the strangest trees that ever i saw [???] ' he said ; ' and i have
seen many an oak grow from acorn to ruinous age . i wish that there were
leisure now to walk among them : they have voices [???] and in time i might come
to understand their thought . '
' no [???] no ! ' said [???] . ' let us leave them ! i guess their thought
already : hatred of all that go on two legs ; and their speech is of crushing
and strangling . '
' not of all that go on two legs [???] ' said legolas . ' there i think you are
wrong . it is [???] that they hate . for they do not belong here and know
little of elves and men . far away are the [???] where they sprang . from
the deep dales of fangorn [???] [???] [???] that is whence they come [???] i guess . '
' then that is the most perilous wood in middle - earth [???] ' said [???] . ' i
should be grateful for the part they have played [???] but i do not love them .
you may think them wonderful [???] but i have seen a greater wonder in this land [???]
more beautiful than any grove or glade that ever grew : my heart is still
full of ft . ' strange are the ways of men [???] legolas ! here they have one of the
marvels of the northern world [???] and what do they say of it ? caves [???] they say !
caves ! holes to fly to in time of war [???] to store [???] in ! my good legolas [???]
do you know that the [???] of helm ' s deep are vast and beautiful ? there
would be an endless pilgrimage of [???] [???] merely to gaze at them [???] if such
things were known to be . aye indeed [???] they would pay pure gold for a brief
glance ! '
' and i would give gold to be excused [???] ' said legolas ; ' and double to be
let out [???] if i strayed in ! '
' you have not seen [???] so i forgive your jest [???] ' said [???] . ' but you speak
like a fool . do you think those halls are fair [???] where your king dwells under
the hill in [???] [???] and [???] helped in their making long ago ? they are
but hovels compared with the [???] i have seen here : [???] halls [???]
filled with an everlasting music of water that tinkles into [???] [???] as fair
as [???] - [???] in the starlight .

' and [???] legolas [???] when the torches are kindled and men walk on the sandy
floors under the echoing domes [???] ah ! then [???] legolas [???] gems and crystals and
veins of precious ore glint in the polished walls ; and the light glows
through folded marbles [???] shell - like [???] [???] as the living hands of queen
[???] . there are [???] of white and [???] and dawn - rose [???] legolas [???]
fluted and twisted into dreamlike forms ; they spring up from many - coloured
floors to meet the [???] [???] of the roof : wings [???] ropes [???] curtains
fine as frozen clouds ; spears [???] banners [???] [???] of [???] palaces !
still lakes mirror them : a [???] world looks up from dark [???] covered
with clear glass ; cities . such as the mind of durin could scarce have
imagined in his sleep [???] stretch on through avenues and pillared courts [???] on
into the dark recesses where no light can come . and plink ! a silver drop
falls [???] and the round wrinkles in the glass make all the towers bend and
waver like weeds and corals in a [???] of the sea . then evening comes : they
fade and [???] out ; the torches pass on into another chamber and another
dream . there is chamber after chamber [???] legolas ; hall opening out of hall [???]
dome after dome [???] stair beyond stair ; and still the winding paths lead on
into the mountains ' heart . caves ! the [???] of helm ' s deep ! happy was the
chance that drove me there ! it makes me weep to leave them . '
' then i will wish you this fortune for your comfort [???] [???] [???] ' said the
elf [???] ' that you may come safe from war and return to see them again . but do
not tell all your kindred ! there seems little left for them to do [???] from your
account . maybe the men of this land are wise to say little : one family of
busy [???] with hammer and [???] might mar more than they made . '
' no [???] you do not understand [???] ' said [???] . ' no dwarf could be [???] by
such loveliness . none of durin ' s race would mine those caves for stones or
ore [???] not if diamonds and gold could be got there . do you cut down groves of
blossoming trees in the spring - time for [???] ? we would tend these glades
of flowering stone [???] not quarry them . with [???] skill [???] tap by tap - - a
small chip of rock and no more [???] perhaps [???] in a whole anxious day - - so we
could work [???] and as the years went by [???] we should open up new ways [???] and
display far chambers that are still dark [???] [???] only as a void beyond
[???] in the rock . and lights [???] legolas ! we should make lights [???] such lamps
as once shone in [???] - dym ; and when we wished we would drive away
the
night that has lain there since the hills were made ; and when we desired
rest [???] we would let the night return . '

' you move me [???] [???] [???] ' said legolas . ' i have never heard you speak like
this before . almost you make me regret that i have not seen these caves .
come ! let us make this bargain - if we both return safe out of the perils that
[???] us [???] we will journey for a while together . you shall visit fangorn with
me [???] and then i will come with you to see helm ' s deep . '
' that would not be the way of return that i should choose [???] ' said [???] .
' but i will endure fangorn [???] if i have your promise to come back to the caves
and share their wonder with me . '
' you have my promise [???] ' said legolas . ' but alas ! now we must leave
behind both cave and wood for a while : see ! we are coming to the end of the
trees . how far is it to [???] [???] [???] ? '
' about fifteen leagues [???] as the crows of [???] make it . ' said [???] :
' five from the mouth of deeping - coomb to the fords : and ten more from there
to the gates of [???] . but we shall not ride all the way this night . '
' and when we come there [???] what shall we see ? ' asked [???] . ' you may
know [???] but i cannot guess . '
' i do not know myself for certain [???] ' answered the [???] . ' i was there
at nightfall yesterday [???] but much may have happened since . yet i think that
you will not say that the journey was in vain - - not though the glittering
caves of [???] be left behind . '
at last the company passed through the trees [???] and found that they had
come to the bottom of the coomb [???] where the road from helm ' s deep
branched [???]
going one way east to [???] [???] and the other north to the fords of isen . as
they rode from under the eaves of the wood [???] legolas halted and looked back
with regret . then he gave a sudden cry .
' there are eyes ! ' he said . ' eyes looking out from the shadows of the
boughs ! i never saw such eyes before . '
the others [???] surprised by his cry [???] halted and turned ; but legolas
started to ride back .
' no [???] no ! ' cried [???] . ' do as you please in your madness [???] but let me
first get down from this horse ! i wish to see no eyes ! ' ' stay [???] legolas
[???] ! ' said [???] . ' do not go back into the wood [???] not yet ! now is not
your time . '
even as he spoke [???] there came forward out of the trees three strange
shapes . as tall as [???] they were [???] twelve feet or more in height ; their
strong bodies [???] stout as young trees [???] seemed to be clad with raiment or with

hide of close - fitting grey and br own . their limbs were long [???] and their hands
had many fingers ; their hair was stiff [???] and their beards grey - green as moss .
they gazed out with solemn eyes [???] but they were not looking at the riders :
their eyes were bent northwards . suddenly they lifted their long hands to
their mouths [???] and sent forth ringing calls [???] clear as notes of a horn [???] but
more musical and various . the calls were answered ; and turning again [???] the
riders saw other creatures of the same kind approaching [???] striding through
the grass . they came swiftly from the north [???] walking like wading herons in
their gait [???] but not in their speed ; for their legs in their long paces beat
quicker than the heron ' s wings . the riders cried aloud in wonder [???] and some
set their hands upon their swor d - [???] .
' you need no weapons [???] ' said [???] . ' these are but [???] . they are
not enemies [???] indeed they are not concerned with us at all . '
so it seemed to be ; for as he spoke the tall creatures [???] without a
glance at the riders [???] strode into the wood and vanished .
' [???] ! ' said [???] . ' where are their flocks ? what are they [???]
[???] ? for it is plain that to you [???] at any rate [???] they are not strange . '
' they are the shepherds of the trees [???] ' answered [???] . ' is it so long
since you listened to tales by the fireside ? there are children in your land
who [???] out of the twisted threads of story [???] could pick the answer to your
question . you have seen ents [???] o king [???] ents out of fangorn forest [???] which in
your tongue you call the [???] . did you think that the name was given only
in idle fancy ? nay [???] [???] [???] it is otherwise : to them you are but the
passing tale ; all the years from [???] the young to [???] the old are of
little count to them ; and all the deeds of your house but a small matter . '
the king was silent . ' ents ! ' he said at length . ' out of the shadows of
legend i begin a little to understand the marvel of the trees [???] i think . i
have lived to see strange days . long we have tended our beasts and our
fields [???] built our houses [???] wrought our tools [???] or ridden away to help in the
wars of minas [???] . and that we called the life of men [???] the way of the
world . we cared little for what lay beyond the borders of our land . songs we
have that tell of these things [???] but we are forgetting them [???] teaching them
only to children [???] as a careless custom . and now the songs have come down
among us out of strange places [???] and walk visible under the sun . '
' you should be glad [???] [???] king [???] ' said [???] . ' for not only the
little life of men is now [???] [???] but the life also of those things
which you have deemed the matter of legend . you are not without allies [???] even

if you know them not . '
' yet also i should be sad [???] ' said [???] . ' for however the fortune of
war shall go [???] may it not so end that much that was fair and wonderful shall
pass for ever out of middle - earth ? '
' it may [???] ' said [???] . ' the evil of [???] cannot be wholly cured [???] nor
made as if it had not been . but to such days we are doomed . let us now go on
with the journey we have begun ! '
the company turned then away from the coomb and from the wood and
took
the road towards the fords . legolas followed [???] . the sun had set [???]
already it had sunk behind the rim of the world ; but as they rode out from
the shadow of the hills and looked west to the gap of [???] the sky was
still red [???] and a burning light was under the floating clouds . dark against
it there wheeled and flew many black - winged birds . some passed overhead
wi th
mournful cries [???] returning to their homes among the rocks .
' the carrion - fowl have been busy about the battle - field [???] ' said jomer .
they rode now at an easy pace and dark came down upon the plains about
them . the slow moon mounted [???] now waxing towards the full [???] and in its cold
silver light the swelling grass - lands rose and fell like a wide grey sea .
they had ridden for some four hours from the branching of the roads when
they drew near to the fords . long [???] ran swiftly down to where the river
spread in stony shoals between high grassy terraces . borne upon the wind
they heard the howling of wolves . their hearts were heavy [???] remembering the
many men that had fallen in battle in this place .
the road dipped between rising turf - banks [???] carving its way through the
terraces to the river ' s edge [???] and up again upon the further side . there were
three lines of flat stepping - stones across the stream [???] and between them
fords for horses [???] that went from either brink to a bare eyot in the midst .
the riders looked down upon the crossings [???] and it seemed strange to them ;
for the fords had ever been a place full of the rush and chatter of water
upon stones ; but now they were silent . the beds of the stream were almost
dry [???] a bare wast e of [???] and grey sand .
' this is become a dreary place [???] ' said jomer . ' what sickness has
befallen the river ? many fair things [???] has destroyed : has he devoured
the springs of isen too ? ' ' so it would seem [???] ' said [???] .
' alas ! ' said [???] . ' must we pass this way [???] where the carrion - beasts

devour so many good riders of the mark ? '
' this is our way [???] ' said [???] . ' grievous is the fall of your men ; but
you shall see that at least the wolves of the mountains do not devour them .
it is with their friends [???] the [???] [???] that they hold their feast : such indeed
is the friendship of their kind . come ! '
they rode down to the river [???] and as they came the wolves ceased their
howling and slunk away . fear fell on them seeing [???] in the moon [???] and
[???] his horse shining like silver . the riders passed over to the
islet [???] and glittering eyes watched them wanly from the shadows of the banks .
' look ! ' said [???] . ' friends have laboured here . '
and they saw that in the midst of the eyot a mound was piled [???] ringed
with stones [???] and set about with many spears .
' here lie all the men of the mark that fell near this place [???] ' said
[???] .
' here let them rest ! ' said jomer . ' and when their spears have rotted
and rusted [???] long still may their mound stand and guard the fords of isen ! '
' is this your work also [???] [???] [???] my friend ? ' said [???] . ' you
accomplished much in an evening and a night ! '
' with the help of [???] - - and others [???] ' said [???] . ' i rode fast
and far . but here beside the mound i will say this for your comfort : many
fell in the battles of the fords [???] but fewer than rumour made them . more were
scattered than were slain ; i gathered together all that i could find . some
men i sent with [???] of westfold to join [???] . some i set to make
this burial . they have now followed your marshal [???] [???] . i sent him with
many riders to [???] . [???] i knew had [???] his full strength
against you [???] and his servants had turned aside from all other errands and
gone to helm ' s deep : the lands seemed empty of enemies ; yet i feared that
wolf - riders and [???] might ride nonetheless to [???] [???] while it was
[???] . but now i think you need not fear : you will find your house to
welcome your return . '
' and glad shall i be to see it again [???] ' said [???] [???] ' though brief now [???]
i doubt not [???] shall be my abiding there . '
with that the company said farewell to the island and the mound [???] and
passed over the river [???] and climbed the further bank . then they rode on [???] glad
to have left the mournful fords . as they went the howling of the wolves
broke out anew .
there was an ancient highway that ran down from [???] to the

crossings . for some way i t took its course beside the river [???] bending with it
east and then north ; but at the last it turned away and went straight
towards the gates of [???] ; and these were under the mountain - side in the
west of the valley [???] sixteen miles or more from its mouth . this road they
followed but they did not ride upon it ; for the ground beside it was firm
and level [???] covered for many miles about with short springing turf . they rode
now more swiftly [???] and by midnight the fords were nearly five leagues behind .
then they halted [???] ending their night ' s journey [???] for the king was weary . they
were come to the feet of the misty mountains [???] and the long arms of nan
[???] stretched down to meet them . dark lay the vale before them [???] for the
moon had passed into the west [???] and its light was hidden by the hills . but
out of the deep shadow of the dale rose a vast spire of smoke and vapour ; as
it mounted [???] it caught the rays of the sinking moon [???] and spread in [???]
billows [???] black and silver [???] over the starry sky .
' what do you think of that [???] [???] ? ' asked [???] . ' one would say
that all the [???] ' s vale was burning . '
' there is ever a fume above that valley in these days [???] ' said jomer :
' but i have never seen aught like this before . these are steams rather than
smokes . [???] is brewing some devilry to greet us . maybe he is boiling all
the waters of isen [???] and that is why the river runs dry . '
' maybe he is [???] ' said [???] . ' tomorrow we shall learn what he is doing .
now let us rest for a while [???] if we can . '
they camped beside the bed of the isen river ; it was still silent and
empty . some of them slept a little . but late in the night the watchmen cried
out [???] and all awoke . the moon was gone . stars were shining above ; but over
the ground there crept a darkness blacker than the night . on both sides of
the river it rolled towards them [???] going northward .
' stay where you are ! ' said [???] . ' draw no weapons ! wait ! and it will
pass you by ! '
a mist gathered about them . above them a few stars still [???]
faintly ; but on either side there arose walls of [???] gloom ; they
were in a narrow lane between moving towers of shadow . voices they heard [???]
whisperings and groanings and an endless rustling sigh ; the earth shook
under them . long it seemed to them that they sat and were afraid ; but at
last the darkness and the rumour passed [???] and vanished between the mountain ' s
arms .
away south upon the [???] [???] in the middle night men heard a great

noise [???] as a wind in the valley [???] and the ground trembled ; and all were afraid
and no one ventured to go forth . but in the morning they went out and were
amazed ; for the slain [???] were gone [???] and the trees also . far down into the
valley of the deep the grass was crushed and trampled brown [???] as if giant
[???] had pastured great droves of cattle there ; but a mile below the
dike a huge pit had been delved in the earth [???] and over it stones were piled
into a hill . men believed that the [???] whom they had slain were buried
there ; but whether those who had fled into the wood were with them [???] none
could say [???] for no man ever set foot upon that hill . the death down it was
afterwards called [???] and no grass would grow there . but the strange trees were
never seen in deeping - coomb again ; they had returned at night [???] and had gone
far away to the dark dales of fangorn . thus they were revenged upon the
[???] .
the king and his company slept no more that night ; but they saw and
heard no other strange thing [???] sa ve one : the voice of the river beside them
suddenly awoke . there was a rush of water hurrying down among the stones ;
and when it had passed [???] the isen flowed and [???] in its bed again [???] as it
had ever done .
at dawn they made ready to go on . the light came grey and pale [???] and
they did not see the rising of the sun . the air above was heavy with fog [???]
and a reek lay on the land about them . they went slowly [???] riding now upon the
highway . it was broad and hard [???] and well - tended . dimly through the mists
they could descry the long arm of the mountains rising on their left . they
had passed into nan [???] [???] the [???] ' s vale . that was a sheltered valley [???]
open only to the south . once it had been fair and green [???] and through it the
isen flowed [???] already deep and strong before it found the plains ; for it was
fed by many springs and lesser streams among the rain - washed hills . and all
about it there had lain a pleasant [???] fertile land .
it was not so now . beneath the walls of [???] there still were acres
tilled by the slaves of [???] ; but most of the valley had become a
wilderness of weeds and thorns . [???] trailed upon the ground [???] or
[???] over bush and bank [???] made [???] caves where small beasts
housed .
no trees grew there ; but among the rank grasses could still be seen the
burned and axe - hewn stumps of ancient groves . it was a sad country [???] silent
now but for the stony noise of quick waters . smokes and steams drifted in
sullen clouds and lurked in the hollows . the riders did not speak . many

doubted in their hearts [???] wondering to what dismal end their journey led .
after they had ridden for some miles [???] the highway became a wide street [???]
paved with great flat stones [???] squared and laid with skill ; no blade of grass
was seen in any joint . deep [???] [???] filled with trickling water . ran down
on either side . suddenly a tall pillar loomed up before them . it was black ;
and set upon it was a great stone [???] carved and painted in the likeness of a
long white hand . its finger pointed north . not far now they knew that the
gates of [???] must stand [???] and their hearts were heavy ; but their eyes
could not pierce the mists ahead .
beneath the mountain ' s arm within the [???] ' s vale through years
[???] had stood that ancient place that men called [???] . partly it
was shaped in the making of the mountains [???] but mighty works the men of
westernesse had wrought there of old ; and [???] had dwelt there long and
had not been idle .
this was its fashion [???] while [???] was at his height [???] accounted by
many the chief of [???] . a great ring - wall of stone [???] like towering cliffs [???]
stood out from the shelter of the mountain - side [???] from which it ran and then
returned again . one entrance only was there made in it [???] a great arch delved
in the southern wall . here through the black rock a long tunnel had been
hewn [???] closed at either end with mighty doors of iron . they were so wrought
and poised upon their huge [???] [???] posts of steel driven into the living
stone [???] that when [???] they could be moved with a light thrust of the
arms [???] [???] . one who passed in and came at length out of the echoing
tunnel [???] beheld a plain [???] a great circle [???] somewhat hollowed like a vast
shallow bowl : a mile it measured from rim to rim . once it had been green and
filled with avenues [???] and groves of fruitful trees [???] watered by streams that
flowed from the mountains to a lake . but no green thing grew there in the
latter days of [???] . the roads wer e paved with stone - flags [???] dark and
hard ; and beside their borders instead of trees there marched long lines of
pillars [???] some of marble [???] some of copper and of iron . joined by heavy chains .
many houses there were [???] chambers [???] halls [???] and passages [???] cut and
[???] back into the walls upon their inner side [???] so that all the open
circle was overlooked by countless windows and dark doors . thousands could
dwell there [???] workers [???] servants [???] slaves [???] and warriors with great store of
arms ; wolves were fed and stabled in deep dens beneath . the plain [???] too [???] was
bored and delved . shafts were driven deep into the ground ; their upper ends
were covered by low mounds and domes of stone [???] so that in the moonlight the

ring of [???] looked like a graveyard of unquiet dead . for the ground
trembled . the shafts ran down by many [???] and spiral stairs to [???]
far under ; there [???] had [???] [???] store - houses [???] armouries [???] smithies [???]
and great furnaces . iron wheels revolved there endlessly [???] and hammers
[???] . at night plumes of vapour steamed from the vents [???] lit from beneath
with red light [???] or blue [???] or venomous green .
to the centre all the roads ran between their chains . there stood a
tower of marvellous shape . it was fashioned by the builders of old [???] who
smoothed the ring of [???] [???] and yet it seemed a thing not made by the
craft of men [???] but riven from the bones of the earth in the ancient torment
of the hills . a peak and isle of rock it was . black and gleaming hard : four
mighty piers of many - sided stone were welded into one [???] but near the summit
they opened into gaping horns . their [???] sharp as the points of
spears [???] keen - edged as knives . between them was a narrow space [???] and there
upon a floor of polished stone [???] written with strange signs [???] a man might
stand five hundred feet above the plain . this was orthanc [???] the [???] of
[???] [???] the name of which had ( by design or chance ) a twofold meaning ; for
in the elvish speech orthanc signifies mount fang [???] but in the language of
the mark of old the cunning mind .
a strong place and wonderful was [???] [???] and long it had been
beautiful ; and there great lords had dwelt [???] the wardens of [???] upon the
west [???] and wise men that watched the stars . but [???] had slowly shaped it
to his shifting purposes [???] and made it better . as he thought [???] being
deceived - for all those arts and subtle devices [???] for which he forsook his
former wisdom [???] and which fondly he imagined were his own . came but
from
[???] ; so that what he made was naught [???] only a little copy [???] a child ' s model
or a slave ' s flattery [???] of that vast fortress . armoury [???] prison [???] furnace of
great power [???] barad - dyr [???] the dark tower [???] which suffered no rival [???] and laughed
at flattery [???] biding its time [???] secure in its pride and its [???]
strength .
this was the stronghold of [???] [???] as fame reported it ; for within
living memory the men of [???] had not passed its gates [???] save perhaps a few [???]
such as [???] [???] who came in secret and told no man what they saw .
now [???] rode to the great pillar of the hand [???] and passed it : and as
he did so the riders saw to their wonder that the hand appeared no longer
white . it was stained as with dried blood ; and looking closer they perceived

that its nails were red . [???] [???] rode on into the mist [???] and
[???] they followed him . all about them now [???] as if there had been a
sudden flood . wide [???] of water lay beside the road [???] filling the hollows .
and [???] went trickling down among the stones .
at last [???] halted and beckoned to them ; and they came [???] and saw
that beyond him the mists had cleared [???] and a pale sunlight shone . the hour
of noon had passed . they were come to the doors of [???] .
but the doors lay hurled and twisted on the ground . and all about [???]
stone [???] cracked and [???] into countless jagged shards [???] was scattered
far and wide [???] or piled in ruinous heaps . the great arch still stood [???] but it
opened now upon a roofless chasm : the tunnel was laid bare . and through the
cliff - like walls on either side great rents and breaches had been torn ;
their towers were beaten into dust . if the great sea had risen in wrath and
fallen on the hills with storm . it could ha ve worked no greater ruin .
the ring beyond was filled with steaming water : a [???] cauldron [???] in
which there heaved and floated a wreckage of beams and spars [???] chests and
casks and broken gear . twisted and leaning pillars reared their [???]
stems above the flood . but all the roads were drowned . far off [???] it seemed [???]
half veiled in winding cloud [???] there loomed the island rock . still dark and
tall [???] [???] by the storm [???] the tower of orthanc stood . pale waters lapped
about its feet .
the king and all his company sat silent on their horses [???] marvelling [???]
perceiving that the power of [???] was overthrown ; but how they could not
guess . and now they turned their eyes towards the archway and the ruined
gates . there they saw close beside them a great rubble - heap ; and suddenly
they were aware of two small figures lying on it at their ease [???] grey - clad [???]
hardly to be seen among the stones . there were bottles and bowls and
platters laid beside them [???] as if they had just eaten well [???] and now rested
from their labour . one seemed asleep ; the other [???] with crossed legs and arms
behind his head [???] leaned back against a broken rock and sent from his mouth
long wisps and little rings of thin blue smoke .
for a moment [???] and jomer and all his men stared at them in
wonder . amid all the wreck of [???] this seemed to them the strangest
sight . but before the king could speak [???] the small smoke - breathing figure
became suddenly aware of them [???] as they sat there silent on the edge of the
mist . he sprang to his feet . a young man he looked [???] or like one [???] though not
much more than half a man in height ; his head of brown curling hair was

uncovered [???] but he was clad in a travel - stained cloak of the same hue and
shape a s the companions of [???] had worn when they rode to [???] . he
bowed very low . putting his hand upon his breast . then [???] seeming not to
observe the [???] and his friends [???] he turned to jomer and the king .
' welcome [???] my lords [???] to [???] ! ' he said . ' we are the [???] .
[???] [???] son of [???] is my name ; and my companion [???] who [???] alas ! is
overcome with weariness ' - - here he gave the other a dig with his foot - -
' is [???] [???] son of [???] [???] of the house of took . far in the north is our
home . the lord [???] is within ; but at the moment he is closeted with one
[???] [???] or doubtless he would be here to welcome such honourable
guests . '
' doubtless he would ! ' laughed [???] . ' and was it [???] that ordered
you to guard his damaged doors [???] and watch for the arrival of guests [???] when
your attention could be spared from plate and bottle ? '
' no [???] good sir [???] the matter escaped him [???] ' answered merry gravely ' he has
been much occupied . our orders came from [???] [???] who has taken over
the
management of [???] . he commanded me to welcome the lord of [???]
with
fitting words . i have done my best . '
' and what about your companions ? what about legolas and me ? ' cried
[???] [???] unable to contain himself longer . ' you rascals [???] you woolly - footed and
wool - pated truants ! a fine hunt you have led us ! two hundred leagues [???]
through fen and forest [???] battle and death [???] to rescue you ! and here we find
you feasting and idling - and smoking ! smoking ! where did you come by the
weed [???] you villains ? hammer and tongs ! i am so torn between rage and joy [???]
that if i do not burst . it will be a marvel ! '
' you speak for me [???] [???] [???] ' laughed legolas . ' though i would sooner
learn how they came by the wine . '
' one thing you have not found in your hunting [???] and that ' s brighter
wits [???] ' said [???] [???] opening an eye . ' here you find us sitting on a field of
victory [???] amid the plunder of armies [???] and you wonder how we came by a few
well - earned comforts ! '
' well - earned ? ' said [???] . ' i cannot believe that ! '
the riders laughed . ' it cannot be doubted that we witness the meeting
of dear friends [???] ' said [???] . ' so these are the lost ones of your company [???]
[???] ? the days are fated to be filled with marvels . already i have seen

many since i left my house ; and now here before my eyes stand yet another of
the folk of legend . are not these the halflings [???] that some among us call the
[???] ? '
' [???] [???] if you please [???] lord [???] ' said [???] .
' [???] ? ' said [???] . ' your tongue is strangely changed ; but the
name sounds not unfitting so . [???] ! no report that i have heard does
justice to the truth . '
merry bowed ; and [???] got up and bowed low . ' you are gracious [???] lord ;
or i hope that i may so take your words [???] ' he said . ' and here is another
marvel ! i have wandered in many lands [???] since i left my home [???] and never till
now have i found people that knew any story concerning [???] . '
' my people came out of the north long ago [???] ' said [???] . ' but i will
not deceive you : we know no tales about [???] . all that is said among us
is that far away [???] over many hills and rivers [???] live the halfling folk that
dwell in holes in sand - dunes . but there are no [???] of their deeds . for
it is said that they do little [???] and avoid the sight of men [???] being able to
vanish in a [???] : and they can change their voices to resemble the
piping of birds . but it seems that more could be said . '
' it could indeed [???] lord [???] ' said merry .
' for one thing [???] ' said [???] [???] ' i had not heard that they spouted smoke
from their mouths . '
' that is not surprising [???] ' answered merry ; ' for it is an art which we
have not practised for more than a few generations . it was [???]
[???] [???] of [???] in the [???] [???] who first grew the true
pipe - weed in his gardens [???] about the year [???] according to our reckoning .
how old toby came by the plant . . . '
' you do not know your danger [???] [???] [???] ' interrupted [???] . ' these
[???] will sit on the edge of ruin and discuss the pleasures of the table [???]
or the small doings of their fathers [???] grandfathers [???] and great - grandfathers [???]
and remoter cousins to the ninth degree [???] if you encourage them with undue
patience . some other time wou ld be more fitting for the history of smoking .
where is [???] [???] merry ? '
' away on the north side [???] i believe . he went to get a drink - of clean
water . most of the other ents are with him [???] still busy at their work - - over
there . ' merry waved his hand towards the steaming lake ; and as they looked [???]
they heard a distant rumbling and rattling [???] as if an [???] was falling
from the mountain - side . far away came a hoom - hom [???] as of horns blowing

triumphantly .
' and is orthanc then left [???] ? ' asked [???] .
' there is the water [???] ' said merry . ' but [???] and some others are
watching it . not all those posts and pillars in the plain are of [???] ' s
planting . [???] [???] i think [???] is by the rock [???] near the foot of the stair . '
' yes [???] a tall grey ent is there [???] ' said legolas [???] ' but his arms are at his
sides [???] and he stands as still as a door - tree . '
' it is past noon [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and we at any rate have not eaten
since early morning . yet i wish to see [???] as soon as may be . did he
leave me no message [???] or has plate and bottle driven it from your mind ? '
' he left a message [???] ' said merry [???] ' and i was coming to it [???] but i have
been hindered by many other questions . i was to say that [???] if the lord of the
mark and [???] will ride to the northern wall they will find [???]
there [???] and he will welcome them . i may add that they will also find food of
the best there [???] it was discovered and selected by your humble servants . ' he
bowed .
[???] laughed . ' that is better ! ' he said . ' well [???] [???] . will you
ride with me to find [???] ? we must go round about [???] but it is not far .
when you see [???] [???] you will learn much . for [???] is fangorn [???] and
the eldest and chief of the ents [???] and when you speak with him you will hear
the speech of the oldest of all living things . '
' i will come with you [???] ' said [???] . ' farewell [???] my [???] ! may we
meet again in my house ! there you shall sit beside me and tell me all that
your hearts desire : the deeds of your grandsires [???] as far as you can reckon
them ; and we will speak also of [???] the old and his herb - lore . farewell ! '
the [???] bowed low . ' so that is the king of [???] ! ' said [???] in
an undertone . ' a fine old fellow . very polite . '



chapter 9 . [???] and [???]



[???] and the king ' s company rode away [???] turning eastward to make the
circuit of the ruined walls of [???] . but [???] [???] [???] [???] and legolas
remained behind . leaving arod and [???] to stray in search of grass [???] they
came and sat beside the [???] .
' well [???] well ! the hunt is over [???] and we meet again at last [???] where none of
us ever thought to come [???] ' said [???] .
' and now that the great ones have gone to discuss high matters [???] ' said
legolas [???] ' the hunters can per haps learn the answers to their own small
[???] . we tracked you as far as the forest [???] but there are still many
things that i should like to know the truth of . '
' and there is a great deal [???] too [???] that we want to know about you ' said
merry . ' we have learnt a few things through [???] [???] the old ent [???] but that
is not nearly enough . '
' all in good time [???] ' said legolas . ' we were the hunters [???] and you should
give an account of yourselves to us first . '
' or second [???] ' said [???] . ' it would go better after a meal . t have a
sore head ; and it is past mid - day . you truants might make amends by finding
us some of the plunder that you spoke of . food and drink would pay off some
of my score against you . '
' then you shall have it [???] ' said [???] . ' will you have it here [???] or in
more comfort in what ' s left of [???] ' s guard - house - - over there under the
arch ? we had to [???] out here [???] so as to keep an eye on the road . '
' less than an eye ! ' said [???] . ' but i will not go into any orc - house
nor touch [???] ' meat or anything that they have mauled . '
' we wouldn ' t ask you to [???] ' said merry . ' we have had enough of [???]
ourselves to last a life - time . but there were many other folk in [???] .
[???] kept enough wisdom not to trust his [???] . he had men to guard his
gates : some of his most faithful servants [???] i suppose . anyway they were
favoured and got good provisions . '
' and pipe - weed ? ' asked [???] .
' no [???] i don ' t think so [???] ' merry laughed . ' but that is another story [???]
which can wait until after lunch . '
' well let us go and have lunch then ! ' said the dwarf .

the [???] led the way ; and they passed under the arch and came to a
wide door upon the left [???] at the top of a stair . it opened direct into a
large chamber [???] with other smaller doors at the far end [???] and a hearth and
chimney at one side . the chamber was hewn out of the stone ; and it must once
have been dark [???] for its windows looked out only into the tunnel . but light
came in now through the broken roof . on the hearth wood was burning .
' i lit a bit of fire [???] ' said [???] . ' it cheered us up in the fogs .
there were few [???] about [???] and most of the wood we could find was wet .
but there is a great draught in the chimney : it seems to wind away up
through the rock [???] and fortunately it has not been blocked . a fire is handy .
i will make you some toast . the bread is three or four days old [???] i am
afraid . '
[???] and his companions sat themselves down at one end of a long
table [???] and the [???] disappeared through one of the inner doors .
' store - room in there [???] and above the woods [???] luckily [???] ' said [???] [???] as they
came back laden with dishes [???] bowls [???] cups [???] knives [???] and food of various sorts .
' and you need not turn up your nose at the provender [???] master [???] [???] '
said merry . ' this is not orc - stuff [???] but man - food [???] as [???] calls it .
will you have wine or beer ? there ' s a barrel inside there - - very passable .
and this is first - rate salted pork . or i can cut you some rashers of bacon
and broil them [???] if you like . i am sorry there is no green stuff : the
deliveries have been rather interrupted in the last few days ! i cannot offer
you anything to follow but butter and honey for your bread . are you
content ? '
' indeed yes [???] ' said [???] . ' the score is much reduced . '
the three were soon busy with their meal ; and the two [???] [???]
[???] [???] set to a second time . ' we must keep our guests company [???] ' they
said .
' you are full of courtesy this morning [???] ' laughed legolas . ' but maybe .
if we had not arrived [???] you would already have been keeping one another
company again . '
' maybe ; and why not ? ' said [???] . ' we had foul fare with the [???] [???] and
little enough for days before that . it seems a long while since we could eat
to heart ' s content . '
' it does not seem to have done you any harm [???] ' said [???] . ' indeed you
look in the bloom of health . '
' aye [???] you do indeed [???] ' said [???] [???] looking them up and down over the top

of his cup . ' why [???] your hair is twice as thick and curly as when we parted ;
and i would swear that you have both grown somewhat [???] if that is possible for
[???] of your age . this [???] at any rate has not starved you . '
' he has not [???] ' said merry . ' but ents on ly drink [???] and drink is not enough
for content . [???] ' s draughts may be nourishing [???] but one feels the need
of something solid . and even [???] is none the worse for a change . '
' you have drunk of the waters of the ents [???] have you ? ' said legolas .
' ah [???] then i think it is likely that [???] ' s eyes do not deceive him . strange
songs have been sung of the draughts of fangorn . '
' many strange tales have been told about that land [???] ' said [???] . ' i
have never entered it . come [???] tell me more about it [???] and about the ents ! '
' ents [???] ' said [???] [???] ' ents are - - well ents are all different for on
thing . but their eyes now [???] their eyes are very odd . ' he tried a few fumbling
words that trailed off into silence . ' oh [???] well [???] ' he went on [???] ' you have seen
some at a distance [???] already - they saw you at any rate [???] and reported that you
were on the way - and you will see many others [???] i expect [???] before you leave
here . you must form your own ideas . '
' now [???] now ! ' said [???] . ' we are beginning the story in the middle . i
should like a tale in the right order [???] starting with that strange day when
our fellowship was broken . '
' you shall have it [???] if there is time [???] ' said merry . ' but first - if you
have finished eating - you shall fill your pipes and light up . and then for a
little while we can pretend that we are all back safe at bree again [???] or in
[???] . '
he produced a small leather bag full of tobacco . ' we have heaps of it [???] '
he said ; ' and you can all pack as much as you wish [???] when we go . we did some
[???] - work this morning [???] [???] and i . there are lots of things floating
about . it was [???] who found two small barrels [???] washed up out of some
cellar or store - house [???] i suppose . when we opened them [???] we found they were
filled with this : as fine a pipe - weed as you could wish for [???] and quite
[???] . '
[???] took some and rubbed it in his palms and [???] it . ' it feels
good [???] and it smells good [???] ' he said .
' it is good ! ' said merry . ' my dear [???] [???] it is [???] leaf ! there
were the [???] [???] on the barrels [???] as plain as plain . how it
came here [???] i can ' t imagine . for [???] ' s private use . i fancy . i never knew
that it went so far abroad . but it comes in handy now ? '

' it would [???] ' said [???] [???] ' if i had a pipe to go with it . alas [???] i lost
mine in moria [???] or before . is there no pipe in all your plunder ? '
' no [???] i am afraid not [???] ' said merry . ' we have not found any [???] not even
here in the [???] . [???] kept this dainty to himself . it seems . and i
don ' t think it would be any use knocking on the doors of orthanc to beg a
pipe of him ! we shall have to share pipes . as good friends must at a pinch . '
' half a moment ! ' said [???] . putting his hand inside the breast of his
jacket he pulled out a little soft wallet on a string . ' i keep a treasure or
two near my skin [???] as precious as rings to me . here ' s one : my old wooden
pipe . and here ' s another : an unused one . i have carried it a long way [???] [???]
though i don ' t know why . i never really expected to find any pipe - weed on
the journey [???] when my own ran out . but now it comes in useful after all . ' he
held up a small pipe with a wide [???] bowl [???] and handed it to [???] .
' does that settle the score between us ? ' he said . ' settle it ! ' cried [???] .
' most noble hobbit [???] it leaves me deep in your debt . '
' well [???] i am going back into the open air [???] to see what the wind and sky
are doing ! ' said legolas .
' we will come with you [???] ' said [???] .
they went out and seated themselves upon the piled stones before the
gateway . they could see far down into the valley now ; the mists were lifting
and floating away upon the breeze .
' now let us take our ease here for a little ! ' said [???] . ' we will
sit on the edge of ruin and talk [???] as [???] says [???] while he is busy
elsewhere . i feel a weariness such as i have seldom felt before . ' he wrapped
his grey cloak about him [???] hiding his mail - shirt [???] and stretched out his long
legs . then he lay back and sent from his lips a thin stream of smoke .
' look ! ' said [???] . ' strider the ranger has come back ! '
' he has never been away [???] ' said [???] . ' i am strider and d [???] [???] too [???]
and i belong both to [???] and the north . '
they smoked in silence for a while [???] and the sun shone on them ; [???]
into the valley from among white clouds high in the west . legolas lay still [???]
looking up at the sun and sky with steady eyes [???] and singing softly to
himself . at last he sat up . ' come now ! ' he said . ' time wears on [???] and the
mists are blowing away [???] or would if you strange folk did not wreathe
yourselves in smoke . what of the tale ? '
' well [???] my tale begins with waking up in the dark and finding myself all
strung - up in an orc - camp [???] ' said [???] . ' let me see [???] what is today ? '

' the fifth of march in the shire - reckoning [???] ' said [???] . [???] made
some calculations on his fingers . ' only nine days ago ! ' he said . 1 ' it seems
a year since we were caught . well [???] though half of it was like a bad dream [???] i
reckon that three very horrible days followed . merry will correct me [???] if i
forget anything important : i am not going into details : the whips and the
filth and stench and all that ; it does not bear remembering . ' with that he
[???] into an account of [???] ' s last fight and the orc - march from emyn
muil to the forest . the others nodded as the various points were fitted in
with their guesses .
' here are some treasures that you let fall [???] ' said [???] . ' you will be
glad to have them back . ' he loosened his belt from under his cloak and took
from it the two sheathed knives .
' well ! ' said merry . ' i never expected to see those again ! i marked a
few [???] with mine ; but ugl [???] k took them from us . how he glared ! at first i
thought he was going to stab me [???] but he threw the things away as if they
burned him . '
' and here also is your brooch [???] [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' i have kept it
safe [???] for it is a very precious thing . '
' i know [???] ' said [???] . ' it was a wrench to let it go ; but what else
could i do ? '
' nothing else [???] ' answered [???] . ' one who cannot cast away a treasure
at need is in fetters . you did rightly . '
' the cutting of the bands on your wrists [???] that was smart work ! ' said
[???] . ' luck served you there ; but you seized your chance with both hands [???]
one might say . '
' and set us a pretty riddle [???] ' said legolas . ' i wondered if you had
grown wings ! '
' unfortunately not [???] ' said [???] . ' but you did not know about
[???] . ' he [???] and said no more [???] leaving merry to tell of those
last horrible moments : the [???] hands [???] the hot breath [???] and the dreadful
strength of [???] ' s hairy arms .
' all this about the [???] of barad - dyr [???] [???] [???] rz as they call it [???] makes
me uneasy [???] ' said [???] . ' the dark lord already knew too much and his
servants also ; and [???] evidently sent some message across the river
after the quarrel . the red eye will be looking towards [???] . but [???]
at any rate is in a cleft stick of his own cutting . '
' yes [???] whichever side wins [???] his outlook is poor [???] ' said merry . ' things

began to go all wrong for him from the moment his [???] set foot in [???] . '
' we caught a glimpse of the old villain [???] or so [???] hints [???] ' said
[???] . ' on the edge of the forest . '
' when was that ? ' asked [???] .
' five nights ago [???] ' said [???] .
' let me see [???] ' said merry : ' five nights ago - now we come to a part of the
story you know nothing about . we met [???] that morning after the
battle ; and that night we were at [???] [???] one of his ent - houses . the
next morning we went to [???] [???] a gathering of ents [???] that is [???] and the
[???] thing i have ever seen in my life . it lasted all that day and the
next ; and we spent the nights with an ent called [???] . and then late in
the afternoon in the third day of their moot [???] the ents suddenly blew up . it
was amazing . the forest had felt as tense as if a [???] was brewing
inside it : then all at once it exploded . i wish you could have heard their
song as they marched . '
' if [???] n had heard it [???] he would be a hundred miles away by now [???] even
if he had had to run on his own legs [???] ' said [???] .
' though [???] be strong and hard [???] as cold as stone and bare as bone [???]
we go [???] we go [???] we go to war [???] to hew the stone and break the door !
there was very much more . a great deal of the song had no words [???] and
was like a music of horns and drums . it was very exciting . but i thought it
was only marching music and no more [???] just a song - - until i got here . i know
better now . '
' we came down over the last ridge into nan [???] [???] after night had
fallen [???] ' merry continued . ' it was then that i first had the feeling that the
forest itself was moving behind us . i thought i was dreaming an entish
dream [???] but [???] had noticed it too . we were both frightened ; but we did
not find out more about it until later .
' it was the [???] [???] or so the ents call them in [???] short language [???] .
[???] won ' t say much about them [???] but i think they are ents that have
become almost like trees [???] at least to look at . they stand here and there in
the wood or under its eaves [???] silent [???] watching endlessly over the trees ; but
deep in the darkest dales there are hundreds and hundreds of them [???] i
believe .
' there is a great power in them [???] and they seem able to wrap themselves
in shadow : it is difficult to see them moving . but they do . they can move
very quickly [???] if they are angry . you stand still looking at the weather [???]

maybe [???] or listening to the rustling of the wind [???] and then suddenly you find
that you are in the middle of a wood with great groping trees all around
you . they still have voices [???] and can speak with the ents - - that is why they
are called [???] [???] [???] says - - but they have become queer and wild .
danger ous . i should be terrified of meeting them [???] if there were no true ents
about to look after them .
' well [???] in the early night we crept down a long ravine into the upper
end of the [???] ' s vale [???] the ents with all their rustling [???] behind . we
could not see them [???] of course [???] but the whole air was full of creaking . it
was very dark [???] a cloudy night . they moved at a great speed as soon as they
had left the hills [???] and made a noise like a rushing wind . the moon did not
appear through the clouds [???] and not long after midnight there was a tall wood
all round the north side of [???] . there was no sign of enemies nor of
any challenge . there was a light gleaming from a high window in the tower [???]
that was all .
' [???] and a few more ents crept on [???] right round to within sight of
the great gates . [???] and i were with him . we were sitting on [???] ' s
shoulders [???] and i could feel the [???] [???] in him . but even when
they are roused [???] ents can be very [???] and patient . they stood still as
carved stones [???] breathing and listening .
' then all at once there was a tremendous stir . trumpets blared and the
walls of [???] echoed . we thought that we had been discovered [???] and that
battle was going to begin . but nothing of the sort . all [???] ' s people
were marching away . i don ' t know much about this war [???] or about the
horsemen
of [???] [???] but [???] seems to have meant to finish off the king and all his
men with one final blow . he emptied [???] . i saw the enemy go : endless
lines of marching [???] ; and troops of them mounted on great wolves . and
there were [???] of men [???] too . many of them carried torches [???] and in the
flare i could see their faces . most of them were ordinary men [???] rather tall
and dark - haired [???] and grim but not particularly evil - looking . but there were
some others that were horrible : man - high [???] but with [???] - faces [???] sallow [???]
leering [???] squint - eyed . do you know [???] they reminded me at once of that
[???] at bree : only he was not so obviously orc - like as most of these
were . '
' i thought of him too [???] ' said [???] . ' we had many of these half - [???]
to deal with at helm ' s deep . it seems plain now that that [???] was a

spy of [???] ' s ; but whether he was working with the black riders [???] or for
[???] alone [???] i do not know . it is difficult with these evil folk to know
when they are in league [???] and when they are cheating one another . '
' well [???] of all sorts together [???] there must have been ten thousand at the
very least [???] ' said merry . ' they took an hour to pass out of the gates . some
went off down the highway to the fords [???] and some turned away [???] and went
eastward . a bridge has been built down there [???] about a mile away [???] where the
river runs in a very deep channel . you could see i t now [???] if you stood up .
they were all singing with harsh voices [???] and laughing [???] making a hideous din .
i thought things looked very black for [???] . but [???] did not move . he
said : ' my business is with [???] tonight [???] with rock and stone . '
' but [???] though i could not see what was happening in the dark [???] i believe
that [???] began to move south [???] as soon as the gates were shut again . their
business was with [???] i think . they were far down the valley in the
morning ; or any rate there was a shadow there that one couldn ' t see through .
' as soon as [???] had sent off all his army [???] our turn came . [???]
put us down [???] and went up to the gates [???] and began hammering on the doors [???] and
calling for [???] . there was no answer [???] except arrows and stones from the
walls . but arrows are no use against ents . they hurt them [???] of course [???] and
[???] them : like stinging flies . but an ent can be stuck as full of
orc - arrows as a pin - cushion [???] and take no serious harm . they cannot be
poisoned [???] for one thing ; and their skin seems to be very thick [???] and tougher
than bark . it takes a very heavy axe - stroke to wound them seriously . they
don ' t like axes . but there would have to be a great many axe - men to one ent :
a man that hacks once at an ent never gets a chance of a second blow . a
punch from an ent - fist [???] up iron like thin tin .
' when [???] had got a few arrows in him [???] he began to warm up [???] to
get [???] [???] hasty [???] [???] as he would say . he let out a great hoom - hom [???] and a
dozen more ents came striding up . an angry ent is terrifying . their fingers [???]
and their toes [???] just freeze on to rock ; and they tear it up like
bread - crust . it was like watching the work of great tree - roots in a hundred
years [???] all packed into a few moments .
' they pushed [???] pulled [???] tore [???] shook [???] and hammered ; and clang - bang [???]
crash - crack [???] in five minutes they had these huge gates just lying in ruin ;
and some were already beginning to eat into the walls [???] like [???] in a
sand - pit . i don ' t know what [???] thought was happening ; but anyway he
did

not know how to deal with it . his [???] may have been falling off lately [???]
of course ; but anyway i think he has not much grit [???] not much plain courage
alone in a tight place without a lot of slaves and machines and things [???] if
you know what i mean . very different from old [???] . i wonder if his fame
was not all along mainly due to his [???] in settling at [???] . '
' no [???] ' said [???] . ' once he was as great as his fame made h im . his
knowledge was deep [???] his thought was subtle [???] and his hands marvellously
skilled ; and he had a power over the minds of others . the wise he could
persuade [???] and the smaller folk he could daunt . that power he certainly still
keeps . there are not many in middle - earth that i should say were safe [???] if
they were left alone to talk with him [???] even now when he has suffered a
defeat . [???] [???] [???] [???] and [???] [???] perhaps [???] now that his wickedness has
been laid bare [???] but very few others . '
' the ents are safe [???] ' said [???] . ' he seems at one time to have got
round them [???] but never again . and anyway he did not understand them ; and he
made the great mistake of leaving them out of his calculations . he had no
plan for them [???] and there was no time to make any [???] once they had set to work .
as soon as our attack began [???] the few remaining rats in [???] started
bolting through every hole that the ents made . the ents let the men go [???]
after they had questioned them [???] two or three dozen only down at this end . i
don ' t think many orc - folk [???] of any size [???] escaped . not from the [???] : there
was a wood full of them all round [???] by that time [???] as well as those
that had gone down the valley .
' when the ents had reduced a large part of the southern walls to
rubbish [???] and what was left of his people had bolted and deserted him [???]
[???] fled in a panic . he seems to have been at the gates when we arrived :
i expect he came to watch his [???] army march out . when the ents broke
their way in [???] he left in a hurry . they did not spot him at first . but the
night had opened out [???] and there was a great light of stars [???] quite enough for
ents to see by [???] and suddenly [???] gave a cry [???] the tree - killer [???] the
tree - killer ! [???] [???] is a gentle creature [???] but he hates [???] all the
more fiercely for that : his people suffered cruelly from orc - axes . he leapt
down the path from the inner gate [???] and he can move like a wind when he is
roused . there was a pale figure hurrying away in and out of the shadows of
the pillars [???] and it had nearly reached the stairs to the tower - door . but it
was a near thing . [???] was so hot after him [???] that he was within a step
or two of being caught and strangled when he slipped in through the door .

' when [???] was safe back in orthanc [???] it was not long before he set
some of his precious machinery to work . by that time there were many ents
inside [???] : some had followed [???] [???] and others had burst in from
the north and east ; they were roaming about and doing a great deal of
damage . suddenly up came fires and foul fumes : the vents and shafts all over
the plain began to spout and belch . several of the ents got [???] and
[???] . one of them [???] [???] i think he was called [???] a very tall
handsome ent [???] got caught in a spray of some liquid fire and burned like a
torch : a horrible sight .
' that sent them mad . i thought that they had been really roused before ;
but i was wrong . i saw what it was like at last . it was [???] . they
roared and boomed and trumpeted [???] until stones began to crack and fall at the
mere noise of them . merry and i lay on the ground and stuffed our cloaks
into our ears . round and round the rock of orthanc the ents went striding
and storming like a howling gale [???] breaking pillars [???] hurling [???] of
[???] down the shafts [???] tossing up huge [???] of stone into the air like
leaves . the tower was in the middle of a spinning [???] . i saw iron
posts and blocks of [???] go rocketing up hundreds of feet [???] and smash
against the windows of orthanc . but [???] kept his head . he had not had
any burns [???] luckily . he did not want his folk to hurt themselves in their
fury [???] and he did not want [???] to escape out of some hole in the
confusion . many of the ents were hurling themselves against the
orthanc - rock ; but that defeated them . it is very smooth and hard . some
[???] is in it [???] perhaps [???] older and stronger than [???] ' s . anyway they
could not get a grip on it [???] or make a crack in it ; and they were bruising
and wounding themselves against it . ' so [???] went out into the ring and
shouted . his enormous voice rose above all the din . there was a dead
silence [???] suddenly . in it we heard a shrill laugh from a high window in the
tower . that had a queer effect on the ents . they had been boiling over ; now
they became cold [???] grim as ice [???] and quiet . they left the plain and gathered
round [???] [???] standing quite still . he spoke to them for a little in
their own language ; i think he was telling them of a plan he had made in his
old head long before . then they just faded silently away in the grey light .
day was [???] by that time .
' they set a watch on the tower [???] i believe [???] but the watchers were so
well hidden in shadows and kept so still [???] that i could not see them . the
others went away north . all that day they were busy [???] out of sight . most of

the time we were left alone . it was a dreary day ; and we wandered about a
bit [???] though we kept out of the view of the windows of orthanc [???] as much as we
could : they stared at us so threateningly . a good deal of the time we spent
looking for something to eat . and also we sat and talked [???] wondering what was
happening away south in [???] [???] and what had become of all the rest of our
company . every now and then we could hear in the distance the rattle and
fall of stone [???] and [???] noises echoing in the hills .
' in the afternoon we walked round the circle [???] and went to have a look
at what was going on . there was a great shadowy wood of [???] at the head
of the valley [???] and another round the northern wall . we did not dare to go
in . but there was a rending [???] tearing noise of work going on inside . ents and
[???] were digging great pits and trenches [???] and making great [???] and
dams [???] gathering all the waters of the isen and every other spring and stream
that they could find . we left them to it .
' at [???] [???] came back to the gate . he was humming a nd [???] to
himself [???] and seemed pleased . he stood and stretched his great arms and legs
and breathed deep . i asked him if he was tired .
' [???] tired ? [???] he said [???] [???] tired ? well no [???] not tired [???] but stiff . i need a
good draught of [???] . we have worked hard ; we have done more
stone - cracking and earth - gnawing today than we have done in many a long
year
before . but it is nearly finished . when night falls do not linger near this
gate or in the old tunnel ! water may come through - and it will be foul water
for a while [???] until all the filth of [???] is washed away . then isen can
run clean again . [???] he began to pull down a bit more of the walls [???] in a
leisurely sort of way [???] just to amuse himself .
' we were just wondering where it wou ld be safe to lie and get some
sleep [???] when the most amazing thing of all happened . there was the sound of a
rider coming swiftly up the road . merry and i lay quiet [???] and [???] hid
himself in the shadows under the arch . suddenly a great horse came striding
up [???] like a flash of silver . it was already dark . but i could see the rider ' s
face clearly : it seemed to shine [???] and all his clothes were white . i just sat
up [???] staring [???] with my mouth open . i tried to call out [???] and couldn ' t .
' there was no need . he halted just by us and looked down at us .
' [???] ! ' i said at last . but my voice was only a whisper . did he say :
[???] hullo [???] [???] ! this is a pleasant surprise ! [???] ? no [???] indeed ! he said : [???] get up [???]
you tom - fool of a took ! where [???] in the name of wonder [???] in all this ruin is

[???] ? i want him . quick ! [???]
' [???] heard his voice and came out of the shadows at once ; and
there was a strange meeting . i was surprised [???] because neither of them seemed
surprised at all . [???] obviously expected to find [???] here ; and
[???] might almost have been loitering about near the gates on purpose
to meet him . yet we had told the old ent all about moria . but then i
remembered a queer look he gave us at the time . i can only suppose that he
had seen [???] or had some news of him [???] but would not say anything in a
hurry . [???] don ' t be hasty [???] is his motto ; but nobody [???] not even elves [???] will say
much about [???] ' s movements when he is not there .
' [???] hoom ! [???] ! [???] said [???] . [???] i am glad you have come . wood and
water [???] stock and stone [???] i can master ; but there is a [???] to manage here . [???]
' [???] [???] [???] [???] said [???] . [???] i need your help . you have done much [???] but
i need more . i have about ten thousand [???] to manage . [???]
' then those two went off and had a council together in some corner . it
must have seemed very hasty to [???] [???] for [???] was in a tremendous
hurry [???] and was already talking at a great pace [???] before they passed out of
hearing . they were only away a matter of minutes [???] perhaps a quarter of an
hour . then [???] came back to us [???] and he seemed relieved [???] almost merry . he
did say he was glad to see us [???] then .
' [???] but [???] [???] [???] i cried [???] [???] where have you been ? and have you seen the
others ? [???]
' [???] wherever i have been [???] i am back [???] [???] he answered in the [???] [???]
manner . [???] yes [???] i have seen some of the others . but news must wait . this is a
perilous night [???] and i must ride fast . but the dawn may be brighter ; and if
so [???] we shall meet again . take care of yourselves [???] and keep away from
orthanc ! good - bye ! [???]
' [???] was very thoughtful after [???] had gone . he had evidently
learnt a lot in a short time and was digesting it . he looked at us and said :
[???] hm [???] well [???] i find you are not such hasty folk as i thought . you said much
less than you might [???] and not more than you should . hm [???] this is a bundle of
news and no mistake ! well [???] now [???] must get busy again . [???]
' before he went [???] we got a little news out of him ; and it did not cheer
us up at all . but for the moment we thought more about you three than about
[???] and sam [???] or about poor [???] . for we gathered that there was a great
battle going on [???] or soon would be [???] and that you were in it [???] and might never
come out of it .

' [???] [???] will help [???] [???] said [???] . then he went away and we did not
see him again until this morning .
' it was deep night . we lay on top of a pile of stone [???] and could see
nothing beyond it . mist or shadows blotted out everything like a great
blanket all round us . the air seemed hot and heavy ; and it was full of
rustlings [???] [???] [???] and a murmur like voices passing . i think that
hundreds more of the [???] must have been passing by to help in the battle .
later there was a great rumble of thunder away south [???] and flashes of
lightning far away across [???] . every now and then we could see
mountain - peaks [???] miles and miles away [???] stab out suddenly [???] black and white [???]
and then vanish . and behind us there were noises like thunder in hills [???] but
different . at times the whole valley echoed .
' it must have been about midnight when the ents broke the dams and
poured all the gathered waters through a gap in the northern wall [???] down into
[???] . the huorn - dark had passed [???] and the thunder had rolled away . the
moon was sinking behind the western mountains .
' [???] began to fill up with black creeping streams and [???] . they
glittered in the last light of the moon [???] as they spread over the plain .
every now and then the waters found their way down into some shaft or
[???] . great white steams [???] up . smoke rose in billows . there were
[???] and gusts of fire . one great coil of vapour went whirling up [???]
twisting round and round orthanc [???] until it looked like a tall peak of cloud [???]
fiery underneath and [???] above . and still more water poured in [???] until at
last [???] looked like a huge flat saucepan [???] all steaming and [???] . '
' we saw a cloud of smoke and steam from the south last night when we
came to the mouth of nan [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' we feared that [???]
was
brewing some new devilry for us . '
' not he ! ' said [???] . ' he was probably choking and not laughing any
more . by the morning [???] yesterday morning [???] the water had sunk down into all
the holes [???] and there was a dense fog . we took [???] in that guardroom over
there ; and we had rather a fright . the lake began to [???] and pour out
through the old tunnel [???] and the water was rapidly rising up the steps . we
thought we were going to get caught like [???] in a hole ; but we found a
winding stair at the back of the store - room that brought us out on top of
the arch . it was a [???] to get out [???] as the passages had been cracked and
half blocked with fallen stone near the top . there we sat high up above the

floods and watched the drowning of [???] . the ents kept on pouring in
more water [???] till all the fires were quenched and every cave filled . the fogs
slowly gathered together and steamed up into a huge [???] of cloud : it
must have been a mile high . in the evening there was a great [???] over
the eastern hills ; and then the sunset was blotted out by a thick [???] on
the mountain - sides . it all went very quiet . a few wolves howled mournfully [???]
far away . the ents stopped the inflow in the night [???] and sent the isen back
into its old course . and that was the end of it all .
' since then the water has been sinking again . there must be outlets
somewhere from the caves underneath [???] i think . if [???] peeps out of any of
his windows [???] it must look an [???] [???] dreary mess . we felt very lonely . not
even a visible ent to talk to in all the ruin ; and no news . we spent the
night up on top there above the arch [???] and it was cold and damp and we did
not sleep . we had a feeling that anything might happen at any minute .
[???] is still in his tower . there was a noise in the night like a wind
coming up the valley . i think the ents and [???] that had been away came
back then ; but where they have all gone to now [???] i don ' t know . it was a
misty [???] moisty morning when we climbed down and looked round again [???]
and
nobody was about . and that is about all there is to tell . it seems almost
peaceful now after all the [???] . and safer too [???] somehow [???] since [???]
came back . i could sleep ! '
they all fell silent for a while . [???] re - filled his pipe . ' there is
one thing i wonder about [???] ' he said as he lit it with his flint and tinder :
' [???] . you told [???] he was with [???] . how did he get there ? '
' oh yes [???] i forgot about him [???] ' said [???] . ' he did not get here till
this morning . we had just lit the fire and had some breakfast when [???]
appeared again . we heard him [???] and calling our names outside .
' [???] i have just come round to see how you are faring [???] my lads [???] ' he said ;
' and to give you some news . [???] have come back . all ' s well ; aye very well
indeed ! [???] he laughed [???] and slapped his thighs . [???] no more [???] in [???] [???] no
more axes ! and there will be folk coming up from the south before the day is
old ; some that you may be glad to see . [???]
' he had hardly said that [???] when we heard the sound of [???] on the road .
we rushed out before the gates [???] and i stood and stared [???] half expecting to
see strider and [???] come riding up at the head of an army . but out of
the mist there rode a man on an old tired horse ; and he looked a queer

twisted sort of creature himself . there was no one else . when he came . out
of the mist and suddenly saw all the ruin and wreckage in front of him [???] he
sat and gaped [???] and his face went almost green . he was so [???] that he
did not seem to notice us at first . when he did [???] he gave a cry [???] and tried to
turn his horse round and ride off . but [???] took three strides [???] put out
a long arm [???] and lifted him out of the saddle . his horse bolted in terror [???]
and he grovelled on the ground . he said he was [???] [???] friend and counsellor
of the king [???] and had been sent with important messages from [???] to
[???] .
' [???] no one else would dare to ride through the open land [???] so full of foul
[???] [???] [???] he said [???] [???] so i was sent . and i have had a perilous journey [???] and i am
hungry and weary . i fled far north out of my way [???] pursued by wolves . [???]
' i caught the sidelong looks he gave to [???] [???] and i said to myself
[???] liar [???] . [???] looked at him in his long slow way for several minutes [???]
till the wretched man was [???] on the floor . then at last he said : [???] ha [???]
hm [???] i was expecting you [???] master [???] . [???] the man started a t that name .
[???] [???] got here first . so i know as much about you as i need [???] and i know
what to do with you . put all the rats in one trap [???] said [???] ; and i will .
i am the master of [???] now [???] but [???] is locked in his tower ; and you
can go there and give him all the messages that you can think of . [???]
' [???] let me go [???] let me go ! [???] said [???] . [???] i know the way . [???]
' [???] you knew the way [???] i don ' t doubt [???] [???] said [???] . [???] but things have
changed here a little . go and see ! [???]
' he let [???] go [???] and he limped off through the arch with us close
behind [???] until he came inside the ring and could see all the floods that lay
between him and orthanc . then he turned to us .
' [???] let me go away ! [???] he whined . [???] let me go away ! my messages are useless
now . [???]
' [???] they are indeed [???] [???] said [???] . [???] but you have only two choices : to
stay with me until [???] and your master arrive ; or to cross the water .
which will you have ? [???]
' the man shivered at the mention of his master [???] and put a foot into the
water ; but he drew back . [???] i cannot swim [???] [???] he said .
' [???] the water is not deep [???] [???] said [???] . [???] it is dirty [???] but that will
not harm you [???] master [???] . in you go now ! [???]
' with that the wretch [???] off into the flood . it rose up nearly
to his neck before he got too far away for me to see him . the last i saw of

him was [???] to some old barrel or piece of wood . but [???] waded
after him [???] and watched his progress .
' [???] well [???] he has gone in [???] [???] he said when he returned . [???] i saw him [???]
up the steps like a [???] rat . there is someone in the tower still : a
hand came out and pulled him in . so there he is [???] and i hope the welcome is
to his liking . now i must go and wash myself clean of the slime . i ' ll be
away up on the north side [???] if anyone wants to see me . there is no clean
water down here fit for an ent to drink . or to bathe in . so i will ask you
two lads to keep a watch at the gate for the folk that are coming . there ' ll
be the lord of the fields of [???] [???] mark you ! you must welcome him as well
as you know how : his men have fought a great fight with the [???] . maybe [???] you
know the right fashion of men ' s words for such a lord [???] better than ents .
there have been many lords in the green fields in my time [???] and i have never
learned their speech or their names . they will be wanting man - food [???] and you
know all about that [???] i guess . so find what you think is fit for a king to
eat [???] if you can . [???] and that is the end of the story . though i should like to
know who this [???] is . was he really the king ' s counsellor ? '
' he was [???] ' said [???] ; ' and also [???] ' s spy and servant in [???] .
fate has not been kinder to him than he deserves . the sight of the ruin of
all that he thought so strong and [???] must have been almost
punishment enough . but i fear that worse [???] him . '
' yes [???] i don ' t suppose [???] sent him to orthanc out of kindness [???] '
said merry . ' he seemed rather grimly delighted with the business and was
laughing to himself when he went to get his bathe and drink . we spent a busy
time after that [???] searching the [???] [???] and [???] about . we found two or
three store - rooms in different places nearby [???] above the flood - level . but
[???] sent some ents down [???] and they carried off a great deal of the
stuff .
' [???] we want man - food for twenty - five [???] [???] the ents said [???] so you can see that
somebody had counted your company carefully before you arrived . you three
were evidently meant to go with the great people . but you would not have
fared any better . we kept as good as we sent [???] i promise you . better [???] because
we sent no drink .
' [???] what about drink ? [???] i said to the ents .
' [???] there is water of isen [???] [???] they said [???] [???] and that is good enough for ents
and men . [???] but i hope that the ents may have found time to brew some of their
draughts from the mountain - springs [???] and we shall see [???] ' s beard curling

when he returns . after the ents had gone [???] we felt tired [???] and hungry . but we
did not grumble - - our labours had been well rewarded . it was through our
search for man - food that [???] discovered the prize of all the [???] [???]
those [???] barrels . [???] pipe - weed is better after food [???] [???] said [???] ;
that is how the situation arose . '
' we understand it all perfectly now [???] ' said [???] .
' all except one thing [???] ' said [???] : ' leaf from the [???] in
[???] . the more i consider it [???] the more curious i find it . i have never
been in [???] [???] but i have journeyed in this land [???] and i know well the
empty countries that lie between [???] and the shire . neither goods nor folk
have passed that way for many a long year [???] not openly . [???] had secret
dealings with someone in the shire [???] i guess . [???] may be found in
other houses than king [???] ' s . was there a date on the barrels ? '
' yes [???] ' said [???] . ' it was the [???] crop [???] that is last year ' s ; no [???] the
year before [???] of course [???] now : a good year . '
' ah well [???] whatever evil was afoot is over now [???] i hope ; or else it is
beyond our reach at pr esent [???] ' said [???] . ' yet i think i shall mention it
to [???] [???] small matter though it may seem among his great affairs . '
' i wonder what he is doing [???] ' said merry . ' the afternoon is getting on .
let us go and look round ! you can enter [???] now at any rate [???] strider [???]
if you want to . but it is not a very cheerful sight . '




chapter 10 . the voice of [???]



they passed through the ruined tunnel and stood upon a heap of stones [???]
gazing at the dark rock of orthanc [???] and its many windows [???] a menace still in
the desolation that lay all about it . the waters had now nearly all
[???] . here and there gloomy [???] remained [???] covered with scum and
wreckage ; but most of the wide circle was bare again [???] a wilderness of slime
and tumbled rock [???] pitted with blackened holes [???] and dotted with posts and
pillars leaning drunkenly this way and that . at the rim of the [???]
bowl there lay vast mounds and [???] [???] like the [???] cast up by a great
storm ; and beyond them the green and tangled valley ran up into the long
ravine between the dark arms of the mountains . across the waste they saw
riders picking their way ; they were coming from the north side [???] and already
they were drawing near to orthanc .
' there is [???] [???] and [???] and his men ! ' said legolas . ' let us go
and meet them ! '
' walk warily ! ' said merry . ' there are loose [???] that may tilt up and
throw you down into a pit [???] if you don ' t take care . '
they followed what was left of the road from the gates to orthanc [???]
going slowly [???] for the flag - stones were cracked and slimed . the riders [???]
seeing them approach [???] halted under the shadow of the rock and waited for
them . [???] rode forward to meet them .
' well [???] [???] and i have had some interesting discussions [???] and made
a few plans [???] ' he said ; ' and we have all had some much - needed rest . now we
must be going on again . i hope you companions have all rested [???] too [???] and
refreshed yourselves ? '
' we have [???] ' said merry . ' but our discussions began and ended in smoke .
still we feel less ill - disposed towards [???] than we did . '
' do you indeed ? ' said [???] . ' well [???] i do not . i have now a last task
to do before i go : i must pay [???] a farewell visit . dangerous [???] and
probably u seless ; but it must be done . those of you who wish may come with
me - - but beware ! and do not jest ! this is not the time for it . '
' i will come [???] ' said [???] . ' i wish to see him and learn if he really
looks like you . '
' and how will you learn that [???] master dwarf ? ' said [???] . ' [???]

could look like me in your eyes [???] if it suited his purpose with you . and are
you yet wise enough to detect all his counterfeits ? well [???] we shall see [???]
perhaps . he may be shy of showing himself before many different eyes
together . but i have ordered all the ents to remove themselves from sight [???]
so perhaps we shall persuade him to come out . '
' what ' s the danger ? ' asked [???] . ' will he shoot at us [???] and pour fire
out of the windows ; or can he put a spell on us from a distance ? '
' the last is most likely [???] if you ride to his door with a light heart [???] '
said [???] . ' but there is no knowing what he can do [???] or may choose to try .
a wild beast cornered is not safe to approach . and [???] has powers you do
not guess . beware of his voice ! '
they came now to the foot of orthanc . it was black [???] and the rock
gleamed as if it were wet . the many faces of the stone had sharp edges as
though they had been newly [???] . a few [???] . and small flake - like
[???] near the base [???] were all the marks that it bore of the fury of the
ents .
on the eastern side [???] in the angle of two piers [???] there was a great door [???]
high above the ground ; and over it was a shuttered window [???] opening upon a
[???] hedged with iron bars . up to the [???] of the door there mounted
a flight of twenty - seven broad stairs [???] hewn by some unknown art of the same
black stone . this was the only entrance to the tower ; but many tall windows
were cut with deep [???] in the climbing walls : far up they peered like
little eyes in the sheer faces of the horns .
at the foot of the stairs [???] and the king [???] . ' i will go
up [???] ' said [???] . ' i have been in orthanc and i know my peril . '
' and i too will go up [???] ' said the king . ' i am old [???] and fear no peril any
more . i wish to speak with the enemy who has done me so much wrong .
jomer
shall come with me [???] and see that my aged feet do not falter . '
' as you will [???] ' said [???] . ' [???] shall come with me . let the
others [???] us at the foot of the stairs . they will hear and see enough [???] if
there is anything to hear or see . '
' nay ! ' said [???] . ' legolas and i wish for a closer view . we alone here
represent our kindred . we also will come behind . '
' come then ! ' said [???] [???] and with that he climbed the steps [???] and
[???] went beside him .
the riders of [???] sat [???] upon their horses [???] on either side of

the stair [???] and looked up darkly at the great tower [???] fearing what might
befall their lord . merry and [???] sat on the bottom step [???] feeling both
[???] and unsafe .
' half a sticky mile from here to the gate ! ' muttered [???] . ' i wish i
could slip off back to the guardroom [???] ! what did we come for ? we are
not wanted . '
[???] stood before the door of orthanc and beat on it with his staff .
it rang with a hollow sound . ' [???] [???] [???] ! ' he cried in a loud
commanding voice . ' [???] come forth ! '
for some time there was no answer . at last the window above the door
was [???] [???] hut no figure could be seen at its dark opening .
' who is it ? ' said a voice . ' what do you wish ? '
[???] started . ' i know that voice [???] ' he said [???] ' and i curse the day
when i first listened to it . '
' go and fetch [???] [???] since you have become his footman [???] [???]
[???] ! ' said [???] . ' and do not waste our time ! '
the window closed . they waited . suddenly another voice spoke [???] low and
[???] [???] its very sound an enchantment . those who listened unwarily to
that voice could seldom report the words that they heard ; and if they did [???]
they wondered [???] for little power remained in them . mostly they remembered
only that it was a delight to hear the voice speaking [???] all that it said
seemed wise and reasonable [???] and desire awoke in them by swift agreement to
seem wise themselves . when others spoke they seemed harsh and uncouth
by
contrast ; and if they gainsaid the voice [???] anger was kindled in the hearts of
those under the spell . fur some the spell lasted only while the voice spoke
to them [???] and when it spake to another they smiled [???] as men do who see through
a [???] ' s trick while others gape at it . for many the sound of the voice
alone was enough to hold them [???] ; but for those whom it conquered
the spell endured when they were far away . and ever they heard that soft
voice whispering and urging them . but none were [???] ; none [???] its
pleas and its commands without an effort of mind and will [???] so long as its
master had control of it .
' well ? ' it said now with gentle question . ' why must you disturb my
rest ? will you give me no peace at all by night or day ? ' its tone was that
of a kindly heart [???] by injuries [???] .
they looked up [???] astonished [???] for they had heard no sound of his coming ;

and they saw a figure standing at the rail [???] looking down upon them : an old
man [???] [???] in a great cloak [???] the colour of which was not easy to tell [???] for
it changed if they moved their eyes or if he stirred . his face was long [???]
with a high forehead [???] he had deep darkling eyes [???] hard to fathom [???] though the
look that they now bore was grave and [???] [???] and a little weary . his
hair and beard were white [???] but [???] of black still showed about his lips
and ears .
' like [???] and yet unlike [???] ' muttered [???] .
' but come now [???] ' said the soft voice . ' two at least of you i know by
name . [???] i know too well to have much hope that he seeks help or
counsel here . but you [???] [???] lord of the mark of [???] are declared by
your noble devices [???] and still more by the fair countenance of the house of
[???] . o worthy son of [???] the thrice - renowned ! why have you not
come
before [???] and as a friend ? much have i desired to see you [???] mightiest king of
western lands [???] and especially in these latter years [???] to save you from the
unwise and evil counsels that beset you ! is it yet too late ? despite the
injuries that have been done to me [???] in which the men of [???] [???] alas ! have
had some part [???] still i would save you [???] and deliver you from the ruin that
draws nigh [???] [???] if you ride upon this road which you have taken .
indeed i alone can aid you now . '
[???] opened his mouth as if to speak [???] but he said nothing . he looked
up at the face of [???] with its dark solemn eyes bent down upon him [???] and
then to [???] at his side ; and he seemed to [???] . [???] made no
sign ; but stood silent as stone [???] as one waiting patiently for some call that
has not yet come . the riders stirred at first [???] murmuring with approval of
the words of [???] ; and then they too were silent [???] as men spell - bound . it
seemed to them that [???] had never spoken so fair and [???] to their
lord . rough and proud now seemed all his dealings with [???] . and over
their hearts crept a shadow [???] the fear of a great danger : the end of the mark
in a darkness to which [???] was driving them [???] while [???] stood beside
a door of escape [???] holding it half open so that a ray of light came through .
there was a heavy silence .
it was [???] the dwarf who broke in suddenly . ' the words of this [???]
stand on their heads [???] ' he growled [???] gripping the handle of his axe . ' in the
language of orthanc help means ruin [???] and saving means slaying [???] that is
plain . but we do not come here to beg . '

' peace ! ' said [???] [???] and for a fleeting moment his voice was less
suave [???] and a light [???] in his eyes and was gone . ' i do not speak to
you yet [???] [???] [???] ' s son [???] ' he said . ' far away is your home and small
concern of yours are the troubles of this land . but it was not by design of
your own that you became [???] in them [???] and so i will not blame such
part as you have played - a valiant one [???] i doubt not . but i pray you [???] allow me
first to speak with the king of [???] [???] my neighbour [???] and once my friend .
' what have you to say [???] [???] king ? will you have peace with me [???] and
all the aid that my knowledge [???] founded in long years [???] can bring ? shall we
make our counsels together against evil days [???] and repair our injuries with
such good will that our estates shall both come to fairer flower than ever
before ? '
still [???] did not answer . whether he strove with anger or doubt
none could say . jomer spoke .
' lord [???] hear me ! ' he said . ' now we feel the peril that we were warned
of . have we ridden forth to victory [???] only to stand at last amazed by an old
liar with honey on his forked tongue ? so would the trapped wolf speak to the
hounds [???] if he could . what aid can he give to you [???] forsooth ? all he desires
is to escape from his plight . but will you parley with this dealer in
treachery and murder ? remember [???] at the fords [???] and the grave of
[???]
in helm ' s deep ! '
' if we speak of poisoned tongues what shall we say of yours [???] young
serpent ? ' said [???] [???] and the flash of his anger was now plain to see .
' but come [???] jomer [???] jomund ' s son ! ' he went on in his soft voice again . to
every man h part . valour in arms is yours [???] and you win high honour thereby .
slay whom your lord names as enemies [???] and be content . meddle not in [???]
which you do not understand . but maybe . if you become a king [???] you will find
that he must choose his friends with care . the friendship of [???] and the
power of orthanc cannot be lightly thrown aside [???] whatever grievances [???] real
or fancied [???] may lie behind . you have won a battle but not a war and that
with help on which you cannot count again . you may find the shadow of the
wood at your own door next : it is wayward [???] and senseless [???] and has no love
for men .
' but my lord of [???] [???] am i to be called a murderer [???] because valiant
men have fallen in battle ? if you go to war [???] needlessly [???] for i did not
desire it [???] then men will be slain . but if i am a murderer on that account [???]

then all the house of [???] is stained with murder ; for they have fought many
wars [???] and assailed many who defied them . yet with some they have afterwards
made peace [???] none the worse for being politic . i say [???] [???] king : shall we
have peace and friendship [???] you and i ? it is ours to command '
' we will have peace [???] ' said [???] at last thickly and with an effort .
several of the riders cried out gladly . [???] held up his hand . ' yes [???] we
will have peace [???] ' he said [???] now in a clear voice [???] ' we will have peace [???] when
you and all your works have perished - - and the works of your dark master to
whom you would deliver us . you are a liar . [???] [???] and a corrupter of men ' s
hearts . you hold out your hand to me [???] and i perceive only a finger of the
claw of [???] . cruel and cold ! even if your war on me was just as it was
not [???] for were you ten times as wise you would have no right to rule me and
mine for your own profit as you desired - - even so [???] what will you say of
your torches in westfold and the children that lie dead there ? and they
hewed [???] ' s body before the gates of the [???] [???] after he was dead .
when
you hang from a [???] at your window for the sport of your own crows [???] i
will have peace with you and orthanc . so much for the house of [???] . a
lesser son of great sires am i [???] but i do not need to lick your fingers . turn
[???] . but i fear your voice has lost its charm . '
the riders gazed up at [???] like men startled out of a dream . harsh
as an old raven ' s their master ' s voice sounded in their ears after the music
of [???] . but [???] for a while was beside himself with wrath . he leaned
over the rail as if he would smite the king with his staff . to some suddenly
it seemed that they saw a snake coiling itself to strike .
' [???] and crows ! ' he [???] [???] and they [???] at the hideous
change . ' dotard ! what is the house of [???] but a thatched barn where
[???] drink in the reek [???] and their brats roll on the floor among the
dogs ? too long have they escaped the [???] themselves . but the noose comes [???]
slow in the drawing [???] tight and hard in the end . hang if you will ! ' now his
voice changed [???] as he slowly mastered himself . ' i know not why i have had the
patience to speak to you . for i need you not [???] nor your little band of
[???] [???] as swift to fly as to advance [???] [???] horsemaster . long ago i
offered you a state beyond your merit and your wit . i have offered it again [???]
so that those whom you [???] may clearly see the choice of roads . you give
me brag and abuse . so be it . go back to your huts !
' but you [???] [???] ! for you at least i am grieved [???] feeling for your

shame . how comes it that you can endure such company ? for you are proud [???]
[???] - and not without reason [???] having a noble mind and eyes that look both
deep and far . even now will you not listen to my counsel ? '
[???] stirred [???] and looked up . ' what have you to say that you did not
say at our last meeting ? ' he asked . ' or [???] perhaps [???] you have things to unsay ? '
[???] paused . ' unsay ? ' he mused [???] as if puzzled . ' unsay ? i endeavoured
to advise you for your own good [???] but you scarcely listened . you are proud
and do not love advice [???] having indeed a store of your own wisdom . but on
that occasion you erred [???] i think [???] [???] my intentions wilfully . i
fear that in my eagerness to persuade you [???] i lost patience . and indeed i
regret it . for i bore you no ill - will ; and even now i bear none [???] though you
return to me in the company of the violent and the ignorant . how should i ?
are we not both members of a high and ancient order [???] most excellent in
middle - earth ? our friendship would profit us both alike . much we could still
accomplish together [???] to heal the disorders of the world . let us understand
one another [???] and dismiss from thought these lesser folk ! let them wait on
our [???] ! for the common good i am willing to redress the past [???] and to
receive you . will you not consult with me ? will you not come up ? '
so great was the power that [???] exerted in this last effort that
none that stood within hearing were [???] . but now the spell was wholly
different . they heard the gentle remonstrance of a kindly king with an
erring but much - loved minister . but they were shut out [???] listening at a door
to words not meant for them : ill - mannered children or stupid servants
[???] the [???] discourse of their elders [???] and wondering how it
would affect their lot . of [???] mould these two were made : reverend and
wise . it was [???] that they should make alliance . [???] would ascend
into the tower [???] to discuss deep things beyond their comprehension in the
high chambers of orthanc . the door would be closed [???] and they would be left
outside [???] dismissed to [???] allotted work or punishment . even in the mind of
[???] the thought took shape [???] like a shadow of doubt : ' he will betray us ;
he will go - - we shall be lost . '
then [???] laughed . the fantasy vanished like a puff of smoke .
' [???] [???] [???] ! ' said [???] still laughing . ' [???] [???] you missed
your path in life . you should have been the king ' s jester and earned your
bread [???] and stripes too [???] by [???] his counsellors . ah me ! ' he paused [???]
getting the better of his mirth . ' understand one another ? i fear i am beyond
your comprehension . but you [???] [???] [???] i understand now too well . i keep a

clearer memory of your arguments [???] and deeds [???] than you suppose . when last i
visited you [???] you were the jailor of [???] [???] and there i was to be sent . nay [???]
the guest who has escaped from the roof [???] will think twice before he comes
back in by the door . nay [???] i do not think i will come up . but listen [???]
[???] [???] for the last time ! will you not come down ? [???] has proved less
strong than your hope and fancy made it . so may other things in which you
still have trust . would it not be well to leave it for a while ? to turn to
new things [???] perhaps ? think well [???] [???] ! will you not come down ? '
a shadow passed over [???] ' s face ; then it went deathly white . before
he could conceal it [???] they saw through the mask the anguish of a mind in
doubt [???] loathing to stay and dreading to leave its [???] . for a second he
[???] [???] and no one breathed . then he spoke [???] and his voice was shrill and
cold . pride and hate were conquering him .
' will i come down ? ' he mocked . ' does an unarmed man come down to
speak
with robbers out of doors ? i can hear you w ell enough here . i am no fool [???]
and i do not trust you [???] [???] . they do not stand openly on my stairs [???] but
i know where the wild wood - demons are lurking [???] at your command . '
' the treacherous are ever [???] [???] ' answered [???] wearily . ' but
you need not fear for your skin . i do not wish to kill you [???] or hurt you [???] as
you would know [???] if you really understood me . and i have the power to protect
you . i am giving you a last chance . you can leave orthanc [???] free - - if you
choose . '
' that sounds well [???] ' sneered [???] . ' very much in the manner of
[???] the grey : so [???] [???] and so very kind . i do not doubt that
you would find orthanc commodious [???] and my departure convenient . but
why
should i wish to leave ? and what do you mean by ' free ' ? there are
conditions [???] i presume ? '
' reasons for leaving you can see from your windows . ' answered [???] .
' others will occur to your thought . your servants are destroyed and
scattered ; your neighbours you have made your enemies ; and you have cheated
your new master . or tried to do so . when his eye turns hither [???] it will be
the red eye of wrath . but when i say ' free ' [???] i mean ' free ' : free from bond [???]
of chain or command : to go where you will [???] even [???] even to [???] [???] [???] [???] if
you desire . but you will first [???] to me the key of orthanc [???] and your
staff . they shall be pledges of your conduct [???] to be returned later [???] if you

merit them . '
[???] ' s face grew livid [???] twisted with rage [???] and a red light was
kindled in his eyes . he laughed wildly . ' later ! ' he cried [???] and his voice
rose to a scream . ' later ! yes [???] when you also have the keys of barad - dyr
itself [???] i suppose ; and the crowns of seven kings . and the rods of the five
[???] [???] and have purchased yourself a pair of boots many sizes larger than
those that you wear now . a modest plan . hardly one in which my help is
needed ! i have other things to do . do not be a fool . if you wish to treat
with me [???] while you have a chance [???] go away [???] and come back when you are
sober !
and leave behind these cut - throats and small rag - tag that dangle at your
tail ! good day ! ' he turned and left the [???] .
' come back [???] [???] ! ' said [???] in a commanding voice . to the
amazement of the others [???] [???] turned again . and as if dragged against his
will [???] he came slowly back to the iron rail [???] leaning on it [???] breathing hard .
his face was lined and [???] . his hand clutched his heavy black staff
like a claw .
' i did not give you leave to go [???] ' said [???] sternly . ' i have not
finished . you have become a fool [???] [???] [???] and yet pitiable . you might still
have turned away from folly and evil [???] and have been of service . but you
choose to stay and gnaw the ends of your old plots . stay then ! but i warn
you . you will not easily come out again . not unless the dark hands of the
east stretch out to take you . [???] ! ' he cried [???] and his voice grew in
power and authority . ' behold [???] i am not [???] the grey [???] whom you betrayed .
i am [???] the white [???] who has returned from death . you have no colour
now [???]
and i cast you from the order and from the council . '
he raised his hand [???] and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice . ' [???] [???]
your staff is broken . ' there was a crack [???] and the staff split asunder in
[???] ' s hand [???] and the head of it fell down at [???] ' s feet . ' go ! ' said
[???] . with a cry [???] fell back and [???] away . at that moment a
heavy shining thing came hurtling down from above . it glanced off the iron
rail [???] even as [???] left it [???] and passing close to [???] ' s head [???] it smote
the stair on which he stood . the rail rang and snapped . the stair cracked
and [???] in glittering sparks . but the ball was [???] : it rolled on
down the steps [???] a globe of crystal [???] dark [???] but glowing with a heart of fire .
as it bounded away towards a pool [???] ran after it and picked it up .

' the murderous rogue ! ' cried jomer . but [???] was [???] . no [???] that
was not thrown b [???] [???] he said ; nor even at his bidding [???] i think . it came
from a window far above . a parting shot from master [???] [???] i fancy [???]
but
ill aimed . '
' the aim was poor [???] maybe [???] because he could not make up his mind which
he hated more [???] you or [???] [???] ' said [???] .
' that may be so [???] ' said [???] . ' small comfort will those two have in
their companionship : they will gnaw one another with words . but the
punishment is just . if [???] ever comes out of orthanc alive [???] it will
be more than he deserves .
' here [???] my lad [???] i ' ll take that ! i did not ask you to handle it [???] ' he
cried [???] turning sharply and seeing [???] coming up the steps [???] slowly [???] as if
he were bearing a great weight . he went down to meet him and hastily took
the dark globe from the hobbit [???] wrapping it in the folds of his cloak . ' i
will take care of this [???] ' he said . ' it is not a thing [???] i guess [???] that [???]
would have chosen to cast away . '
' but he may have other things to cast [???] ' said [???] . ' if that is the end
of the debate [???] let us go out of stone ' s throw [???] at least ! '
' it is the end [???] ' said [???] . ' let us go . '
they turned their backs on the doors of orthanc [???] and went down . the
riders hailed the king with joy [???] and saluted [???] . the spell of [???]
was broken : they had seen him come at call [???] and [???] away [???] dismissed .
' well [???] that is done [???] ' said [???] . ' now i must find [???] and tell
him how things have gone . '
' he will have guessed [???] surely ? ' said merry . ' were they likely to end
any other way ? '
' not likely [???] ' answered [???] [???] ' though they came to the balance of a
hair . but i had reasons for trying ; some merciful and some less so . first
[???] was shown that the power of his voice was waning . he cannot be
both
tyrant and counsellor . when the plot is ripe it remains no longer secret .
yet he fell into the trap [???] and tried to deal with his [???] piece - meal [???]
while others listened . then i gave him a last choice and a fair one : to
renounce both [???] and his private [???] [???] and make amends by helping
us
in our need . he knows our need [???] none better . great service he could have

rendered . but he has chosen to withhold it [???] and keep the power of orthanc .
he will not serve [???] only command . he lives now in terror of the shadow of
[???] [???] and yet he still dreams of riding the storm . unhappy fool ! he will
be devoured [???] if the power of the east stretches out its arms to [???] . we
cannot destroy orthanc from without [???] but [???] - - who knows what he can
do ? '
' and what if [???] does not conquer ? what will you do to him ? ' asked
[???] .
' i ? nothing ! ' said [???] . ' i will do nothing to him . i do not wish
for mastery . what w ill become of him ? i cannot say . i grieve that so much
that was good now festers in the tower . still for us things have not gone
badly . strange are the turns of fortune ! often does hatred hurt itself ! i
guess that [???] even if we had entered in [???] we could have found few treasures in
orthanc more precious than the thing which [???] threw down at us . '
a shrill shriek ; suddenly cut off [???] came from an open window high above .
' it seems that [???] thinks so too [???] ' said [???] . ' let us leave
them ! '
they returned now to the ruins of the gate . hardly had they passed out
under the arch [???] when [???] from among the shadows of the piled stones where they
had stood [???] [???] and a dozen other ents came striding up . [???] [???] [???]
and legolas gazed at them in wonder .
' here are three of my companions [???] [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' i have
spoken of them [???] but you have not yet seen them . ' he named them one by one .
the old ent looked at them long and searchingly [???] and spoke to them in
turn . last he turned to legolas . ' so you have come all the way from
[???] [???] my good elf ? a very great forest it used to be ! '
' and still is [???] ' said legolas . ' but not so great that we who dwell there
ever tire of seeing new trees . i should dearly love to journey in fangorn ' s
wood . i scarcely passed beyond the eaves of it [???] and i did not wish to turn
back . '
[???] ' s eyes gleamed with pleasure . ' i hope you may have your wish [???]
ere the hills be much older [???] ' he said .
' i will come [???] if i have the fortune [???] ' said legolas . ' i have made a
bargain with my friend that [???] if all goes well [???] we will visit fangorn
together - - by your leave . '
' any elf that comes with you will be welcome [???] ' said [???] .
' the friend i speak of is not an elf [???] ' said legolas ; ' i mean [???] [???]

[???] ' s son here . ' [???] bowed low [???] and the axe slipped from his belt and
[???] on the ground .
' hoom [???] hm ! ah now [???] ' said [???] [???] looking dark - eyed at him . ' a dwarf
and an axe - bearer ! hoom ! i have good will to elves ; but you ask much . this
is a strange friendship ! ' ' strange it may seem [???] ' said legolas ; ' but while
[???] lives i shall not come to fangorn alone . his axe is not for trees [???] but
for orc - necks [???] o fangorn [???] master of fangorn ' s wood . forty - two he hewed in
the battle . '
' hoo ! come now ! ' said [???] . ' that is a better story ! well [???] well [???]
things will go as they will ; and there is no need to hurry to meet them . but
now we must part for a while . day is drawing to an end [???] yet [???] says you
must go ere nightfall [???] and the lord of the mark is eager for his own house . '
' yes [???] we must go [???] and go now [???] ' said [???] . ' i fear that i must take
your [???] from you . but you will manage well enough without them . '
' maybe i shall [???] ' said [???] . ' but i shall miss them . we have become
friends in so short a while that i think i must be getting hasty - - growing
backwards towards youth [???] perhaps . but there [???] they are the first new thing
under sun or moon that i have seen for many a long [???] long day . i shall not
forget them . i have put their names into the long list . ents will remember
it .
ents the earthborn [???] old as mountains [???]
the wide - walkers [???] water drinking ;
and hungry as hunters [???] the hobbit children [???]
the laughing - folk [???] the little people [???]
they shall remain friends as long as leaves are renewed . fare you well !
but if you hear news up in your pleasant land [???] in the shire [???] send me word !
you know what i mean : word or sight of the [???] . come yourselves if
you
can ! '
' we will ! ' said merry and [???] together [???] and they turned away
hastily . [???] looked at them [???] and was silent for a while [???] shaking his
head thoughtfully . then he turned to [???] .
' so [???] would not leave ? ' he said . ' i did not think he would . his
heart is as rotten as a black huorn ' s . still [???] if i were overcome and all my
trees destroyed [???] i would not come while i had one dark hole left to hide
in . '
' no [???] ' said [???] . ' but you have not plotted to cover all the world

with your trees and choke all other living things . but there it is [???] [???]
remains to nurse his hatred and weave again such webs as he can . he has the
key of orthanc . but he must not be allowed to escape . '
' indeed no ! ents will see to that [???] ' said [???] . ' [???] shall not
set foot beyond the rock [???] without my leave . ents will watch over him . '
' good ! ' said [???] . ' that is what i hoped . now i can go and turn to
other matters with one care the less . but you must be wary . the waters have
gone down . it will not be enough to put [???] round the tower [???] i fear . i
do not doubt that there were deep ways delved under orthanc [???] and that
[???] hopes to go and come [???] [???] before long . if you will undertake
the labour [???] i beg you to pour in the waters again ; and do so [???] until [???]
remains a standing pool [???] or you discover the outlets . when all the
underground places are drowned [???] and the outlets blocked [???] then [???] must
stay upstairs and look out of the windows . '
' leave it to the ents ! ' said [???] . ' we shall search the valley
from head to foot and peer under every [???] . trees are coming back to live
here [???] old trees [???] wild trees . the [???] we will call it . not a [???]
will go her e [???] but i shall know of it . leave it to ents ! until seven times
the years in which he tormented us have passed [???] we shall not tire of
watching him . '




chapter 11 . the [???]



the sun was sinking behind the long western arm of the mounta ins when
[???] and his companions [???] and the king with his riders [???] set out again from
[???] . [???] took merry behind him [???] and [???] took [???] . two of
the
king ' s men went on ahead [???] riding swiftly [???] and passed soon out of sight down
into the valley . the others followed at an easy pace .
ents in a solemn row stood like statues at the gate [???] with their long
arms [???] [???] but they made no sound . merry and [???] looked back [???] when
they had passed some way down the winding road . sunlight was still shining
in the sky [???] but long shadows reached over [???] : grey ruins falling into
darkness . [???] stood alone there now [???] like the distant stump of an old
tree : the [???] thought of their first meeting [???] upon the sunny ledge far
away on the borders of fangorn .
they came to the pillar of the white hand . the pillar was still
standing [???] but the graven hand had been thrown down and broken into small
pieces . right in the middle of the road the long forefinger lay [???] white in
the [???] [???] its red nail darkening to black .
' the ents pay attention to every detail ! ' said [???] .
they rode on [???] and evening deepened in the valley .
' are we riding far tonight [???] [???] ? ' asked merry after a while . ' i
don ' t know how you feel with small rag - tag dangling behind you ; but the
rag - tag is tired and will be glad to stop dangling and lie down . '
' so you heard that ? ' said [???] . ' don ' t let it rankle ! be thankful no
longer words were aimed at you . he had his eyes on you . if it is any comfort
to your pride [???] i should say that [???] at the moment [???] you and [???] are more in
his thoughts than all the rest of us . who you are ; how you came there [???] and
why ; what you know ; whether you were captured [???] and if so [???] how you escaped
when all the [???] perished - - it is with those little [???] that the great
mind [???] f [???] is troubled . a sneer from him [???] [???] [???] is a compliment [???] if
you feel honoured by his concern . '
' thank you ! ' said merry . ' but it is a greater honour to dangle at your
tail [???] [???] . for one thing [???] in that position one has a chance of putting a

question a second time . are we riding far tonight ? '
[???] laughed . ' a most [???] hobbit ! all [???] should have a
hobbit or two in their care - - to teach them the meaning of the word [???] and to
correct them . i beg your pardon . but i have given thought even to these
simple matters . we will ride for a few hours [???] gently [???] until we come to the
end of the valley . tomorrow we must ride faster .
' when we came [???] we meant to go straight from [???] back to the king ' s
house at [???] over the plains [???] a ride of some days . but we have taken
thought and changed the plan . messengers have gone ahead to helm ' s deep [???] to
warn them that the king is returning tomorrow . he will ride from there with
many men to [???] by paths among the hills . from now on no more than
two
or three together are to go openly over the land [???] by day or night [???] when it
can be avoided . '
' nothing or a double helping is your way ! ' said merry . ' i am afraid i
was not looking beyond tonight ' s bed . where and what are helm ' s deep and all
the rest of it ? i don ' t know anything about this country . '
' then you ' d best learn something [???] if you wish to understand what is
happening . but not just now [???] and not from me : i have too many pressing
things to think about . '
' all right [???] i ' ll tackle strider by the camp - fire : he ' s less testy . but
why all this secrecy ? i thought we ' d won the battle ! '
yes [???] we have won [???] but only the first victor and that in itself
increases our danger . there was some link between [???] and [???] [???]
which
i have not yet fathomed . how they exchanged news i am not sure ; but they did
so . the eye of barad - dyr will be looking impatiently towards the [???] ' s
vale [???] i think ; and towards [???] . the less it sees the better . '
the road passed slowly [???] winding down the valley . now further [???] and now
nearer isen flowed in its stony bed . night came down from the mountains . all
the mists were gone . a chill wind blew . the moon [???] now waxing round [???] filled
the eastern sky with a pale cold sheen . the shoulders of the mountain to
their right [???] down to bare hills . the wide plains opened grey before
them .
at last they halted . then they turned aside [???] leaving the highway and
taking to the sweet upland turf again . going westward a mile or so they came
to a dale . it opened southward [???] leaning back into the slope of round dol

baran [???] the last hill of the northern ranges [???] [???] [???] crowned with
heather . the sides of the glen were [???] with last year ' s [???] [???] among
which the tight - curled [???] of spring were just thrusting through the
sweet - scented earth . [???] grew thick upon the low banks [???] and under
them they made their camp [???] two hours or so before the middle of the night .
they lit a fire in a hollow [???] down among the roots of a spreading [???] [???]
tall as a tree [???] [???] with age ; but hale in every limb . buds were swelling
at each twig ' s tip .
guards were set [???] two at a watch . the rest [???] after they had supped [???]
wrapped themselves in a cloak and blanket and slept . the [???] lay in a
corner by themselves upon a pile of old [???] . merry was sleepy [???] but
[???] now seemed curiously restless . the [???] cracked and rustled [???] as he
twisted and turned .
' what ' s the matter ? ' asked merry . ' are you lying on an ant - hill ? '
' no [???] ' said [???] [???] ' but i ' m not comfortable . i wonder how long it is
since i slept in a bed ? '
merry yawned . ' work it out on your fingers ! ' he said . ' but you must
know how long it is since we left [???] . '
' oh [???] that ! ' said [???] . ' i mean a real bed in a bedroom . '
' well [???] [???] then [???] ' said merry . ' but i could sleep anywhere
tonight . '
' you had the luck [???] merry [???] ' said [???] softly [???] after a long pause . ' you
were riding with [???] . '
' well [???] what of it ? '
' did you get any news [???] any information out of him ? '
' yes [???] a good deal . more than usual . but you heard it all or most of it :
you were close by [???] and we were talking no secrets . but you can go with him
tomorrow [???] if you think you can get more out of him - and if he ' ll have you . '
' can i ? good ! but he ' s close [???] isn ' t he ? not changed at all . '
' oh yes [???] he is ! ' said merry [???] waking up a little [???] and beginning to
wonder what was bothering his companion . ' he has grown [???] or something . he
can
be both kinder and more alarming [???] merrier and more solemn than before [???] i
think . he has changed ; but we have not had a chance to see how much [???] yet .
but th ink of the last part of that business with [???] ! remember [???]
was once [???] ' s superior : head of the council [???] whatever that may be

exactly . he was [???] the white . [???] is the white now . [???]
came
when he was told [???] and his rod was taken ; and then he was just told to go [???]
and he went ! '
' well [???] if [???] has changed at all [???] then he ' s closer than ever that ' s
all [???] ' [???] argued . ' that - glass ball [???] now . he seemed mighty pleased with
it . he knows or guesses something about i t . but does he tell us what ? no [???]
not a word . yet i picked it up [???] and i saved it from rolling into a pool .
here [???] i ' ll take that [???] my lad - - that ' s all . i wonder what it is ? it felt so
very heavy . ' [???] ' s voice fell very low as if he was talking to h imself .
' hullo ! ' said merry . ' so that ' s what is bothering you ? now [???] [???] my
lad [???] don ' t forget gildor ' s saying - - the one sam used to quote : do not
meddle in the at fairs of [???] [???] for they are subtle and quick to anger . '
' but our whole life for months has been one long meddling in the
affairs of [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' i should like a bit of information as
well as danger . i should like a look at that ball . '
' go to sleep ! ' said merry . ' you ' ll get information enough [???] sooner or
later . my dear [???] [???] no took ever beat a [???] for [???] ;
but is this the time [???] i ask you ? '
' all right ! what ' s the harm in my telling you what i should like : a
look at that stone ? i know i can ' t have it [???] with old ganda lf sitting on it [???]
like a hen on an egg . but it doesn ' t help much to get no more from you than
a you - can ' t - have - it so - go - to - sleep ! '
' well [???] what else could i say ? ' said merry . ' i ' m sorry [???] [???] [???] but you
really must wait till the morning . i ' ll be as curious as you like after
breakfast [???] and i ' ll help in any way i can at [???] - [???] . but i can ' t
keep awake any longer . if i yawn any more [???] i shall split at the ears . good
night ! '
[???] said no more . he lay still now [???] but sleep remained far away ; and
it was not encouraged by the sound of merry breathing softly [???] asleep in a
few minutes after saying good night . ' the thought of the dark globe seemed
to grow stronger as all grew quiet . [???] felt again its weight in his
hands [???] and saw again the mysterious red depths into which he had looked for
a moment . he tossed and turned and tried to think of something else .
at last he could stand it no longer . he got up and looked round . it was
chilly [???] and he wrapped his cloak about him . the moon was shining cold and
white [???] down into the dell [???] and the shadows of the bushes were black . all

about lay sleeping shapes . the two guards were not in view : they were up on
the hill [???] perhaps [???] or hidden in the [???] . driven by some impulse that he
did not understand [???] [???] walked softly to where [???] lay . he looked
down at him . the [???] seemed asleep [???] but with lids not fully closed : there
was a glitter of eyes under his long [???] . [???] stepped back hastily .
but [???] made no sign ; and drawn forward once more [???] half against his
will [???] the hobbit crept up again from behind the [???] ' s head . he was rolled
in a blanket [???] with his cloak spread over the top ; and close beside him [???]
between his right side and his bent arm [???] there was a [???] [???] something
round wrapped in a dark cloth ; his hand seemed only just to have slipped off
it to the ground .
hardly breathing [???] [???] crept nearer [???] foot by foot . at last he knelt
down . then he put his hands out [???] [???] and slowly lifted the lump up :
it did not seem quite so heavy as he had expected . ' only some bundle of
oddments [???] perhaps [???] after all [???] ' he thought with a strange sense of relief ;
but he did not put the bundle down again . he stood for a moment clasping it .
then an idea came into his mind . he [???] away [???] found a large stone [???] and
came back .
quickly now he drew off the cloth [???] wrapped the stone in it and kneeling
down [???] laid it back by the [???] ' s hand . then at last he looked at the thing
that he had uncovered . there it was : a smooth globe of crystal [???] now dark and
dead [???] lying bare before his knees . [???] lifted it [???] covered it hurriedly in
his own cloak [???] and half turned to go back to his bed . at that moment [???]
moved in his sleep [???] and muttered some words : they seemed to be in a strange
tongue ; his hand groped out and clasped the wrapped stone [???] then he sighed
and did not move again .
' you [???] fool ! ' [???] muttered to himself . ' you ' re going to get
yourself into frightful trouble . put it back quick ! ' but he found now that
his knees quaked [???] and he did not dare to go near enough to the [???] to
reach the bundle . ' i ' ll never get it back now without waking him [???] ' he
thought [???] ' not till i ' m a bit calmer . s [???] i may as well have a look first . not
just here though ! ' he stole away [???] and sat down on a green hillock not far
from his bed . the moon looked in over the edge of the dell .
[???] sat with his knees drawn up and the ball between them . he bent
low over it [???] looking like a greedy child stooping over a bowl of food [???] in a
corner away from others . he drew his cloak aside and gazed at it . the air
seemed still and tense about him . at first the globe was dark [???] black as jet [???]

with the moonlight gleaming on its surface . then ther e came a faint glow and
stir in the heart of it [???] and it held his eyes [???] so that now he could not look
away . soon all the inside seemed on fire ; the ball was spinning [???] or the
lights within were revolving . suddenly the lights went out . he gave a gasp
and struggled ; but he remained bent [???] clasping the ball with both hands .
closer and closer he bent [???] and then became rigid ; his lips moved [???]
for a while . then with a strangled cry he fell back and lay still .
the cry was piercing . the guards leapt down from the banks . all the
camp was soon [???] .
' so this is the thief ! ' said [???] . hastily he cast his cloak over
the globe where it lay . ' but you [???] [???] ! this is a grievous turn to
things ! ' he knelt by [???] ' s body : the hobbit was lying on his back rigid [???]
with [???] eyes staring up at the sky . ' the devilry ! what mischief has he
done - to himself [???] and to all of us ? ' the [???] ' s face was drawn and [???] .
he took [???] ' s hand and bent over his face [???] listening for his breath ;
then he laid his hands on his brow . the hobbit [???] . his eyes closed .
he cried out ; and sat up . staring in [???] at all the faces round
him [???] pale in the moonlight .
' it is not for you [???] [???] ! ' he cried in a shrill and toneless voice
shrinking away from [???] . ' i will send for it at once . do you understand ?
say just that ! ' then he struggled to get up and escape but [???] held him
gently and firmly .
' [???] took ! ' he said . ' come back ! '
the hobbit [???] and fell back [???] [???] to the [???] ' s hand .
' [???] ! ' he cried . ' [???] ! forgive me ! '
' forgive you ? ' said the [???] . ' tell me first what you have done ! '
' i [???] i took the ball and looked at it [???] ' [???] [???] ; ' and i saw
things that frightened me . and i wanted to go away [???] but i couldn ' t . and then
he came and questioned me ; and he looked at me [???] and [???] and that is all i
remember . '
' that won ' t do [???] ' said [???] sternly . ' what did you see [???] and what did
you say ? '
[???] shut his eyes and shivered [???] but said nothing . they all stared at
him in silence [???] except merry who turned away . but [???] ' s face was still
hard . ' speak ! ' he said .
in a low [???] voice [???] began again [???] and slowly his words grew
clearer and stronger . ' i saw a dark sky [???] and tall battlements [???] ' he said .

' and tiny stars . it seemed very far away and long ago [???] yet hard and clear .
then the stars went in and out - they were cut off by things with wings . very
big [???] i think [???] really ; but in the glass they looked like bats wheeling round
the tower . i thought there were nine of them . one began to fly straight
towards me [???] getting bigger and bigger . it had a horrible - - no [???] no ! i can ' t
say .
' i tried to get away [???] because i thought it would fly out ; but when it
had covered all the globe [???] it disappeared . then he came . he did not speak so
that i could hear words . he just looked [???] and i understood .
' [???] so you have come back ? why have you neglected to report for so long ? [???]
' i did not answer . he said : [???] who are you ? [???] i still did not answer [???] but
it hurt me horribly ; and he pressed me [???] so i said : [???] a hobbit . [???]
' then suddenly he seemed to see me [???] and he laughed at me . it was cruel .
it was like being stabbed with knives . i struggled . but he sa id : [???] wait a
moment ! we shall meet again soon . tell [???] that this dainty is not for
him . i will send for it at once . do you understand ? say just that ! [???]
' then he gloated over me . i felt i was falling to pieces . no [???] no ! i
can ' t say any more . i don ' t remember anything else . '
' look at me ! ' said [???] .
[???] looked up straight into his eyes . the [???] held his gaze for a
moment in silence . then his face grew gentler [???] and the shadow of a smile
appeared . he laid his hand softly on [???] ' s head .
' all right ! ' he said . ' say no more ! you have taken no harm . there is no
lie in your eyes [???] as i feared . but he did not speak long with you . a fool [???]
but an honest fool [???] you remain [???] [???] took . wiser ones might have done
worse in such a pass . but mark this ! you have been saved [???] and all your
friends too [???] mainly by good fortune [???] as it is called . you cannot count on it
a second time . if he had questioned you [???] then and there [???] almost certainly
you would have told all that you know [???] to the ruin of us all . but he was too
eager . he did not want information only : he wanted you [???] quickly [???] so that he
could deal with you in the dark tower [???] slowly . don ' t shudder ! if you will
meddle in the affairs of [???] [???] you must be prepared to think of such
things . but come ! i forgive you . be comforted ! things have not turned out as
evilly as they might . '
he lifted [???] gently and carried him back to his bed . merry
followed [???] and sat down beside him . lie there and rest [???] if you can [???] [???] ! '
said [???] . ' trust me . if you feel an itch in your palms again [???] tell me of

it ! such things can be cured . but anyway [???] my dear hobbit [???] don ' t put a lump
of rock under my elbow again ! now [???] i will leave you two together for a
while . '
with that [???] returned to the others [???] who were still standing by
the orthanc - stone in troubled thought . ' peril comes in the night when least
expected [???] ' he said . ' we have had a narrow escape ! '
' how is the hobbit [???] [???] ? ' asked [???] .
' i think all will be well now [???] ' answered [???] . ' he was not held
long [???] and [???] have an amazing power of recovery . the memory [???] or the
horror of it [???] will probably fade quickly . too quickly [???] perhaps . will you [???]
[???] [???] take the orthanc - stone and guard it ? it is a dangerous charge . '
' dangerous indeed [???] but not to all [???] ' said [???] . ' there is one who may
claim it by right . for this assuredly is the [???] of orthanc from the
treasury of [???] [???] set here by the kings of [???] . now my hour draws
near . i will take it . '
[???] looked at [???] [???] and then [???] to the surprise of the others [???] he
lifted the covered stone [???] and bowed as he presented it .
' receive it [???] lord ! ' he said : ' in earnest of other things that shall be
given back . but if i may counsel you in the use of your own [???] do not use it
- - yet ! be wary ! '
' when have i been hasty or unwary [???] who have waited and prepared for so
many long years ? ' said [???] .
' never yet . do not then stumble at the end of the road [???] ' answered
[???] . ' but at the least keep this thing secret . you [???] and all others that
stand here ! the hobbit [???] [???] [???] above all should not know where it is
bestowed . the evil fit may come on him again . for alas ! he has handled it
and looked in it [???] as should never have happened . he ought never to have
touched it in [???] [???] and there i should have been quicker . but my mind
was bent on [???] [???] and i did not at once guess the nature of the stone .
then i was weary [???] and as i lay pondering it [???] sleep overcame me . now i know ! '
' yes [???] there can be no doubt [???] ' said [???] . ' at last we know the link '
between [???] and [???] [???] and how it worked . much is explained . ' ' strange
powers have our enemies [???] and strange weaknesses ! ' said [???] . ' but it has
long been said : oft evil will shall evil mar . '
' that many times is seen [???] ' said [???] . ' but at this time we have been
strangely fortunate . maybe [???] i have been saved by this hobbit from a grave
blunder . i had considered whether or not to probe this stone myself to find

its uses . had i done so [???] i should have been revealed to him myself . i am not
ready for such a trial [???] if indeed i shall ever be so : but even if i found
the power to withdraw myself [???] it would be [???] for him to see me [???] yet
- - until the hour comes when secrecy will avail no longer . '
' that hour is now come [???] i think [???] ' said [???] .
' not yet [???] ' said [???] . ' there remains a short while of doubt which we
must use . the enemy [???] it is clear [???] thought that the stone was in orthanc - -
why should he not ? and that therefore the hobbit was captive there [???] driven
to look in the glass for his torment by [???] . that dark mind will be
filled now with the voice and face of the hobbit and with expectation : it
may take some time before he learns his error . we must snatch that time . we
have been too leisurely . we must move . the neighbourhood of [???] is no
place now to linger in . i will ride ahead at once with [???] took . it
will be better for him than lying in the dark while others sleep . '
' i will keep jomer and ten riders [???] ' said the king . ' they shall ride
with me at early day . the rest may go with [???] and ride as soon as they
have a mind . '
' as you will [???] ' said [???] . ' but make all the speed you may to the
cover of the hills [???] to helm ' s deep ! '
at that moment a shadow fell over them . the bright moonlight seemed to
be suddenly cut off . several of the riders cried out [???] and [???] [???] holding
their arms above their hea ds [???] as if to ward off a blow from above : a blind
fear and a deadly cold fell on them . cowering they looked up . a vast winged
shape passed over the moon like a black cloud . it wheeled and went north [???]
flying at a speed greater than any wind of middle - earth . the stars fainted
before it . it was gone .
they stood up [???] rigid as stones . [???] was gazing up [???] his arms out and
downwards [???] stiff [???] his hands [???] .
' [???] ! ' he cried . ' the messenger of [???] . the storm is coming . the
[???] have crossed the river ! ride [???] ride ! wait not for the dawn ! let not
the swift wait for the slow ! ride ! '
he sprang away [???] calling [???] as he ran . [???] followed him .
going to [???] [???] [???] picked him up in his arms . ' you shall come with me
this time [???] ' he said . ' [???] shall show you his paces . ' then he ran to
the place where he had slept . [???] stood there already . [???] the
small bag which was all his [???] across his shoulders [???] the [???] leapt
upon the horse ' s back . [???] n lifted [???] and set him in [???] ' s arms [???]

[???] wrapped in cloak and blanket .
' farewell ! follow fast ! ' cried [???] . ' away [???] [???] ! '
the great horse tossed his head . his flowing tail [???] in the
moonlight . then he leapt forward [???] spurning the earth [???] and was gone like the
north wind from the mountains .
' a beautiful [???] restful night ! ' said merry to [???] . ' some folk have
wonderful luck . he did not want to sleep [???] and he wanted to ride with [???]
- - and there he goes ! instead of being turned into a stone himself to stand
here for ever as a warning . '
' if you had been the first to lift the orthanc - stone [???] and not he [???] how
would it be now ? ' said [???] . ' you might have done worse . who can say ?
but
now it is your luck to come with me [???] i fear . at once . go and get ready [???] and
bring anything that [???] left behind . make haste ! '
over the plains [???] was flying [???] needing no urging and no
[???] . less than an hour had passed [???] and they had reached the fords of
isen and crossed them . the mound of the riders and its cold spears lay grey
behind them .
[???] was recovering . he was warm [???] but the wind in his face was keen
and refreshing . he was with [???] . the horror of the stone and of the
hideous shadow over the moon was fading [???] things left behind in the mists of
the mountains or in a passing dream . he drew a deep breath .
' i did not know you rode bare - back [???] [???] [???] ' he said . ' you haven ' t a
saddle or a bridle ! '
' i do not ride elf - fashion [???] except on [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' but
[???] will have no harness . you do not ride [???] : he is willing to
carry you - or not . if he is willing [???] that is enough . it is then his business
to see that you remain on his back [???] unless you jump off into the air . '
' how fast is he going ? ' asked [???] . ' fast by the wind [???] but very
smooth . and how light his [???] are ! '
' he is running now as fast as the swiftest horse could gallop [???] '
answered [???] ; ' but that is not fast for him . the land is rising a little
here [???] and is more broken than it was beyond the river . but see how the white
mountains are drawing near under the stars ! yonder are the [???] peaks
like black spears . it will not be long before we reach the branching roads
and come to the deeping - coomb [???] where the battle was fought two nights ago . '
[???] was silent again for a while . he heard [???] singing softly to

himself [???] murmuring brief snatches of rhyme in many tongues [???] as the miles ran
under them . at last the [???] passed into a song of which the hobbit caught
the words : a few lines came clear to his ears through the rushing of the
wind :
tall ships and tall kings
three times three [???]
what brought they from the foundered land
over the flowing sea ?
seven stars and seven stones
and one white tree .
' what are you saying [???] [???] ? ' asked [???] .
' i was just running over some of the rhymes of lore in my mind '
answered the [???] . ' [???] [???] i suppose [???] have forgotten them [???] even those
that they ever knew . '
' no [???] not all [???] ' said [???] . ' and we have many of our own [???] which
wouldn ' t interest you [???] perhaps . but i have never heard this one . what is it
about - - the seven stars and seven stones ? '
' about the [???] of the kings of old [???] ' said [???] .
' and what are they ? '
' the name meant that which looks far away . the orthanc - stone was one . '
' then it was not made [???] not made ' - - [???] [???] - - ' by the enemy ? '
' no [???] ' said [???] . ' nor by [???] . it is beyond his art [???] and beyond
[???] ' s too . the [???] came from beyond westernesse from [???] .
the
[???] made them . flanor himself [???] maybe [???] wrought them [???] in days so long ago
that the time cannot be measured in years . but there is nothing that [???]
cannot turn to evil uses . alas for [???] ! it was his downfall [???] as i now
perceive . perilous to us all are the devices of an art deeper than we
possess ourselves . yet he must bear the blame . fool ! to keep it secret [???] for
his own profit . no word did he ever speak of it to any of the council . we
had not yet given thought to the fate of the [???] of [???] in its
ruinous wars . by men they were almost forgotten . even in [???] they were a
secret known only to a few ; in [???] they were remembered only in a rhyme of
lore among the d [???] nedain . '
' what did the men of old use them for ? ' asked [???] [???] delighted and
astonished at getting answers to so many questions [???] and wondering how long
it would last .

' to see far off [???] and to converse in thought with one another [???] ' said
[???] . ' in that way they long guarded and united the realm of [???] . they
set up stones at minas anor [???] and at minas [???] [???] and at orthanc in the ring
of [???] . the chief and master of these was under the dome of stars at
[???] before its ruin . the three others were far away in the north . in
the house of [???] it is told that they were at ann [???] minas [???] and amon syl [???]
and [???] ' s stone was on the tower hills that look towards m [???] in the
gulf of lune where the grey ships lie .
' each [???] replied to each [???] but all those in [???] were ever open
to the view of [???] . now it appears that [???] as the rock of orthanc has
[???] the storms of time [???] so there the [???] of that tower has
remained . but alone it could do nothing but see small images of things far
off and days remote . very useful [???] no doubt [???] that was to [???] ; yet it
seems that he was not content . further and further abroad he gazed [???] until he
cast his gaze upon barad - dyr . then he was caught !
' who knows where the lost stones of [???] and [???] now lie buried [???] or
drowned deep ? but one . at least [???] must have obtained and mastered to
his purposes . i guess that it was the [???] - stone [???] for he took minas [???]
long ago and turned it into an evil place : minas [???] [???] it has become .
' easy it is now to guess how quickly the roving eye of [???] was
trapped and held ; and how ever since he has been persuaded from afar [???] and
[???] when persuasion would not serve . the biter bit [???] the hawk under the
eagle ' s foot [???] the spider in a steel web ! how long [???] i wonder [???] has he been
constrained to come often to his glass for [???] and instruction [???] and
the orthanc - stone so bent towards barad - dyr that [???] if any save a will of
adamant now looks into it [???] it will bear his mind and sight swiftly thither ?
and how it draws one to itself ! have i not felt it ? even now my heart
desires to test my will upon it [???] to see if i could not wrench it from him
and turn it where i would - to look across the wide seas of water and of time
to tirion the fair [???] and perceive the [???] hand and mind of flanor at
their work [???] while both the white tree and the golden were in flower ! ' he
sighed and fell silent .
' i wish i had known all this before [???] ' said [???] . ' i had no notion of
what i was doing . '
' oh yes [???] you had [???] ' said [???] . ' you knew you were behaving wrongly
and foolishly ; and you told yourself so [???] though you did not listen . i did
not tell you all this before [???] because it is only by musing on all that has

happened that i have at last understood [???] even as we ride together . but if i
had spoken sooner [???] it would not have lessened your desire [???] or made it easier
to resist . on the contrary ! no [???] the burned hand teaches best . after that
advice about fire goes to the heart . '
' it does [???] ' said [???] . ' if all the seven stones were laid out before
me now [???] i should shut my eyes and put my hands in my pockets . '
' good ! ' said [???] . ' that is what i hoped . '
' but i should like to know - - ' [???] began .
' mercy ! ' cried [???] . ' if the giving of information is to be the cure
of your [???] [???] i shall spend all the rest of my days in answering
you . what more do you want to know ? '
' the names of all the stars [???] and of all living things [???] and the whole
history of middle - earth and over - heaven and of the sundering seas ' laughed
[???] . ' of course ! what less ? but i am not in a hurry tonight . at the
moment i was just wondering about the black shadow . i heard you shout
[???] messenger of [???] [???] . what was it ? what could it do at [???] ? '
' it was a black rider on wings [???] a [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' it could have
taken you away to the dark tower . '
' but it was not coming for me [???] was it ? ' faltered [???] . ' i mean [???] it
didn ' t know that i had . . . '
' of course not [???] ' said [???] . ' it is two hundred leagues or more in
straight flight from barad - dyr to orthanc [???] and even a [???] would take a
few hours to fly between them . but [???] certainly looked in the stone
since the orc - raid [???] and more of his secret thought [???] i do not doubt [???] has been
read than he intended . a messenger has been sent to find out what he is
doing . and after what has happened tonight another will come [???] i think [???] and
swiftly . so [???] will come to the last pinch of the vice that he has put
his hand in . he has no captive to send . he has no stone to see with [???] and
cannot answer the summons . [???] will only believe that he is withholding
the captive and refusing to use the stone . it will not help [???] to tell
the truth to the messenger . for [???] may be ruined [???] yet he is still safe
in orthanc . so whether he will or no [???] he will appear a rebel . yet he
[???] us [???] so as to avoid that very thing ! what he will do in such a
plight [???] i cannot guess . he has power still [???] i think [???] while in orthanc [???] to
resist the nine riders . he may try to do so . he may try to trap the [???] [???]
or at least to slay the thing on which it now rides the air . in that case
let [???] look to its horses !

' but i cannot tell how it will fall out [???] well or ill for us . it may be
that the counsels of the enemy will be confused [???] or hindered by his wrath
with [???] . it may be that he will learn that i was there and stood upon
the stairs of orthanc - with [???] at my tail . or that an heir of [???]
lives and stood beside me . if [???] was not deceived by the armour of
[???] [???] he would remember [???] and the title that he claimed . that is what
i fear . and so we fly - - not from danger but into greater danger . every
stride of [???] bears you nearer to the land of shadow [???] [???] took . '
[???] made no answer [???] but clutched his cloak [???] as if a sudden chill had
struck him . grey land passed under them .
' see now ! ' said [???] . ' the westfold dales are opening before us .
here we come back to the eastward road . the dark shadow yonder is the
mouth
of the deeping - coomb . that way lies [???] a nd the glittering caves . do
not ask me about them . ask [???] [???] if you meet again [???] and for the first time
you may get an answer longer than you wish . you will not see the caves
yourself [???] not on this journey . soon they will be far behind . '
' i thought you were going to stop at helm ' s deep ! ' said [???] . ' where
are you going then ? '
' to minas [???] [???] before the seas of war surround it . '
' oh ! and how far is that ? '
' leagues upon leagues [???] ' answered [???] . ' thrice as far as the
dwellings of king [???] [???] and they are more than a hundred miles east from
here [???] as the messengers of [???] fly . [???] must run a longer road .
which will prove the swifter ?
' we shall ride now till [???] [???] and that is some hours away . then
even [???] must rest [???] in some hollow of the hills : at [???] [???] i hope .
sleep [???] if you can ! you may see the first glimmer of dawn upon the golden
roof of the house of [???] . and in two days thence you shall see the purple
shadow of mount [???] and the walls of the tower of [???] white in
the morning .
' away now [???] [???] ! run [???] [???] [???] run as you have never run
before ! now we are come to the lands where you were [???] and every stone
you know . run now ! hope is in speed ! '
[???] tossed his head and cried aloud [???] as if a trumpet had summoned
him to battle . then he sprang forward . fire flew from his feet ; night rushed
over him .

as he fell slowly into sleep [???] [???] had a strange feeling : he and
[???] were still as stone [???] seated upon the statue of a running horse [???]
while the world rolled away beneath his feet with a great noise of wind .

chapter 1 . the taming of [???]



' well [???] master [???] we ' re in a fix and no mistake [???] ' sa id sam [???] . he
stood [???] with hunched shoulders beside [???] [???] and peered out with
puckered eyes into the gloom .
it was the third evening since they had fled from the company [???] as far
as they could tell : they had almost lost count of the hours during which
they had climbed and laboured among the barren [???] and stones of the
emyn
muil [???] sometimes [???] their steps because they could find no way
forward [???] sometimes discovering that they had wandered in a circle back to
where they had been hours before . yet on the whole they had worked steadily
eastward [???] keeping as near as they could find a way to the outer edge of this
strange twisted knot of hills . but always they found its outward faces
sheer [???] high and [???] [???] frowning over the plain below ; beyond its
tumbled skirts lay livid festering marshes where nothing moved and not even
a bird was to be seen .
the [???] stood now on the brink of a tall cliff [???] bare and bleak [???] its
feet wrapped in mist ; and behind them rose the broken [???] crowned with
drifting cloud . a chill wind ` blew from the east . night was gathering over
the shapeless lands before them ; the sickly green of them was fading to a
sullen brown . far away to the right the [???] [???] that had gleamed fitfully in
sun - breaks during the day [???] was now hidden in shadow . but their eyes did not
look beyond the river [???] back to [???] [???] to their friends [???] to the lands of
men . south and east they stared to where [???] at the edge of the [???] night [???]
a dark line hung [???] like distant mountains of motionless smoke . every now and
again a tiny red gleam far away [???] upwards on the rim of earth and
sky .
` what a fix ! ' said sam . ` that ' s the one place in all the lands we ' ve
ever heard of that we don ' t want to see any closer ; and that ' s the one place
we ' re trying to get to ! and that ' s just where we can ' t get [???] nohow . we ' ve
come the wrong way altogether [???] seemingly . we can ' t get down ; and if we did

get down [???] we ' d find all that green land a [???] bog [???] i ' ll warrant . phew ! can
you smell it ? ' he [???] at the wind .
' yes [???] i can smell it [???] ' said [???] [???] but he did not move [???] and his eyes
remained fixed [???] staring out towards the dark line and the [???] flame .
` [???] ! ' he muttered under his breath . ' if i must go there i wish i could
come there quickly and make an end ! ' he [???] . the wind was chilly and
yet heavy with an odour of cold decay . ` well [???] ' he said [???] at last withdrawing
his eyes [???] ` we cannot stay here all night [???] fix or no fix . we must find a more
sheltered spot [???] and camp once more ; and perhaps another day will show us a
path . '
' or another and another and another [???] ' muttered sam . ` or maybe no day .
we ' ve come the wrong way . '
' i wonder [???] ' said [???] . ' it ' s my doom [???] i think [???] to go to that shadow
yonder [???] so that a way will be found . but will good or evil show it to me ?
what hope we had was in speed . delay plays into the enemy ' s hands - and here i
am : delayed . is it the will of the dark tower that steers us ? all my choices
have proved ill . i should have left the company long before [???] and come down
from the north [???] east of the river and of the emyn muil [???] and so over the hard
of battle plain to the passes of [???] . but now it isn ' t possible for you
and me alone to find a way back [???] and the [???] are [???] on the east bank .
every day that passes is a precious day lost . i am tired [???] sam . i don ' t know
what is to be done . what food have we got left ? '
' only those [???] what d ' you call ' em [???] [???] [???] mr . [???] . a fair supply . but
they are better than naught [???] by a long bite . i never thought [???] though [???] when i
first set tooth in them [???] that i should ever come to wish for a change . but i
do now : a bit of plain bread [???] and a mug - - aye [???] half a mug - - of beer would
go down proper . i ' ve lugged my cooking - gear all the way from the last camp [???]
and what use has it been ? naught to make a fire with [???] for a start ; and
naught to cook [???] not even grass ! '
they turned away and went down into a stony hollow . the westering sun
was caught into clouds [???] and night came swiftly . they slept as well as they
could for the cold [???] turn and turn about [???] in a nook among great jagged
[???] of weathered rock ; at least they were sheltered from the [???]
wind .
` did you see them again [???] mr . [???] ? ' asked sam [???] as they sat [???] stiff and
chilled [???] [???] [???] of [???] [???] in the cold grey of early morning .
' no [???] ' said [???] . ` i ' ve heard nothing [???] and seen nothing [???] for two nights

now . '
` nor me [???] ' said sam . ` [???] ! those eyes did give me a turn ! but perhaps
we ' ve shaken him off at last [???] the miserable [???] . [???] ! i ' ll give him
[???] in his throat [???] if ever i get my hands on his neck . '
' i hope you ' ll never need to [???] ' said [???] . ` i don ' t know how he
followed us ; but it may be that he ' s lost us again [???] as you say . in this dry
bleak land we can ' t leave many [???] [???] nor much scent [???] even for his
snuffling nose . '
' i hope that ' s the way of it [???] ' said sam . ' i wish we could be rid of him
for good ! '
' so do i [???] ' said [???] ; ' but he ' s not my chief trouble . i wish we could
get away from these hills ! i hate them . i feel all naked on the east side [???]
stuck up here with nothing but the dead flats between me and that shadow
yonder . there ' s an eye in it . come on ! we ' ve got to get down today somehow . '
but that day wore on [???] and when afternoon faded towards evening they
were still [???] along the ridge and had found no way of escape .
sometimes in the silence of that barren country they fancied that they
heard faint sounds behind them [???] a stone falling [???] or the imagined step of
flapping feet on the rock . but if they halted and stood still listening [???]
they heard no more [???] nothing but the wind sighing over the edges of the
stones - - yet even that reminded them of breath softly hissing through sharp
teeth .
all that day the outer ridge of the emyn muil had been bending
gradually northward [???] as they struggled on . along its brink there now
stretched a wide tumbled flat of scored and weathered rock [???] cut every now
and again by trench - like gullies that [???] steeply down to deep notches in
the cliff - face . to find a path in these [???] [???] which were becoming deeper
and more frequent [???] [???] and sam were driven to their left [???] well away from
the edge [???] and they did not notice that for several miles they had been going
slowly but steadily [???] : the cliff - top was sinking towards the level of
the [???] .
at last they were brought to a halt . the ridge took a sharper bend
nor thward and was [???] by a deeper ravine . on the further side it reared
up again [???] many fathoms at a single leap : a great grey cliff loomed before
them [???] cut sheer down as if by a knife stroke . they could go no further
forwards [???] and must turn now either west or east . but west would lead them
only into more labour and delay [???] back towards the heart of the hills ; east

would take them to the outer [???] .
` there ' s nothing for it but to scramble down this gully [???] sam [???] ' said
[???] . ` let ' s see what it leads to ! '
' a [???] drop [???] i ' ll bet [???] ' said sam .
the cleft was longer and deeper than it seemed . some way down they
found a few [???] and [???] trees [???] the first they had seen for days :
twisted birch for the most part [???] with here and there a fir - tree . many were
dead and gaunt [???] bitten to the core by the eastern winds . once in milder days
there must have been a fair thicket in the ravine [???] but now [???] after some fifty
yards [???] the trees came to an end [???] though old broken stumps [???] on
almost to the cliff ' s brink . the bottom of the gully [???] which lay along the
edge of a rock - fault [???] was rough with broken stone and [???] steeply down .
when they came at last to the end of it [???] [???] stooped and leaned out .
` look ! ' he said . ` we must have come down a long way [???] or else the cliff
has sunk . it ' s much lower here than it was [???] and it looks easier too . '
sam knelt beside him and peered [???] over the edge . then he
glanced up at the great cliff rising up [???] away on their left . ` easier ! ' he
[???] . ` well [???] i suppose it ' s always easier getting down than up . those as
can ' t fly can jump ! '
` it would be a big jump still [???] ' said [???] . ` about [???] well ' - - he stood
for a moment measuring it with his eyes - - ` about eighteen fathoms i should
guess . not more . '
' and that ' s enough ! ' said sam . ` ugh ! how i do hate looking down from a
height ! but looking ' s better than climbing . '
` all the same [???] ' said [???] [???] ` i think we could climb here ; and i think
we shall have to try . see - - the rock is quite different from what it was a
few miles back . it has slipped and cracked . '
the outer fall was indeed no longer sheer [???] but [???] outwards a
little . it looked like a great rampart or sea - wall whose foundations had
shifted [???] so that its courses were all twisted and disordered [???] leaving great
[???] and long [???] edges that were in places almost as wide as
stairs .
` and if we ' re going to try and get down [???] we had better try at once .
it ' s getting dark early . i think there ' s a storm coming . '
the smoky blur of the mountains in the east was lost in a deeper
blackness that was already reaching out westwards with long arms . there was
a distant mutter of thunder borne on the rising breeze . [???] [???] the

air and looked up doubtfully at the sky . he strapped his belt outside his
cloak and tightened it [???] and settled his light pack on his back ; then he
stepped towards the edge . ` i ' m going to try it [???] ' he said .
` very good ! ' said sam [???] . ` but i ' m going first . '
' you ? ' said [???] . ` what ' s made you change your mind about climbing ? '
' i haven ' t changed my mind . but it ' s only sense : put the one lowest as
is most likely to slip . i don ' t want to come down atop of you a nd knock you
off no sense in killing two with one fall . '
before [???] could stop him [???] he sat down [???] swung his legs over the
brink [???] and twisted round [???] [???] with his toes for a foothold . it is
doubtful if he ever did anything braver in cold blood [???] or more unwise .
' no [???] no ! sam [???] you old ass ! ' said [???] . ` you ' ll kill yourself for
certain going over like that without even a look to see what to make for .
come back ! ' he took sam under the [???] and hauled him up again . ' now [???]
wait a bit and be patient ! ' he said . then he lay on the ground [???] leaning out
and looking down : but the light seemed to be fading quickly [???] although the
sun had not yet set . ' i think we could manage this [???] ' he said presently . ` i
could at any rate ; and you could too . if you kept your head and followed me
carefully . '
` i don ' t know how you can be so sure [???] ' said sam . ` why ! you can ' t see to
the bottom in this light . what if you comes to a place where there ' s nowhere
to put your feet or your hands ? '
' climb back [???] i suppose [???] ' said [???] .
' easy said [???] ' objected sam . ' better wait till morning and more light . '
` no ! not if i can help it [???] ' said [???] with a sudden strange [???] .
` i grudge every hour [???] every minute . i ' m going down to try it out . don ' t you
follow till i come back or call ! '
gripping the stony lip of the fall with his fingers he let himself
gently down [???] until when his arms were almost at full stretch [???] his toes found
a ledge . ' on _ e step down ! ' he said . ' and this ledge broadens out to the
right . i could stand there without a hold . i ' ll - - ' his words were cut short .
the hurrying darkness [???] now gathering great speed [???] rushed up from the
east and swallowed the sky . there was a dry splitting crack of thunder right
overhead . searing lightning smote down into the hills . then came a blast of
savage wind [???] and with it [???] mingling with its roar [???] there came a high shrill
shriek . the [???] had heard just such a cry far away in the marish as they
fled from [???] [???] and even there in the woods of the shire it had frozen

their blood . out here in the waste its terror was far greater : it pierced
them with cold blades of horror and despair [???] stopping heart and breath . sam
fell flat on his face . [???] [???] loosed his hold and put his hands
over his head and ears . he swayed [???] slipped [???] and [???] downwards with a
wailing cry .
sam heard him and [???] with an effort to the edge . ' master [???] master !
' he called . ' master ! ' .
he heard no answer . he found he was shaking all over [???] but he gathered
his breath [???] and once again he shouted : ' master ! ' the wind seemed to blow his
voice back into his throat [???] but as it passed [???] roaring up the gully and away
over the hills [???] a faint answering cry came to his ears :
' all right [???] all right ! i ' m here . but i can ' t see . '
[???] was calling with a weak voice . [???] he was not actually very far
away . he had slid and not fallen [???] and had come up with a jolt to his feet on
a wider ledge not many yards lower down . fortunately the rock - face at this
point leaned well back and the wind had pressed him against the cliff [???] so
that he had not toppled over . he steadied himself a little [???] laying his face
against the cold stone [???] feeling his heart pounding . but either the darkness
had grown complete [???] or else his eyes had lost their sight . all was black
about him . he wondered if he had been struck blind . he took a deep breath .
` come back ! come back ! ' he heard sam ' s voice out of the blackness
above .
` i can ' t [???] ' he said . ` i can ' t see . i can ' t find any hold . i can ' t move
yet . '
` what can i do [???] mr . [???] ? what can i do ? ' shouted sam [???] leaning out
dangerously far . why could not his master see ? it was dim [???] certainly [???] but
not as dark as all that . he could see [???] below him [???] a grey forlorn figure
[???] against the cliff . but he was far out of the reach of any helping
hand .
there was another crack of thunder ; and then the rain came . in a
blinding sheet [???] mingled with hail [???] it drove against the cliff [???] bitter cold .
' i ' m coming down to you [???] ' shouted sam [???] though how he hoped to help in
that way he could not have said .
` no [???] no ! wait ! ' [???] called back [???] more strongly now . ` i shall be
better soon . i feel better already . wait ! you can ' t do anything without a
rope . '
` rope ! ' cried sam [???] talking wildly to himself in his [???] and

relief . ` well [???] if i don ' t deserve to be hung on the end of one as a warning
to [???] ! you ' re nowt but a [???] [???] sam [???] : that ' s what
the
[???] said to me often enough [???] it being a word of his . rope ! '
` stop chattering ! ' cried [???] [???] now recovered enough to feel both
amused and annoyed . ' never mind your [???] ! are you trying to tell yourself
you ' ve got some rope in your pocket ? if so [???] out with it !
` yes [???] mr . [???] [???] in my pack and all . carried it hundreds of miles and
i ' d clean forgotten it ! '
` then get busy and let an end down ! '
quickly sam [???] his pack and [???] in it . there indeed at the
bottom was a coil of the silken - grey rope made by the folk of [???] . he
cast an end to his master . the darkness seemed to lift from [???] ' s eyes [???] or
else his sight was returning . he could see the grey line as it came dangling
down [???] and he thought it had a faint silver sheen . now that he had some point
in the darkness to fix his eyes on [???] he felt less giddy . leaning his weight
forward [???] he made the end fast round his waist [???] and then he grasped the line
with both hands .
sam stepped back and braced his feet against a stump a yard or two from
the edge . half hauled [???] half [???] . [???] came up and threw himself on
the ground .
thunder growled and rumbled in the distance [???] and the rain was still
falling heavily . the [???] [???] away back into the gully ; but they did
not find much shelter there . [???] of water began to run down ; soon they
grew to a spate that [???] and fumed on the stones [???] and spouted out over
the cliff like the [???] of a vast roof .
` i should have been half drowned down there [???] or washed clean off [???] ' said
[???] . ' what a piece of luck you had that rope ! '
` better luck if i ' d thought of it sooner [???] ' said sam . ' maybe you
remember them putting the ropes in the boats [???] as we started off : in the
elvish country . i took a fancy to it [???] and i stowed a coil in my pack . years
ago [???] it seems . [???] it may be a help in many needs [???] [???] he said : [???] [???] or one of
those folk . and he spoke right . '
` a pity i didn ' t think of bringing another length [???] ' said [???] ; ` but i
left the company in such a hurry and confusion . if only we had enough we
could use it to get down . how long is your rope [???] i wonder ? '
sam paid it out slowly [???] measuring it with his arms : ' five [???] ten [???] twenty [???]

thirty ells [???] more or less [???] ' he said .
' who ' d have thought it ! ' [???] exclaimed .
` ah ! who would ? ' said sam . ` elves are wonderful folk . it looks a bit
thin [???] but it ' s tough ; and soft as milk to the hand . packs close too [???] and as
light as light . wonderful folk to be sure ! '
` thirty ells ! ' said [???] considering . ' i believe it would be enough .
if the storm passes before nightfall [???] i ' m going to try it . '
` the rain ' s nearly given over already [???] ' said sam ; ' but don ' t you go
doing anything risky in the dim again [???] mr . [???] ! and i haven ' t got over
that shriek on the wind yet [???] if you have . like a black rider it sounded - but
one up in the air [???] if they can fly . i ' m thinking we ' d best lay up in this
crack till night ' s over . '
' and i ' m thinking that i won ' t spend a moment longer than i need stuck
up on this edge with the eyes of the dark country looking over the marshes [???] '
said [???] .
with that he stood up and went down to the bottom of the gully again .
he looked out . clear sky was growing in the east once more . the skirts of
the storm were lifting [???] ragged and wet [???] and the main battle had passed to
spread its great wings over the emyn muil ; upon which the dark thought of
[???] brooded for a while . thence it turned [???] smiting the vale of [???]
with hail and lightning [???] and casting its shadow upon minas [???] with
threat of war . then [???] lowering in the mountains [???] and gathering its great
spires [???] it rolled on slowly over [???] and the skirts of [???] [???] until far
away the riders on the plain saw its black towers mov ing behind the sun [???] as
they rode into the west . but here [???] over the desert and the reeking marshes
the deep blue sky of evening opened once more [???] and a few [???] stars
appeared [???] like small white holes in the canopy above the [???] moon .
` it ' s good to be able to see again [???] ' said [???] [???] breathing deep . ` do
you know [???] i thought for a bit that i had lost my sight ? from the lightning
or something else worse . i could see nothing [???] nothing at all [???] until the grey
rope came down . it seemed to [???] somehow . '
` it does look sort of silver in the dark [???] ' said sam . ` never noticed it
before [???] though i can ' t remember as i ' ve ever had it out since i first stowed
it . but if you ' re so set on climbing [???] mr . [???] [???] how are you going to use
it ? thirty ells [???] or say [???] about eighteen fathom : that ' s no more than your
guess at the height of the cliff . '
[???] thought for a while . ` make it fast to that stump [???] sam ! ' he said .

` then i think you shall have your wish this time and go first . i ' ll lower
you [???] and you need do no more than use your feet and hands to fend yourself
off the rock . though [???] if you put your weight on some of the ledges and give
me a rest [???] it will help . when you ' re down [???] i ' ll follow . i feel quite myself
again now . '
' very well [???] ' said sam heavily . ` if it must be [???] let ' s get it over ! ' he
took up the rope and made it fast over the stump nearest to the brink ; then
the other end he tied about his own waist . [???] he turned and
prepared to go over the edge a second time .
it did not [???] however [???] turn out half as bad as he had expected . the rope
seemed to give him confidence [???] though he shut his eyes more than once when
he looked down between his feet . there was one [???] spot [???] where there
was
no ledge and the wa ll was sheer and even [???] for a short space ; there
he slipped and swung out on the silver line . but [???] lowered him slowly
and steadily [???] and it was over at last . his chief fear had been that the
rope - length would give out while he was still high up [???] but there was still a
good bight in [???] ' s hands [???] when sam came to the bottom and called up : ` i ' m
down ! ' his voice came up clearly from below [???] but [???] could not see him ;
his grey elven - cloak had melted into the [???] .
[???] took rather more time to follow him . he had the rope about his
waist and it was fast above [???] and he had shortened it so that it would pull
him up before he reached the ground ; still he did not want to risk a fall [???]
and he had not quite sam ' s faith in this slender grey line . he found two
places [???] all the same [???] where he had to trust wholly to it : smooth surfaces
where there was no hold even for his strong hobbit fingers and the ledges
were far apart . but at last he too was down .
` well ! ' he cried . ` we ' ve done it ! we ' ve escaped from the emyn muil ! and
now what next [???] i wonder ? maybe we shall soon be sighing for good hard rock
under foot again . '
but sam did not answer : he was staring back up the cliff .
` [???] ! ' he said . ` [???] ! my beautiful rope ! there it is tied to a
stump [???] and we ' re at the bottom . just as nice a little stair for that
slinking [???] as we could leave . better put up a [???] to say which way
we ' ve gone ! i thought it seemed a bit too easy . '
` if you can think of any way we could have both used the rope and yet
brought it down with us [???] then you can pass on to me [???] [???] or any

other name your [???] gave you [???] ' said [???] . ` climb up and untie it and let
yourself down [???] if you want to ! '
sam scratched his head . ` no [???] i can ' t think how [???] begging your pardon [???] '
he said . ` but i don ' t like leaving it [???] and that ' s a fact . ' he stroked the
rope ' s end and shook it gently . ` it goes hard parting with anything i
brought out of the elf - country . made by [???] herself [???] too [???] maybe .
[???] [???] ' he murmured nodding his head mournfully . he looked up and gave
one last pull to the rope as if in farewell .
to the complete surprise of both the [???] it came loose . sam fell
over [???] and the long grey coils [???] silently down on top of him . [???]
laughed . ` who tied the rope ? ' he said . ` a good thing it held as long as it
did ! to think that i trusted all my weight to your knot ! '
sam did not laugh . ` i may not be much good at climbing [???] mr . [???] [???] ' he
said in injured tones [???] ` but i do know something about rope and about knots .
it ' s in the family [???] as you might say . why [???] my grand - dad [???] and my uncle andy
after him [???] him that was the [???] ' s eldest brother he had a rope - walk over
by [???] many a year . and i put as fast a hitch over the stump as any
one could have done [???] in the shire or out of it . '
` then the rope must have broken - - frayed on the rock - edge [???] i expect [???] '
said [???] .
` i bet it didn ' t ! ' said sam in an even more injured voice . he stooped
and examined the ends . ` nor it hasn ' t neither . not a strand ! '
' then i ' m afraid it must have been the knot [???] ' said [???] .
sam shook his head and did not answer . he was passing the rope through
his fingers thoughtfully . ` have it your own way [???] mr . [???] [???] ' he said at
last [???] ` but i think the rope came off itself - - when i called . ' he coiled it
up and stowed it lovingly in his pack .
' it certainly came [???] ' said [???] [???] ` and that ' s the chief thing . but now
we ' ve got to think of our next move . night will be on us soon . how beautiful
the stars are [???] and the moon ! '
' they do cheer the heart [???] don ' t they ? ' said sam looking up . ' elvish
they are . somehow . and the moon ' s growing . we haven ' t seen him for a night
or two in this cloudy weather . he ' s beginning to give quite a light . '
' yes [???] ' said [???] ; ` but he won ' t be full for some days . i don ' t think
we ' ll try the marshes by the light of half a moon . '
under the first shadows of night they started out on the next stage of
their journey . after a while sam turned and looked back at the way they had

come . the mouth of the gully was a black notch in the dim cliff . ` i ' m glad
we ' ve got the rope [???] ' he said . ' we ' ve set a little [???] for that [???] [???]
anyhow . he can try his [???] [???] feet on those ledges ! '
they picked their steps away from the skirts of the cliff [???] among a
wilderness of [???] and rough stones [???] wet and slippery with the heavy
rain . the ground still fell away sharply . they had not gone very far when
they came upon a great [???] that yawned suddenly black before their feet .
it was not wide [???] but it was too wide to jump across in the dim light . they
thought they could hear water [???] in its depths . it curved away on
their left northward [???] back towards the hills . and so barred their road in
that direction [???] at any rate while darkness lasted .
' we had better try a way back southwards along the line of the cliff [???] i
think [???] ' said sam . ` we might find some nook there [???] or even a cave or
something . '
' i suppose so [???] ' said [???] . ' i ' m tired . and i don ' t think i can
scramble among stones much longer tonight - - though i grudge the delay . i
wish there was a clear path in front of us : then i ' d go on till my legs gave
way . '
they did not find the going any easier at the broken feet of the emyn
muil . nor did sam find any nook or hollow to shelter in : only bare stony
[???] frowned over by the cliff [???] which now rose again [???] higher and more
sheer as they went back . in the end [???] worn out [???] they just cast themselves on
the ground under the lee of a [???] lying not far from the foot of the
[???] . there for some time they sat [???] mournfully together in the
cold stony night [???] while sleep crept upon them in spite of all they could do
to hold it off . the moon now rode high and clear . its thin white light lit
up the faces of the rocks and drenched the cold frowning walls of the cliff [???]
turning all the wide looming darkness into a chill pale grey scored with
black shadows .
' well ! ' said [???] [???] standing up and drawing his cloak more closely
round him . ` you sleep for a bit sam and take my blanket . i ' ll walk up and
down on sentry for a while . ' suddenly he stiffened [???] and stooping he gripped
sam by the arm . ` what ' s that ? ' he whispered . ` look over there on the
cliff ! '
sam looked and breathed in sharply through his teeth . ` [???] ! ' he said .
' that ' s what it is . it ' s that [???] ! snakes and adders ! and to think tha t i
thought that we ' d [???] him with our bit of a climb ! look at him ! like a

[???] [???] spider on a wall . '
down the face of a [???] [???] sheer and almost smooth it seemed in the
pale moonlight [???] a small black shape was moving with its thin limbs [???]
out . maybe its soft [???] hands and toes were finding [???] and holds
that no hobbit could ever have seen or used [???] but it looked as if it was just
creeping down on sticky pads [???] like some large [???] thing of insect - kind .
and it was coming down head first [???] as if it was smelling its way . now and
again it lifted its head slowly [???] turning it right back on its long skinny
neck [???] and the [???] caught a glimpse of two small pale gleaming lights [???]
its eyes that [???] at the moon for a moment and then were quickly [???]
again .
` do you think he can see us ? ' said sam .
` i don ' t know [???] ' said [???] quietly [???] ` but i think not . it is hard even
for friendly eyes to see these elven - cloaks : i cannot see you in the shadow
even at a few paces . and i ' ve heard that he doesn ' t like sun or moon . '
` then why is he coming down just here ? ' asked sam .
' quietly [???] sam ! ' said [???] . ` he can smell us [???] perhaps . and he can hear
as keen as elves [???] i believe . i think he has heard something now : our voices
probably . we did a lot of shouting away back there ; and we were talking far
too loudly until a minute ago . '
` well [???] i ' m sick of him [???] ' said sam . ` he ' s come once too often for me and
i ' m going to have a word with him [???] if i can . i don ' t suppose we could give
him the slip now anyway . ' drawing his grey hood well over his face [???] sam
crept [???] towards the cliff .
` careful ! ' whispered [???] coming behind . ` don ' t alarm him ! he ' s much
more dangerous than he looks . '
the black [???] shape was now three - quarters of the way down [???] and
perhaps fifty feet or less above the cliff ' s foot . [???] stone - still in
the shadow of a large [???] the [???] watched him . he seemed to have
come to a difficult passage or to be troubled about something . they could
hear him snuffling [???] and now and again there was a harsh hiss of breath that
sounded like a curse . he lifted his head [???] and they thought they heard him
spit . then he moved on again . now they could hear his voice creaking and
whistling .
` ach [???] sss ! [???] [???] my precious ! more haste less speed . we [???] ' t
[???] our neck [???] musst we [???] precious ? no [???] precious - - [???] ! ' he lifted his
head again [???] [???] at the moon [???] and quickly shut his eyes . ` we hate it [???] ' he

[???] . ` [???] [???] [???] shivery light it is - - sss - - it spies on us [???]
precious - - it hurts our eyes . '
he was getting lower now and the hisses became sharper and clearer .
' where iss it [???] where iss it : my precious [???] my precious ? it ' s ours [???] it is [???] and
we wants it . the thieves [???] the thieves [???] the filthy little thieves . where are
they with my precious ? curse them ! we hates them . '
` it doesn ' t sound as if he knew we were here [???] does it ? ' whispered sam .
` and what ' s his precious ? does he mean the '
` hsh ! ' breathed [???] . ' he ' s getting near now [???] near enough to hear a
whisper . '
indeed [???] had suddenly paused again [???] and his large head on its
scrawny neck was lolling from side to side as if he was listening . his pale
eyes were half [???] . sam restrained himself [???] though his fingers were
[???] . his eyes [???] filled with anger and disgust [???] were fixed on the
wretched creature as he now began to move again [???] still whispering and
hissing to himself .
at last he wa s no more than a dozen feet from the ground [???] right above
their heads . from that point there was a sheer drop [???] for the cliff was
slightly [???] [???] and even [???] could not find a hold of any kind . he
seemed to be trying to twist round [???] so as to go legs first [???] when suddenly
with a shrill whistling shriek he fell . as he did so [???] he curled his legs and
arms up round him [???] like a spider whose descending thread is snapped .
sam was out of his hiding in a flash and crossed the space between him
and the cliff foot in a couple of leaps . before [???] could get up [???] he was
on top of him . but he found [???] more than he bargained for [???] even taken
like that [???] suddenly [???] off his guard after a fall . before sam could get a
hold [???] long legs and arms were wound round him pinning his arms [???] and a
[???] grip [???] soft but horribly strong [???] was [???] him like slowly
tightening cords ; [???] fingers were feeling for his throat . then sharp
teeth bit into his shoulder . all he could do was to butt his hard round head
sideways into the creature ' s face . [???] [???] and spat [???] but he did not
let go .
things would have gone ill with sam [???] if he had been alone . but [???]
sprang up [???] and drew sting from its sheath . with his left hand he drew back
[???] ' s head by his thin lank hair [???] stretching his long neck [???] and forcing
his pale venomous eyes to stare up at the sky .
` let go ! [???] [???] ' he said . ` this is sting . you have seen it before once

upon a time . let go [???] or you ' ll feel it this time ! i ' ll cut your throat . '
[???] [???] and went as loose as wet string . sam got up [???] fingering
his shoulder . his eyes [???] with anger [???] but he could not avenge
himself : his miserable enemy lay grovelling on the stones [???] .
` don ' t hurt us ! don ' t let them hurt us [???] precious ! they won ' t hurt us
will they [???] nice little [???] ? we didn ' t mean no harm [???] but they jumps on
us like cats on poor mices [???] they did [???] precious . and we ' re so lonely [???] [???] .
we ' ll be nice to them [???] very nice [???] if they ' ll be nice to us [???] won ' t we [???] yes [???]
yess . '
` well [???] what ' s to be done with it ? ' said sam . ` tie it up [???] so as it
can ' t come sneaking after us no more [???] i say . '
` but that would kill us [???] kill us [???] ' [???] [???] . ` cruel little
[???] . tie us up in the cold hard lands and leave us [???] [???] [???] [???] . '
sobs welled up in his [???] throat .
` no [???] ' said [???] . ` if we kill him [???] we must kill him outright . but we
can ' t do that [???] not as things are . poor wretch ! he has done us no harm . '
` oh hasn ' t he ! ' said sam rubbing his shoulder . ` anyway he meant to [???]
and he means to [???] i ' ll warrant . [???] us in our sleep [???] that ' s his plan . '
' i daresay [???] ' said [???] . ` but what he means to do is another matter . '
he paused for a while in thought . [???] lay still [???] but stopped [???] .
sam stood glowering over him .
it seemed to [???] then that he heard [???] quite plainly but far off [???]
voices out of the past :
what a pity [???] did not stub the vile creature [???] when he had a chance !
pity ? it was pity that stayed his hand . pity [???] and mercy : not to strike
without need .
i do not feel any pity for [???] . he deserves death .
deserves death ! i daresay he does . many that live deserve death . and
some die that deserve life . can you give that to them ? then be not too eager
to deal out death in the name of justice [???] fearing for your own safety . even
the wise cannot see all ends .
` very well [???] ' he answered aloud [???] lowering his sword . ' but still i am
afraid . and yet [???] as you see [???] i will not touch the creature . for now that i
see him [???] i do pity him . '
sam stared at his master [???] who seemed to be speaking to some one who was
not there . [???] lifted his head .
' yess [???] wretched we are [???] precious [???] ' he whined . ' misery misery ! [???]

won ' t kill us [???] nice [???] . '
' no [???] we won ' t [???] ' said [???] . ` but we won ' t let you go [???] either . you ' re
full of wickedness and mischief [???] [???] . you will have to come with us [???]
that ' s all [???] while we keep an eye on you . but you must help us [???] if you can .
one good turn deserves another . '
' yess [???] yes indeed [???] ' said [???] sitting up . ' nice [???] ! we will come
with them . find them safe paths in the dark [???] yes we will . and where are they
going in these cold hard lands [???] we wonders [???] yes we wonders ? ' he looked up
at them [???] and a faint light of cunning and eagerness [???] for a second
in his pale blinking eyes .
sam [???] at him [???] and sucked his teeth ; but he seemed to sense that
there was something odd about his master ' s mood and that the matter was
beyond argument . all the same he was amazed at [???] ' s reply .
[???] looked straight into [???] ' s eyes which flinched and twisted
away . ` you know that [???] or you guess well enough [???] [???] [???] ' he said . quietly
and sternly . ` we are going to [???] [???] of course . and you know the way there [???]
i believe . '
` ach ! sss ! ' said [???] [???] covering his ears with his hands [???] as if such
frankness [???] and the open speaking of the names [???] hurt him . ` we guessed [???] yes we
guessed [???] ' he whispered ; ` and we didn ' t want them to go [???] did we ? no [???]
precious [???] not the nice [???] . ashes [???] ashes [???] and dust [???] and thirst there is ;
and pits [???] pits [???] pits [???] and [???] [???] thousands of [???] . nice [???] mustn ' t go
to - - sss - - those places . '
` so you have been there ? ' [???] insisted . ` and you ' re being drawn back
there [???] aren ' t you ? '
` yess . yess . no ! ' shrieked [???] . ` once [???] by accident it was [???] wasn ' t
it [???] precious ? yes [???] by accident . but we won ' t go back [???] no [???] no ! ' then suddenly
his voice and language changed [???] and he [???] in his throat [???] and spoke but
not to them . ` leave me alone [???] [???] ! you hurt me . o my poor hands [???] [???] !
i [???] we [???] i don ' t want to come back . i can ' t find it . i am tired . i [???] we can ' t
find it [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] no [???] nowhere . they ' re always awake . [???] [???] men [???]
and elves [???] terrible elves with bright eyes . i can ' t find it . ach ! ' he got
up and [???] his long hand into a bony fleshless knot [???] shaking it towards
the east . ' we won ' t ! ' he cried . ' not for you . ' then he [???] again .
' [???] [???] [???] [???] ' he [???] with his face to the ground . ' don ' t look at
us ! go away ! go to sleep ! '
` he will not go away or go to sleep at your command [???] [???] [???] ' said

[???] . ` but if you really wish to be free of him again . then you must help
me . and that i fear means finding us a path towards him . but you need not go
all the way [???] not beyond the gates of his land . '
[???] sat up again and looked at him under his eyelids . ' he ' s over
there [???] ' he [???] . ` always there . [???] wi ll take you all the way . easy to
find [???] east of the river . don ' t ask [???] . poor [???] poor [???] [???] he went
away long ago . they took his precious [???] and he ' s lost now . '
` perhaps we ' ll find him again [???] if you come with us [???] ' said [???] .
' no [???] no [???] never ! he ' s lost his precious [???] ' said [???] .
' get up ! ' said [???] .
[???] stood up and backed away against the cliff .
` now ! ' said [???] . ' can you find a path easier by day or by night ?
we ' re tired ; but if you choose the night [???] we ' ll star t tonight . '
` the big lights hurt our eyes [???] they do [???] ' [???] whined . ` not under the
white face [???] not yet . it will go behind the hills soon [???] yess . rest a bit
first [???] nice [???] ! '
` then sit down [???] ' said [???] [???] ` and don ' t move ! '
the [???] seated themselves beside him [???] one on either side . with
their backs to the stony wall [???] resting their legs . there was no need for any
arrangement by word : they knew that they must not sleep for a moment . slowly
the moon went by . shadows fell down from the hills [???] and all grew dark before
them . the stars grew thick and bright in the sky above . no one stirred .
[???] sat with his legs drawn up [???] knees under chin [???] flat hands and feet
[???] on the ground [???] his eyes closed ; but he seemed tense [???] as if thinking
or listening .
[???] looked across at sam . their eyes met and they understood . they
[???] [???] leaning their heads back [???] and shutting their eyes or seeming to .
soon the sound of their soft breathing could be heard . [???] ' s hands
[???] a little . hardly [???] his head moved to the left and the
right [???] and first one eye and then the other opened a slit . the [???] made
no sign .
suddenly [???] with startling agility and speed [???] straight off the ground
with a jump like a [???] or a frog . [???] bounded forward into the
darkness . but that was just what [???] and sam had expected . sam was on
him
before he had gone two paces after his spring . [???] coming behind [???]
his leg and threw him .

' your rope might prove useful again [???] sam . ' he said .
sam got out the rope . ' and where were you off to in the cold hard
lands [???] mr . [???] ? ' he growled . ' we wonders . aye [???] we wonders . to find
some
of your orc - friends [???] i warrant . you [???] treacherous creature . it ' s round
your neck this rope ought to go [???] and a tight noose too . '
[???] lay quiet and tried no further tricks . he did not answer sam [???]
but gave him a swift venomous look .
` all we need is something to keep a hold on him [???] ' said [???] . ' we want
him to walk [???] so it ' s no good tying his legs - or his arms . he seems to use
them nearly as much . tie one end to his ankle [???] and keep a grip on the other
end . '
he stood over [???] [???] while sam tied the knot . the result surprised
them both . [???] began to scream [???] a thin [???] tearing sound [???] very horrible to
hear . he [???] [???] and tried to get his mouth to his ankle and bite the rope .
he kept on screaming .
at last [???] was convinced that he really was in pain ; but it could
not be from the knot . he examined it and found that it was not too tight [???]
indeed hardly tight enough . sam was gentler than his words . ' what ' s the
matter with you ? ' he said . ` if you will try to run away . you must be tied ;
but we don ' t wish to hurt you . '
' it hurts us [???] it hurts us [???] ' [???] [???] . ` it freezes [???] it bites ! elves
twisted it [???] curse them ! [???] cruel [???] ! that ' s why we tries to escape [???]
of course it is [???] precious . we guessed they were cruel [???] . they visits
elves [???] fierce elves with bright eyes . take it off us ! it hurts us . '
` no [???] i will not take it off you [???] ' said [???] [???] ` not unless ' - - he paused
a moment in thought - - ` not unless there is any promise you can make that i
can trust . '
' we will swear to do what he wants [???] yes [???] yess [???] said [???] [???] still
twisting and [???] at his ankle . ` it hurts us . '
` swear ? ' said [???] .
' [???] [???] ' said [???] suddenly and clearly [???] opening his eyes wide and
staring at [???] with a strange light . ' [???] will swear on the precious . '
[???] drew himself up [???] and again sam was startled by his words and his
stern voice . ' on the precious ? how dare you ? ' he said . ' think !
one ring to rule them all and in the darkness bind them .
would you commit your promise to that [???] [???] ? it will hold you . but

it is more treacherous than you are . it may twist your words . beware ! '
[???] cowered . ' on the precious . on the precious ! ' he repeated .
` and what would you swear ? ' asked [???] .
` to be very very good [???] ' said [???] . then [???] to [???] ' s feet he
grovelled before him [???] whispering [???] : a shudder ran over him [???] as if the
words shook his very bones with fear . ' [???] will swear never [???] never [???] to
let him have it . never ! [???] will save it . but he must swear on the
precious . '
' no ! not on it [???] ' said [???] [???] looking down at him with stern pity . ' all
you wish is to see it and touch it [???] if you can [???] though you know it would
drive you mad . not on it . swear by it [???] if you will . for you know where it
is . yes [???] you know [???] [???] . it is before you . '
for a moment it appeared to sam that his master had grown and [???]
had shrunk : a tall stern shadow [???] a mighty lord who hid his brightness in
grey cloud [???] and at his feet a little whining dog . yet the two were in some
way akin and not alien : they could reach one another ' s minds . [???] raised
himself and began [???] at [???] [???] fawning at his knees .
' down ! down ! ' said [???] . ` now speak your promise ! '
` we promises [???] yes i promise ! ' said [???] . ' i will serve the master of
the precious . good master [???] good [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] ! ' suddenly he began
to weep and bite at his ankle again .
' take the rope off [???] sam ! ' said [???] .
[???] sam obeyed . at once [???] got up and began prancing about [???]
like a whipped cur whose master has patted it . from that moment a change [???]
which lasted for some time [???] came over him . he spoke with less hissing and
whining [???] and he spoke to his companions direct [???] not to his precious self . he
would cringe and flinch [???] if they stepped near him or made any sudden
movement [???] and he avoided the touch of their elven - cloaks ; but he was
friendly [???] and indeed pitifully anxious to please . he would [???] with
laughter and caper [???] if any jest was made [???] or even if [???] spoke kindly to
him [???] and weep if [???] rebuked him . sam said little to him of any sort . he
suspected him more deeply than ever [???] and if possible liked the new [???] [???]
the [???] [???] less than the old .
' well [???] [???] [???] or whatever it is we ' re to call you [???] ' he said . ' now for
it ! the moon ' s gone . and the night ' s going . we ' d better start . '
' yes [???] yes [???] ' agreed [???] [???] skipping about . ' off we go ! there ' s only one
way across between the north - end and the south - end . i found it [???] i did . [???]

don ' t use it [???] [???] don ' t know it . [???] don ' t cross the marshes [???] they go
round for miles and miles . very lucky you came this way . very lucky you
found [???] [???] yes . follow [???] ! '
he took a few steps away and looked back [???] [???] like a dog
inviting them for a walk . ' wait a bit [???] [???] ! ' cried sam . ` not too far
ahead now ! i ' m going to be at your tail [???] and i ' ve got the rope handy . '
' no [???] no ! ' said [???] . ' [???] promised . '
in the deep of night under hard clear stars they set off . [???] led
them back northward for a while along the way they had come ; then he [???]
to the right away from the steep edge of the emyn muil [???] down the broken
stony [???] towards the vast fens below . they faded swiftly and softly into
the darkness . over all the leagues of waste before the gates of [???] there
was a black silence .




chapter 2 . the passage of the marshes



[???] moved quickly [???] with his head and neck thrust forward [???] often
using his hands as well as his feet . [???] and sam were hard put to it to
keep up with him ; but he seemed no longer to have any thought of escaping [???]
and if they fell behind [???] he would turn and wait for them . after a time he
brought them to the brink of the narrow gully that they had struck before ;
but they were now further from the hills .
` here it is ! ' he cried . ' there is a way down inside [???] yes . now we
follows it - - out [???] out away over there . ' he pointed south and east towards
the marshes . the reek of them came to their [???] [???] heavy and foul even in
the cool night air . .
[???] cast up and down along the brink [???] and at length he called to
them . ` here ! we can get down here . [???] went this way once : i went this
way [???] hiding from [???] . '
he led the way [???] and following him the [???] climbed down into the
gloom . it was not difficult [???] for the rift was at this point only some
fifteen feet deep and about a dozen across . there was running water at the
bottom : it was in fact the bed of one of the many small rivers that trickled
down from the hills to feed the [???] [???] and mires beyond . [???]
turned to the right [???] southward more or less [???] and [???] along with his
feet in the shallow stony stream . he seemed greatly delighted to feel the
water [???] and [???] to himself [???] sometimes even croaking in a sort of song .
the cold hard lands [???]
they bites our hands [???]
they gnaws our feet .
the rocks and stones
are like old bones
all bare of meat .
but stream and pool
is wet and cool :
so nice for feet !
and now we wish - -
' ha ! ha ! what does we wish ? ' he said [???] looking sidelong at the [???] .
' we ' ll tell you . ' he croaked . ` he guessed it long ago [???] [???] guessed it . '
a glint came into his eyes [???] and sam catching the gleam in the darkness

thought it far from pleasant .
alive without breath ;
as cold as death ;
never thirsting [???] ever drinking ;
clad in mail [???] never clinking .
drowns on dry land [???]
thinks an island
is a mountain ;
thinks a fountain
is a puff of air .
so sleek [???] so fair !
what a joy to meet !
we only wish
to catch a fish [???]
so [???] - sweet !
these words only made more pressing to sam ' s mind a problem that had
been troubl ing him from the moment when he understood that hir master was
going to adopt [???] as a guide : the problem of food . it did not occur to
him that his master might also have thought of it . hut he supposed [???]
had . indeed how had [???] kept himself in all his lonely wandering ? ' not
too well [???] ' thought sam . ' he looks fair famished . not too dainty to try what
hobbit tastes like if there ain ' t no fish [???] i ' ll wager - - supposing as he
could catch us napping . well [???] he won ' t : not sam [???] for one . '
they [???] along in the dark winding gully for a long time [???] or so it
seemed to the tired feet of [???] and sam . the gully turned eastward [???] and as
they went on it broadened and got gradually shallower . at last the sky above
grew faint with the first grey of morning . [???] had shown no signs of
tiring [???] but now he looked up and halted .
` day is near [???] ' he whispered [???] as if day was something that might
[???] him and spring on him . ` [???] will stay here : i will stay here [???]
and the yellow face won ' t see me . '
` we should be glad to see the sun ; ' said [???] [???] ` but we will stay here :
we are too tired to go any further at present . '
` you are not wise to be glad of the yellow face [???] ' said [???] . ` it
shows you up . nice sensible [???] stay with [???] . [???] and [???] things
are about . they can see a long way . stay and hide with me ! '
the three of them settled down to rest at the foot of the rocky wall of

the gully . it was not much more than a tall man ' s height now [???] and at its
base there were wide flat shelves of dry stone ; the water ran in a channel
on the other side . [???] and sam sat on one of the flats [???] resting their
backs . [???] [???] and [???] in the stream .
` we must take a little food [???] ' said [???] . ` are you hungry [???] [???] ? we
have very little to share [???] but we will spare you what we can . '
at the word hungry a greenish light was kindled in [???] ' s pale eyes [???]
and they seemed to protrude further than ever from his thin sickly face . for
a moment he [???] into his old [???] - manner . ' we are [???] [???] yes
[???] we are . precious [???] ' he said . ` what is it they eats ? have they nice
[???] ? ' his tongue lolled out between his sharp yellow teeth . licking his
colourless lips .
` no [???] we have got no fish [???] ' said [???] . ` we have only got this ' - - he
held up a wafer of [???] - - ' and water [???] if the water here is fit to drink . '
` yess [???] yess [???] nice water [???] ' said [???] . ` drink it [???] drink it [???] while we
can ! but what is it they ' ve got [???] pr ecious ? is it [???] ? is it [???] ? '
[???] broke off a portion of a wafer and handed it to him on its
leaf - wrapping . [???] [???] at the leaf and his face changed : a spasm of
disgust came over it [???] and a hint of his old malice . ` [???] smells it ! ' he
said . ` leaves out of the elf - country [???] gah ! they [???] . he climbed in those
trees [???] and he couldn ' t wash the smell off his hands [???] my nice hands . '
dropping the leaf [???] he took a corner of the [???] and [???] it . he spat [???]
and a fit of coughing shook him .
` ach ! no ! ' he [???] . ` you try to choke poor [???] . dust and
ashes [???] he can ' t eat that . he must starve . but [???] doesn ' t mind . nice
[???] ! [???] has promised . he will starve . he can ' t eat [???] ' food .
he will starve . poor thin [???] ! '
` i ' m sorry [???] ' said [???] ; ` but i can ' t help you [???] i ' m afraid . i think
this food would do you good [???] if you would try . but perhaps you can ' t even
try [???] not yet anyway . '
the [???] [???] their [???] in silence . sam thought that it tasted
far better [???] somehow [???] than it had for a good while : [???] ' s behaviour had
made him attend to its flavour again . but he did not feel comfortable .
[???] watched every morsel from hand to mouth [???] like an expectant dog by a
diner ' s chair . only when they had finished and were preparing to rest [???] was
he apparently convinced that they had no hidden dainties that he could share
in . then he went and sat by himself a few paces away and [???] a little .

' look here ! ' sam whispered to [???] [???] not too softly : he did not really
care whether [???] heard him or not . ` we ' ve got to get some sleep ; but not
both together with that hungry villain nigh [???] promise or no promise . [???]
or [???] [???] he won ' t change his habits in a hurry [???] i ' ll warrant . you go to
sleep [???] mr . [???] [???] and i ' ll call you when i can ' t keep my eyelids propped up .
turn and about [???] same as before [???] while he ' s loose . '
' perhaps you ' re right [???] sam [???] ' said [???] speaking openly . ' there is a
change in him [???] but just what kind of a change and how deep [???] i ' m not sure
yet . seriously though [???] i don ' t think there is any need for fear - - at
present . still watch if you wish . give me about two hours [???] not more [???] and
then call me . '
so tired was [???] that his head fell forward on his breast and he
slept . almost as soon as he had spoken the words . [???] seemed no longer to
have any fears . he curled up and went quickly to sleep [???] quite [???] .
presently his breath was hissing softly through his [???] teeth [???] hut he
lay still as stone . after a while [???] fearing that he would drop off himself [???]
if he sat listening to his two companions breathing [???] sam got up and gently
prodded [???] . his hands [???] and [???] [???] but he made no other
movement . sam bent down and said [???] close to his ear [???] but there was no
response [???] not even a catch in [???] ' s breathing .
sam scratched his head . ` must really be asleep [???] ' he muttered . ` and if i
was like [???] [???] he wouldn ' t wake up never aga in . ' he restrained the
thoughts of his sword and the rope that sprang to his mind [???] and went and sat
down by his master .
when he woke up the sky above was dim [???] not lighter but darker than when
they had breakfasted . sam leapt to his feet . not least from his own feeling
of vigour and hunger [???] he suddenly understood that he had slept the daylight
away [???] nine hours at least . [???] was still fast asleep [???] lying now stretched
on his side . [???] was not to be seen . various reproachful names for
himself came to sam ' s mind [???] drawn from the [???] ' s large [???]
word - hoard ; then it also occurred to him that his master had been right :
there had for the present been nothing to guard against . they were at any
rate both alive and [???] .
' poor wretch ! ' he said half remorsefully . ' now i wonder where he ' s got
to ? '
' not far [???] not far ! ' said a voice above him . he looked up and saw the
shape of [???] ' s large head and ears against the evening sky .

' here [???] what are you doing ? ' cried sam [???] his suspicions coming back as
soon as he saw that shape .
` [???] is hungry [???] ' said [???] . ` be back soon . '
' come back now ! ' shouted sam . ' hi ! come back ! ' but [???] had vanished .
[???] woke at the sound of sam ' s shout and sat up [???] rubbing his eyes .
' hullo ! ' he said . ' anything wrong ? what ' s the time ? '
' i dunno [???] ' said sam . ' after sundown [???] i reckon . and he ' s gone off . says
he ' s hungry . '
` don ' t worry ! ' said [???] . ` there ' s no help for it . but he ' ll come
back [???] you ' ll see . the promise will hold yet a while . and he won ' t leave his
precious [???] anyway . '
[???] made light of it when he learned that they had slept soundly for
hours with [???] [???] and a very hungry [???] too [???] loose beside them . ` don ' t
think of any of your [???] ' s hard names [???] ' he said . ' you were worn out [???] and
it has turned out well : we are now both rested . and we have a hard road
ahead [???] the worst road of all . '
` about the food [???] ' said sam . ' how long ' s it going to take us to do this
job ? and when it ' s done [???] what are we going to do then ? this [???] keeps
you on your legs in a wonderful way [???] though it doesn ' t satisfy the innards
proper [???] as you might say : not to my feeling anyhow [???] meaning no [???] to
them as made it . but you have to eat some of it every day [???] and it doesn ' t
grow . i reckon we ' ve got enough to last [???] say [???] three weeks or so [???] and that
with a tight belt and a light tooth [???] mind you . we ' ve been a bit free with it
so far . '
` i don ' t know how long we shall take to - - to finish [???] ' said [???] . ` we
were miserably delayed in the hills . but [???] [???] [???] my dear hobbit - -
indeed [???] sam my dearest hobbit [???] friend of friends - - i do not think we need
give thought to what comes after that . to do the job as you put it - - what
hope is there that we ever shall ? and if we do [???] who knows what will come of
that ? if the one goes into the fire [???] and we are at hand ? i ask you [???] sam [???] are
we ever likely to need bread again ? i think not . if we can nurse our limbs
to bring us to mount doom [???] that is all we can do . more than i can [???] i begin
to feel . '
sam nodded silently . he took his master ' s hand and bent over it . he did
not kiss it [???] though his tears fell on it . then he turned away [???] drew his
sleeve over his nose [???] and got up [???] a nd stamped about [???] trying to whistle [???] and
saying between the efforts : ' where ' s that [???] creature ? '

it was actually not long before [???] returned ; but he came so quietly
that they did not hear him till he stood before them . his fingers and face
were soiled with black mud . he was still [???] and slavering . what he was
[???] [???] they did not ask or like to think .
' worms or beetles or something [???] out of holes [???] ' thought sam . ' brr !
the [???] creature ; the poor wretch ! '
[???] said nothing to them [???] until he had drunk deeply and washed
himself in the stream . then he came up to them [???] licking his lips . ' better
now [???] ' he said . ` are we rested ? ready to go on ? nice [???] [???] they sleep
beautifully . trust [???] now ? very [???] very good . '
the next stage of their journey was much the same as the last . as they
went on the gully became ever shallower and the slope of its floor more
gradual . its bottom was less stony and more earthy [???] and slowly its sides
[???] to mere ba nks . it began to wind and wander . that night drew to its
end [???] but clouds were now over moon and star [???] and they knew of the coming of
day only by the slow spreading of the thin grey light .
in a chill hour they came to the end of the water - course . the banks
became moss - grown mounds . over the last shelf of rotting stone the stream
[???] and fell down into a brown bog and was lost . dry reeds [???] and
rattled though they could feel no wind .
on either side and in front wide fens and m ires now lay [???] stretching
away southward and eastward into the dim half - light . mists curled and smoked
from dark and noisome [???] . the reek of them hung [???] in the still
air . far away [???] now almost due south [???] the mountain - walls of [???] loomed [???]
like a black bar of rugged clouds floating above a dangerous fog - bound sea .
the [???] were now wholly in the hands of [???] . they did now know [???]
and could not guess in that misty light . that they were in fact only just
within the northern borders of the marshes . the main [???] of which lay
south of them . they could [???] if they had known the lands [???] with some delay have
[???] their steps a little [???] and then turning east have come round over
hard roads to the bare plain of [???] : the field of the ancient battle
before the gates of [???] . not that there was great hope in such a course .
on that stony plain there was no cover [???] and across it ran the highways of
the [???] and the soldiers of the enemy . not even the cloaks of [???] would
have concealed them there .
' how do we shape our course now [???] [???] ? ' asked [???] . ' must we cross
these evil - smelling fens ? '

` no need [???] no need at all [???] ' said [???] . ' not if [???] want to reach
the dark mountains and go to see him very quick . back a little [???] and round a
little ' - - his skinny arm waved north and east - - ` and you can come on hard
cold roads to the very gates of his country . lots of his people will be
there looking out for guests [???] very pleased to take them straight to him [???] o
yes . his eye watches that way all the time . it caught [???] there [???] long
ago . ' [???] [???] . ' but [???] has used his eyes since then [???] yes [???] yes :
i ' ve used eyes and feet and nose since then . l know other ways . more
difficult [???] not so quick ; but better [???] if we don ' t want him to see . follow
[???] ! he can take you through the marshes [???] through the mists . nice thick
mists . follow [???] very carefully [???] and you may go a long way . quite a
long way [???] before he catches you [???] yes perhaps . '
it was already day [???] a windless and sullen morning [???] and the marsh - reeks
lay in heavy banks . no sun pierced the low clouded sky [???] and [???] seemed
anxious to continue the journey at once . so after a brief rest they set out
again and were soon lost in a shadowy silent world [???] cut off from all view of
the lands about [???] either the hills that they had left or the mountains that
they sought . they went slowly in single file : [???] [???] sam [???] [???] .
[???] seemed the most weary of the three [???] and slow though they went . he
often lagged . the [???] soon found that what had looked like one vast fen
was really an endless network of [???] [???] and soft mires . and winding
half - strangled water - courses . among these a cunning eye and foot could
thread a wandering path . [???] certainly had that cunning [???] and needed all
of it . his head on its long neck was ever turning this way and that [???] while
he [???] and muttered all the time to himself . sometimes he would hold up
his hand and halt them [???] while he went forward a little [???] [???] [???] testing
the ground with fingers or toes . or merely listening with one ear pressed to
the earth .
it was dreary and [???] . cold [???] winter still held sway in this
forsaken country . the only green was the scum of livid weed on the dark
greasy surfaces of the sullen waters . dead grasses and rotting reeds loomed
up in the mists like ragged shadows of long - forgotten summers .
as the day wore on the light increased a little [???] and the mists lifted [???]
growing thinner and more [???] . far above the rot and vapours of the
world the sun was riding high and golden now in a serene country with floors
of [???] foam [???] but only a passing ghost of her could they see below [???]
bleared [???] pale [???] giving no colour and no warmth . but even at this faint

reminder of her presence [???] [???] and flinched . he halted their
journey [???] and they rested [???] [???] like little hunted animals [???] in the
borders of a great brown reed - thicket . there was a deep silence [???] only
scraped on its surfaces by the faint quiver of empty seed - plumes [???] and broken
grass - blades trembling in small air - movements that they could not feel .
' not a bird ! ' said sam mournfully .
` no [???] no birds [???] ' said [???] . ` nice birds ! ' he licked his teeth . ' no
birds here . there are [???] [???] wormses [???] things in the [???] . lots of
things [???] lots of [???] things . no birds [???] ' he ended sadly . sam looked at him
with distaste .
so passed the third day of their journey with [???] . before the
shadows of evening were long in happier lands [???] they went on again [???] always on
and on with only brief halts . these they made not so much for rest as to
help [???] ; for now even he had to go forward with great care [???] and he was
sometimes at a loss for a while . they had come to the very midst of the dead
marshes [???] and it was dark .
they walked slowly [???] stooping [???] keeping close in line [???] following
attentively every move that [???] made . the fens grew more wet [???] opening
into wide [???] meres [???] among which it grew more and more difficult to
find the firmer places where feet could tread without sinking into [???]
mud . the travellers were light [???] or maybe none of them would ever have found
a way through .
presently it grew altogether dark : the air itself seemed black and
heavy to breathe . when lights appeared sam rubbed his eyes : he thought his
head was going queer . he first saw one with the corner of his left eye [???] a
wisp of pale sheen that faded away ; but others appeared soon after : some
like dimly shining smoke [???] some like misty flames [???] slowly above
unseen candles ; here and there they twisted like ghostly sheets [???] by
hidden hands . but neither of his companions spoke a word .
at last sam could bear it no longer . ` what ' s all this [???] [???] ? ' he
said in a whisper . ` these lights ? they ' re all round us now . are we trapped ?
who are they ? '
[???] looked up . a dark water was before him [???] and he was [???] on
the ground [???] this way and that [???] doubtful of the way . ' yes [???] they are all round
us [???] ' he whispered . ' the tricksy lights . candles of corpses [???] yes [???] yes . don ' t
you heed them ! don ' t look ! don ' t follow them ! where ' s the master ? '
sam looked back and found that [???] had lagged again . he could not see

him . he went some paces back into the darkness [???] not daring to move far [???] or
to call in more than a hoarse whisper . suddenly he [???] against [???] [???]
who was standing lost in thought [???] looking at the pale lights . his hands hung
stiff at his sides ; water and slime were dripping from them .
` come [???] mr . [???] ! ' said sam . ' don ' t look at them ! [???] says we
mustn ' t . let ' s keep up with him and get out of this cursed place as quick as
we can - - if we can ! '
` all right [???] ' said [???] [???] as if returning out of a dream . ' i ' m coming .
go on ! '
hurrying forward again [???] sam tripped [???] catching his foot in some old root
or [???] . he fell and came heavily on his hands [???] which sank deep into
sticky ooze [???] so that his fa ce was brought close to the surface of the dark
mere . there was a faint hiss [???] a noisome smell went up [???] the lights [???]
and danced and [???] . for a moment the water below him looked like some
window [???] [???] with grimy glass [???] through which he was peering . wrenching
his
hands out of the bog [???] he sprang back with a cry . ' there are dead things [???]
dead faces in the water [???] ' he said with horror . ' dead faces ! '
[???] laughed . ' the dead marshes [???] yes [???] yes : that is their names [???] ' he
[???] . ` you should not look in when the candles are lit . '
` who are they ? what are they ? ' asked sam [???] [???] turning to [???] [???]
who was now behind him .
' i don ' t know [???] ' said [???] in a dreamlike voice . ' but i have seen them
too . in the [???] when the candles were lit . they lie in all the [???] [???] pale
faces [???] deep deep under the dark water . i saw them : grim faces and evil [???] and
noble faces and sad . many faces proud and fair [???] and weeds in their silver
hair . but all foul [???] all rotting [???] all dead . a fell light is in them . ' [???]
hid his eyes in his hands . ' i know not who they are ; but i thought i saw
there men and elves [???] and [???] beside them . '
` yes [???] yes [???] ' said [???] . ` all dead [???] all rotten . elves and men and [???] .
the dead marshes . there was a great battle long ago [???] yes [???] so they told him
when [???] was young [???] when i was young before the precious came . it was
a
great battle . tall men with long swords [???] and terrible elves [???] and [???]
shrieking . they fought on the plain for days and months at the black gates .
but the marshes have grown since then [???] swallowed up the graves ; always
creeping [???] creeping . '

' but that is an age and more ago [???] ' said sam . ' the dead can ' t be really
there ! is it some devilry hatched in the dark land ? '
` who knows ? [???] doesn ' t know [???] ' answered [???] . ' you cannot reach
them [???] you cannot touch them . we tried once [???] . yes [???] precious . i tried once ;
but you cannot reach them . only shapes to see [???] perhaps [???] not to touch . no
precious ! all dead . '
sam looked darkly at him and [???] again [???] thinking that he guessed
why [???] had tried to touch them . ` well [???] i don ' t want to see them [???] ' he
said . ' never again ! can ' t we get on and get away ? '
` yes [???] yes [???] ' said [???] . ` but slowly [???] very slowly . very carefully ! or
[???] go down to join the dead ones and light little candles . follow
[???] ! don ' t look at lights ! '
he [???] away to the right [???] seeking for a path round the mere . they
came close behind [???] stooping [???] often using their hands even as he did . ' three
precious little [???] in a row we shall be [???] if this goes on much longer [???] '
thought sam .
at last they came to the end of the black mere [???] and they crossed it [???]
perilously [???] [???] or hopping from one treacherous island [???] to
another . often they [???] [???] stepping or falling hands - first into waters
as noisome as a [???] [???] till they were slimed and fouled almost up to
their necks and stank in one another ' s [???] .
it was late in the night when at length they reached firmer ground
again . [???] [???] and whispered to himself [???] but it appeared that he was
pleased : in some mysterious way [???] by some blended sense of feel [???] and smell [???]
and uncanny memory for shapes in the dark [???] he seemed to know just where he
was again [???] and to be sure of his road ahead .
` now on we go ! ' he said . ' nice [???] ! brave [???] ! very very
weary [???] of course ; so we are [???] my precious [???] all of us . but we must take master
away from the wicked lights [???] yes [???] yes [???] we must . ' with these words he started
off again [???] almost at a trot [???] down what appeared to be a long lane between
high reeds [???] and they [???] after him as quickly as they could . but in a
little while he stopped suddenly and [???] the air doubtfully [???] hissing as
if he was troubled or displeased again .
' what is it ? ' growled sam [???] [???] the signs . ` what ' s the need
to sniff ? the stink nearly knocks me down with my nose held . you stink [???] and
master [???] ; the whole place [???] . '
' yes [???] yes [???] and sam [???] ! ' answered [???] . ` poor [???] smells it [???]

but good [???] bears it . helps nice master . but that ' s no matter . the
air ' s moving [???] change is coming . [???] wonders ; he ' s not happy . '
he went on again [???] but his [???] grew [???] and every now and again he
stood up to his full height [???] craning his neck eastward and southward . for
some time the [???] could not hear or feel what was troubling him . then
suddenly all three halted [???] stiffening and listening . to [???] and sam it
seemed that they heard [???] far away [???] a long wailing cry [???] high and thin and
cruel . they shivered . at the same moment the stirring of the air became
[???] to them ; and it grew very cold . as they stood straining their
ears [???] they heard a noise like a wind coming in the distance . the misty
lights wavered [???] dimmed [???] and went out .
[???] would not move . he stood shaking and [???] to himself [???] until
with a rush the wind came upon them [???] hissing and [???] over the marshes .
the night became less dark [???] light enough for them to see [???] or half see [???]
shapeless drifts of fog [???] curling and twisting as it rolled over them and
passed them . looking up they saw the clouds breaking and [???] ; and then
high in the south the moon [???] out [???] riding in the flying wrack .
for a moment the sight of it [???] the hearts of the [???] ; but
[???] cowered down [???] muttering curses on the white face . then [???] and
sam
staring at the sky [???] breathing deeply of the fresher air [???] saw it come : a
small cloud flying from the accursed hills ; a black shadow loosed from
[???] ; a vast shape winged and [???] . it [???] across the moon [???] and
with a deadly cry went away westward [???] outrunning the wind in its fell speed .
they fell forward [???] grovelling [???] on the cold earth . but the
shadow of horror wheeled and returned [???] passing lower now [???] right above them [???]
sweeping the fen - reek with its ghastly wings . and then it was gone [???] flying
back to [???] with the speed of the wrath of [???] ; and behind it the wind
roared away [???] leaving the dead marshes bare and bleak . the naked waste [???] as
far as the eye could pierce [???] even to the distant menace of the mountains [???]
was [???] with the fitful moonlight .
[???] and sam got up [???] rubbing their eyes [???] like children wakened from an
evil dream to find the familiar night still over the world . but [???] lay
on the ground as if he had been [???] . they roused him with difficulty [???]
and for some time he would not lift his face [???] but knelt forward on his
elbows [???] covering the back of his head with his large flat hands .
` [???] ! ' he wailed . ` [???] on wings ! the precious is their master .

they see everything [???] everything . nothing can hide from them . curse the white
face ! and they tell h im everything . he sees [???] he knows . ach [???] [???] [???] [???] [???]
[???] ! ' it was not until the moon had sunk [???] westering far beyond tol
brandir [???] that he would get up or make a move .
from that time on sam thought that he sensed a change in [???] again .
he was more fawning and would - be friendly ; but sam surprised some strange
looks in his eyes at times [???] especially towards [???] ; and he went back more
and more into his old manner of speaking . and sam had another growing
anxiety . [???] seemed to be weary [???] weary to the point of exhaustion . he said
nothing . indeed he hardly spoke at all ; and he did not complain [???] but he
walked like one who carries a load [???] the weight of which is ever increasing ;
and he dragged along [???] slower and slower [???] so that sam had often to beg [???]
to wait and not to leave their master behind .
in fact with every step towards the gates of [???] [???] felt the ring
on its chain about his neck grow more burdensome . he was now beginning to
feel it as an actual weight dragging him earthwards . but far more he was
troubled by the eye : so he called it to himself . it was that more than the
drag of the ring that made him cower and stoop as he walked . the eye : that
horrible growing sense of a hostile will that strove with great power to
pierce all shadows of cloud [???] and earth [???] and flesh [???] and to see you : to pin
you under its deadly gaze [???] naked [???] [???] . so thin [???] so frail and thin [???] the
veils were become that still warded it off . [???] knew just where the
present habitation and heart of that will now was : as certainly as a man can
tell the direction of the sun with his eyes shut . he was facing it [???] and its
potency beat upon his brow .
[???] probably felt something of the same sort . but what went on in
his wretched heart between the pressure of the eye [???] and the lust of the ring
that was so near [???] and his grovelling promise made half in the fear of cold
iron [???] the [???] did not guess : [???] gave no thought to it . sam ' s mind was
occupied mostly with his master hardly noticing the dark cloud that had
fallen on his own heart . he put [???] in front of him now [???] and kept a
watchful eye on every movement of his [???] supporting him if he [???] [???] and
trying to encourage him with [???] words .
when day came at last the [???] were surprised to see how much closer
the [???] mountains had already drawn . the air was now clearer and colder [???]
and though still far off [???] the walls of [???] were no longer a cloudy menace
on the edge of sight [???] but as gr im black towers they frowned across a dismal

waste . the marshes were at an end [???] dying away into dead peats and wide flats
of dry cracked mud . the land ahead rose in long shallow [???] [???] barren and
pitiless [???] towards the desert that lay at [???] ' s gate .
while the grey light lasted [???] they cowered under a black stone like
worms [???] shrinking [???] lest the winged terror should pass and spy them with its
cruel eyes . the remainder of that journey was a shadow of growing fear in
which memory could find nothing to rest upon . for two more nights they
struggled on through the weary pathless land . the air [???] as it seemed to them [???]
grew harsh [???] and filled with a bitter reek that caught their breath and
parched their mouths .
at last [???] on the fifth morning since they took the road with [???] [???]
they halted once more . before them dark in the dawn the great mountains
reached up to roofs of smoke and cloud . out from their feet were flung huge
[???] and broken hills that were now at the nearest scarce a dozen
miles away . [???] looked round in horror . dreadful as the dead marshes had
been [???] and the arid moors of the noman - lands [???] more loathsome far was the
country that the [???] day now slowly [???] to his shrinking eyes .
even to the mere of dead faces some [???] [???] of green spring
would
come ; but here neither spring nor summer would ever come again . here
nothing
lived [???] not even the [???] growths that feed on rottenness . the gasping
[???] were choked with ash and [???] muds [???] sickly white and grey [???] as if
the mountains had [???] the filth of their entrails upon the lands about .
high mounds of crushed and powdered rock [???] great cones of earth fire - blasted
and poison - stained [???] stood like an obscene graveyard in endless rows [???] slowly
revealed in the [???] light .
they had come to the desolation that lay before [???] : the lasting
monument to the dark labour of its slaves that should endure when all their
purposes were made void ; a land defiled [???] diseased beyond all healing - -
unless the great sea should enter in and wash it with oblivion . ` i feel
sick [???] ' said sam . [???] did not speak .
for a while they stood there [???] like men on the edge of a sleep where
[???] lurks [???] holding it off [???] though they know that they can only come to
morning through the shadows . the light broadened and hardened . the
gasping
pits and poisonous mounds grew hideously clear . the sun was up [???] walking

among clouds and long flags of smoke [???] but even the sunlight was defiled . the
[???] had no welcome for that light ; [???] it seemed [???] revealing them
in their helplessness - - little squeaking ghosts that wandered among the
ash - heaps of the dark lord .
too weary to go further they sought for some place where they could
rest . for a while they sat without speaking under the shadow of a mound of
slag ; but foul fumes leaked out of it [???] catching their throats and choking
them . [???] was the first to get up . [???] and cursing he rose [???] and
without a word or a glance at the [???] he [???] away on all fours .
[???] and sam [???] after him [???] until they came to a wide almost circular
pit [???] high - banked upon the west . it was cold and dead [???] and a foul sump of
oily many - coloured ooze lay at its bottom . in this evil hole they cowered [???]
hoping in its shadow to escape the attention of the eye .
the day passed slowly . a great thirst troubled them [???] but they drank
only a few drops from their bottles - last filled in the gully [???] which now as
they looked back in thought seemed to them a place of peace and beauty . the
[???] took it in turn to watch . at first [???] tired as they were [???] neither of
them could sleep at all ; but as the sun far away was climbing down into slow
moving cloud [???] sam dozed . it was [???] ' s turn to bc on guard . he lay back on
the slope of the pit [???] but that did not ease the sense of burden that was on
him . he looked up at the smoke - streaked sky and saw strange [???] [???] dark
riding shapes [???] and faces out of the past . he lost count of time [???] hovering
between sleep and waking [???] until forgetfulness came over him .
suddenly sam woke up thinking that he heard his master calling . it was
evening . [???] could not have called [???] for he had fallen asleep [???] and had slid
down nearly to the bottom of the pit . [???] was by him . for a moment sam
thought that he was trying to rouse [???] ; then he saw that it was not so .
[???] was talking to himself . [???] was holding a debate with some other
thought that used the same voice but made it squeak and hiss . a pale light
and a green light [???] in his eyes as he spoke .
` [???] promised [???] ' said the first thought .
` yes [???] yes [???] my precious [???] ' came the answer [???] ' we promised : to save our
precious [???] not to let him have it - - never . but it ' s going to him yes [???] nearer
every step . what ' s the hobbit going to do with it [???] we wonders [???] yes we
wonders . '
` i don ' t know . i can ' t help it . master ' s got it . [???] promised to
help the master . '

` yes [???] yes [???] to help the master : the master of the precious . but if we
was master [???] then we could help ourselfs [???] yes [???] and still keep promises . '
` but [???] said he would be very very good . nice hobbit ! he took
cruel rope off [???] ' s leg . he speaks nicely to me . '
' very very good [???] eh [???] my precious ? let ' s be good [???] good as fish [???] sweet
one [???] but to ourselfs . not hurt the nice hobbit [???] of course [???] no [???] no . '
` but the precious holds the promise [???] ' the voice of [???] objected .
` then take it [???] ' said the other [???] ` and let ' s hold it ourselfs ! then we
shall be master [???] [???] ! make the other hobbit [???] the [???] suspicious hobbit [???]
make him [???] [???] yes [???] [???] ! '
` but not the nice hobbit ? '
` oh no [???] not if it doesn ' t please us . still he ' s a [???] [???] my precious [???]
yes [???] a [???] . a [???] stole it . he found it and he said nothing [???]
nothing . we hates [???] . '
' no [???] not this [???] . '
' yes [???] every [???] . all peoples that keep the precious . we must have
it ! '
` but he ' ll see [???] he ' ll know . he ' ll take it from us ! '
' he sees . he knows . he heard us make silly promises - - against his
orders [???] yes . must take it . the [???] are searching . must take it . '
' not for him ! '
' no [???] sweet one . see [???] my precious : if we has it [???] then we can escape [???]
even from him [???] eh ? perhaps we grows very strong [???] stronger than [???] . lord
[???] ? [???] the great ? the [???] ! eat fish every day [???] three times a
day ; fresh from the sea . most precious [???] ! must have it . we wants it [???] we
wants it [???] we wants it ! '
' but there ' s two of them . they ' ll wake too quick and kill us [???] ' whined
[???] in a last effort . ` not now . not yet . '
' we wants it ! but ' - - and here there was a long pause [???] as if a new
thought had wakened . ` not yet [???] eh ? perhaps not . she might help . she might [???]
yes . '
` no [???] no ! not that way ! ' wailed [???] .
` yes ! we wants it ! we wants it ! '
each time that the second thought spoke [???] [???] ' s long hand crept out
slowly [???] [???] towards [???] [???] and then was drawn back with a jerk as
[???]
spoke again . finally both arms [???] with long fingers [???] and [???] [???]

[???] towards his neck .
sam had lain still [???] [???] by this debate [???] but watching every move
that [???] made from under his half - closed eye - lids . to his simple mind
ordinary hunger [???] the desire to eat [???] [???] had seemed the chief danger in
[???] . he realized now that it was not so : [???] was feeling the terrible
call of the ring . the dark lord was he [???] of course ; but sam wondered who
she
was . one of the [???] friends the little wretch had made in his wanderings [???]
he supposed . then he forgot the point [???] for things had plainly gone far
enough [???] and were getting dangerous . a great heaviness was in all his limbs [???]
but he roused himself with an effort and sat up . something warned him to be
careful and not to reveal that he had overheard the debate . he let out a
loud sigh and gave a huge yawn .
` what ' s the time ? ' he said sleepily .
[???] sent out a long hiss through his teeth . he stood up for a
moment [???] tense and [???] ; and then he [???] [???] falling forward on to all
fours and [???] up the bank of the pit . ' nice [???] ! nice sam ! ' he
said . ' sleepy heads [???] yes [???] sleepy heads ! leave good [???] to watch ! but
it ' s evening . [???] is creeping . time to go . '
` high time ! ' thought sam . ' and time we parted [???] too . ' yet it crossed
his mind to wonder if indeed [???] was not now as dangerous turned loose as
kept with them . ' curse him ! i wish he was choked ! ' he muttered . he [???]
down the bank and roused his master .
strangely enough [???] [???] felt refreshed . he had been dreaming . the dark
shadow had passed [???] and a fair vision had visited him in this land of
disease . nothing remained of it in his memory [???] yet because of it he felt
glad and lighter of heart . his burden was less heavy on him . [???] welcomed
him with dog - like delight . he [???] and chattered [???] cracking his long
fingers [???] and [???] at [???] ' s knees . [???] smiled at him .
' come ! ' he said . ` you have guided us well and faithfully . this is the
last stage . bring us to the gate [???] and then i will not ask you to go further .
bring us to the gate [???] and you may go where you wish - - only not to our
enemies . '
' to the gate [???] eh ? ' [???] squeaked [???] seeming surprised and frightened .
' to the gate [???] master says ! yes [???] he says so . and good [???] does what he
asks [???] o yes . but when we gets closer [???] we ' ll see perhaps we ' ll see then . it
won ' t look nice at all . o no ! o no ! '

' go on with you ! ' said sam . ` let ' s get it over ! '
in the falling [???] they [???] out of the pit and slowly threaded
their way through the dead land . they had not gone far before they felt once
more the fear that had fallen on them when the winged shape swept over the
marshes . they halted [???] cowering on the evil - smelling ground ; but they saw
nothing in the gloomy evening sky above [???] and soon the menace passed [???] high
overhead [???] going maybe on some swift errand from barad - dyr . after a while
[???] got up and crept forward again [???] muttering and shaking .
about an hour after midnight the fear fell on them a third time [???] but it
now seemed more remote [???] as if it were passing far above the clouds [???] rushing
with terrible speed into the west . [???] [???] however [???] was helpless with
terror [???] and was convinced that they were being hunted [???] that their approach
was known .
` three times ! ' he [???] . ' three times is a threat . they feel us
here [???] they feel the precious . the precious is their master . we cannot go any
further this way [???] no . it ' s no use [???] no use ! '
pleading and kind words were no longer of any avail . it was not until
[???] commanded him angrily and laid a hand on his sword - hilt that [???]
would get up again . then at last he rose with a [???] [???] and went before them
like a beaten dog .
so they [???] on through the weary end of the night [???] and until the
coming of another day of fear they walked in silence with bowed heads [???]
seeing nothing [???] and hearing nothing but the wind hissing in their ears .




chapter 3 . the black gate is closed



before the next day [???] their journey to [???] was over . the
marshes and the desert were behind them . before them [???] darkling against a
[???] sky [???] the great mountains reared their threatening heads .
upon the west of [???] marched the gloomy range of [???] d [???] ath [???] the
mountains of shadow [???] and upon the north the broken peaks and barren ridges
of ered [???] [???] grey as ash . but as these ranges approached one another [???]
being indeed but parts of one great wall about the mournful plains of
[???] and of [???] [???] and the bitter inland sea of n [???] [???] [???] [???] they
swung out long arms northward ; and between these arms there was a deep
defile . this was [???] [???] [???] the haunted pass [???] the entrance to the land
of the enemy . high cliffs lowered upon either side [???] and thrust forward from
its mouth were two sheer hills [???] black - boned and bare . upon them stood the
teeth of [???] [???] two towers strong and tall . in days long past they were
built by the men of [???] in their pride and power [???] after the overthrow of
[???] and his flight [???] lest he should seek to return to his old realm . but
the strength of [???] failed [???] and men slept [???] and for long years the towers
stood empty . then [???] returned . now the watch - towers [???] which had fallen
into decay [???] were repaired [???] and filled with arms [???] and [???] with
ceaseless [???] . stony - faced they were [???] with dark window - holes staring
north and east and west [???] and each window was full of sleepless eyes .
across the mouth of the pass [???] from cliff to cliff [???] the dark lord had
built a rampart of stone . in it there was a single gate of iron [???] and upon
its battlement [???] paced [???] . beneath the hills on either side
the rock was bored into a hundred caves and [???] - holes : there a host of
[???] lurked [???] ready at a signal to issue forth like black ants going to war .
none could pass the teeth of [???] and not feel their bite [???] unless they
were summoned by [???] [???] or knew the secret [???] that would open
the
[???] [???] the black gate of his land .
the two [???] gazed at the towers and the wall in despair . even from
a distance they could see in the dim light the movement of the black guards
upon the wall [???] and the patrols before the gate . they lay now peering over
the edge of a rocky hollow beneath the out - stretched shadow of the northmost

buttress of [???] d [???] ath . winging the heavy air in a straight flight a crow [???]
maybe [???] would have flown but a furlong from their hiding - place to the black
summit of the nearer tower . a faint smoke curled above it [???] as if fire
[???] in the hill beneath .
day came [???] and the fallow sun [???] over the lifeless ridges of ered
[???] . then su [???] the cry of brazen - throated trumpets was heard : from
the watch - towers they blared [???] and far away from hidden holds and [???] in
the hills came answering calls ; and further still [???] remote but deep and
[???] [???] there echoed in the hollow land beyond the mighty horns and drums
of barad - dyr . another dreadful day of fear and toil had come to [???] ; and
the night - guards were summoned to their dungeons and deep halls [???] and the
day - guards [???] evil - eyed and fell [???] were marching to their posts . steel gleamed
dimly on the battlement .
` well [???] here we are ! ' said sam . ` here ' s the gate [???] and it looks to me as
if that ' s about as far as we are ever going to get . my word [???] but the [???]
would have a thing or two to say [???] if he saw me now ! often said i ' d come to a
bad end [???] if i didn ' t watch my step [???] he did . but now i don ' t suppose i ' ll
ever see the old fellow again . he ' ll miss his chance of i told ' ee so [???] sam :
more ' s the pity . he could go on telling me as long as he ' d got breath [???] if
only i could see his old face again . but i ' d have to get a wash first [???] or he
wouldn ' t know me .
` i suppose it ' s no good asking [???] what way do we go now ? [???] we can ' t go no
further - unless we want to ask the [???] for a lift . '
` no [???] no ! ' said [???] . ` no use . we can ' t go further . [???] said so .
he said : we ' ll go to the gate [???] and then we ' ll see . and we do see . o yes . my
precious [???] we do see . [???] knew [???] could not go this way . o yes .
[???] knew '
' then what the plague did you bring us here for ? ' said sam [???] not
feeling in the mood to be just or reasonable .
` master said so . master says : bring us to the gate . so good [???]
does so . master said so [???] wise master . '
' i did [???] ' said [???] . his face was grim and set . but resolute . he was
filthy [???] [???] [???] and pinched with weariness [???] but he cowered no longer [???] and
his eyes were clear . ` i said so [???] because i purpose to enter [???] [???] and i
know no other way . therefore i shall go this way . i do not ask anyone to go
with me . '
` no [???] no [???] master ! ' wailed [???] ; [???] at him [???] and seeming in great

distress . ` no use that way ! no use ! don ' t take the precious to him ! he ' ll
eat us all [???] if he gets it [???] eat all the world . keep it [???] nice master [???] and be
kind to [???] . don ' t let him have it . or go away . go to nice places [???] and
give it back to little [???] . yes [???] yes [???] master : give it back [???] eh ? [???]
will keep it safe ; he will do lots of good [???] especially to nice [???] .
[???] go home . don ' t go to the gate ! '
' i am commanded to go to the land of [???] [???] and therefore i shall go [???] '
said [???] . ' if there is only one way [???] then i must take it . what comes after
must come . '
sam said nothing . the look on [???] ' s face was enough for him he knew
that words of his were useless . and after all he never had any real hope in
the affair from the beginning ; but being a cheerful hobbit he had not needed
hope [???] as long as despair could be [???] . now they were come to the
bitter end . but he had stuck to his master all the way ; that was what he had
chiefly come for [???] and he would still stick to him . his master would not go
to [???] alone . sam would go with him - and at any rate they would get rid of
[???] .
[???] [???] however [???] did not intend to be got rid of [???] yet . he knelt a t
[???] ' s feet [???] wringing his hands and squeaking . ' not this way [???] master ! ' he
pleaded [???] ' there is another way . o yes indeed there is . another way . darker [???]
more difficult to find [???] more secret . but [???] knows it . let [???] show
you ! '
' another wa y ! ' said [???] doubtfully [???] looking down at [???] with
searching eyes .
' yess ! yess indeed ! there was another way . [???] found it . let ' s go
and see if it ' s still there ! '
` you have not spoken of this before . '
` no . master did not ask . master did not say what he meant to do . he
does not tell poor [???] . he says : [???] [???] take me to the gate - - and
then good bye ! [???] can run away and be good . but now he says : i purpose
to enter [???] this way . so [???] is very afraid . he does not want to
lose nice master . and he promised [???] master made him promise [???] to save the
precious . but master is going to take it to him [???] straight to the black hand [???]
if master will go this way . so [???] must save them both [???] and he thinks of
another way that there was [???] once upon a time . nice master . [???] very
good [???] always helps . '
sam frowned . if he could have bored holes in [???] with his eyes [???] he

would have done . his mind was full of doubt . to all appearances [???] was
[???] distressed and anxious to help [???] . but sam [???] remembering the
overheard debate [???] found it hard to believe that the long [???] [???]
had come out on top : that voice at any rate had not had the last word in the
debate . sam ' s guess was that the [???] and [???] halves ( or what in his
own mind he called [???] and [???] ) had made a truce and a temporary
alliance : neither wanted the enemy to get the ring ; both wished to keep
[???] from capture [???] and under their eye [???] as long as possible - - at any rate
as long as [???] still had a chance of laying hands on his ' precious ' .
whether there really was another way into [???] sam doubted .
` and it ' s a good thing neither half of the old villain don ' t know what
master means to do [???] ' he thought . ` if he knew that mr . [???] is trying to put
an end to his precious for good and all [???] there ' d be trouble pretty quick [???] i
bet . anyhow old [???] is so frightened of the enemy - - and he ' s under
orders of some kind from him [???] or was - - that he ' d give us away rather than
be caught helping us ; and rather than let his precious be melted [???] maybe . at
least that ' s my idea . and i hope the master will think it out carefully .
he ' s as wise as any [???] but he ' s soft - hearted [???] that ' s what he is . it ' s beyond
any [???] to guess what he ' ll do next . '
[???] did not answer [???] at once . while these doubts were passing
through sam ' s slow but shrewd mind [???] he stood gazing out towards the dark
cliff of [???] [???] . the hollow in which they had taken [???] was delved
in the side of a low hill [???] at some little height above a long trenchlike
valley that lay between it and the outer [???] of the mountains . in the
midst of the valley stood the black foundations of the western watch - tower .
by morning - light the roads that [???] upon the gate of [???] could
now
be clearly seen [???] pale and dusty ; one winding back northwards ; another
[???] eastwards into the mists that clung about the feet of ered [???] ;
and a third that ran towards him . as it bent sharply round the tower [???] it
entered a narrow defile and passed not far below the hollow where he stood .
westward [???] to his right [???] it turned [???] [???] the shoulders of the mountains [???]
and went off southwards into the deep shadows that mantled all the western
sides of [???] d [???] ath ; beyond his sight it journeyed on into the narrow land
between the mountains and the great river .
as he gazed [???] became aware that there was a great stir and movement
on the plain . it seemed as if whole armies were on the march [???] though for the

most part they were hidden by the reeks and fumes drifting from the fens and
wastes beyond . but here and there he caught the gleam of spears and helmets ;
and over the levels beside the roads horsemen could be seen riding in many
companies . he remembered his vision from afar upon amon hen [???] so few
days
before [???] though now it seemed many years ago . then he knew that the hope that
had for one wild moment stirred in his heart was vain . the trumpets had not
rung in challenge but in greeting . this was no assault upon the dark lord by
the men of [???] [???] risen like avenging ghosts from the graves of valour long
passed away . these were men of other race [???] out of the wide [???] [???]
gathering to the summons of their overlord ; armies that had [???] before
his gate by night and now marched in to swell his mounting power . as if
suddenly made fully aware of the peril of their position [???] alone [???] in the
growing light of day [???] so near to this vast menace [???] [???] quickly drew his
frail grey hood close upon his head [???] and stepped down into the dell . then he
turned to [???] .
` [???] [???] ' he said [???] ` i will trust you once more . [???] it seems that i
must do so [???] and that it is my fate to receive help from you . where i least
looked for it [???] and your fate to help me whom you long pursued with evil
purpose . so far you have deserved well of me and have kept your promise
truly . truly [???] i say and mean [???] ' he added with a glance at sam [???] ' for twice now
we have been in your power [???] and you have done no harm to us . nor have you
tried to take from me what you once sought . may the third time prove the
best ! but i warn you [???] [???] [???] you are in danger . '
` yes [???] yes [???] master ! ' said [???] . ` dreadful danger ! [???] ' s bones
shake to think of it . but he doesn ' t run away . he must help nice master . '
' i did not mean the danger that we all share [???] ' said [???] . ' i mean a
danger to yourself alone . you swore a promise by what you call the precious .
remember tha t ! it will hold you to it ; but it will seek a way to twist it to
your own undoing . already you are being twisted . you revealed yourself to me
just now [???] foolishly . give it back to [???] you said . do not say that
again ! do not let that thought grow in you ! you will never get it back . but
the desire of it may betray you to a bitter end . you will never get it back .
in the last need [???] [???] [???] i should put on the precious ; and the precious
mastered you long ago . if i [???] wearing it [???] were to command you [???] you would
obey [???] even if it were to leap from a [???] or to cast yourself into the
fire . and such would be my command . so have a care [???] [???] ! '

sam looked at his master with approval [???] but also with surprise : there
was a look in his face and a tone in his voice that he had not known before .
it had always been a notion of his that the kindness of dear mr . [???] was
of such a high degree that it must imply a fair measure of blindness . of
course [???] he also firmly held the [???] belief that mr . [???] was the
wisest person in the world ( with the possible exception of old mr . [???] and
of [???] ) . [???] in his own way [???] and with much more excuse as his
acquaintance was much briefer [???] may have _ made a similar mistake [???] [???]
kindness and blindness . at any rate this speech [???] and terrified him .
he grovelled on the ground and could speak no clear words but nice master .
[???] waited patiently for a while [???] then he spoke again less sternly .
` come now [???] [???] or [???] if you wish [???] tell me of this other way [???] and
show me [???] if you can [???] what hope there is in it [???] enough to justify me in
turning aside from my plain path . i am in haste . '
but [???] was in a pitiable state [???] and [???] ' s threat had quite
[???] him . it was not easy to get any clear account out of him [???] amid his
[???] and [???] [???] and the frequent interruptions in which he [???]
on the floor and begged them both to be kind to ` poor little [???] ' . after
a while he grew a little calmer [???] and [???] gathered bit by bit that [???] if a
traveller followed the road that turned west of [???] d [???] ath [???] he would come
in time to a crossing in a circle of dark trees . on the right a road went
down to [???] and the bridges of the [???] ; in the middle the road went
on southwards .
` on [???] on [???] on [???] ' said [???] . ` we never went that way [???] but they say it
goes a hundred leagues [???] until you can see the great water that is never
still . there are lots of fishes there [???] and big birds eat fishes : nice birds :
but we never went there [???] alas no ! we never had a chance . and further still
there are more lands [???] they say [???] but the yellow face is very hot there [???] and
there are seldom any clouds [???] and the men are fierce and have dark faces . we
do not want to see that land . '
` no ! ' said [???] . ` but do not wander from your road . what of the third
turning ? '
` o yes [???] o yes [???] there is a third way [???] ' said [???] . ` that is the road to
the left . at once it begins to climb up [???] up [???] winding and climbing back
towards the tall shadows . when it turns round the black rock [???] you ' ll see it .
suddenly you ' ll see it above you [???] and you ' ll want to hide . '
` see it [???] see it ? what will you see ? '

` the old fortress [???] very old [???] very horrible now . we used to hear tales
from the south [???] when [???] was young [???] long ago . o yes . we used to tell
lots of tales in the evening [???] sitting by the banks of the great river [???] in
the willow - lands [???] when the river was younger too [???] [???] [???] [???] . ' he began
to weep and mutter . the [???] waited patiently .
` tales out of the south [???] ' [???] went on again [???] ` about the tall men
with the shining eyes [???] and their houses like hills of stone [???] and the silver
crown of their king and his white tree : wonderful tales . they built very
tall towers [???] and one they raised was silver - white [???] and in it there was a
stone like the moon [???] and round it were great white walls . o yes [???] there were
many tales about the tower of the moon . '
` that would be minas [???] that [???] the son of [???] built ' said
[???] . ` it was [???] who cut off the finger of the enemy . '
` yes [???] he has only four on the black hand [???] but they are enough [???] ' said
[???] [???] . ' and he hated [???] ' s city . '
' what does he not hate ? ' said [???] . ' but what has the tower of the
moon to do with us ? '
' well [???] master [???] there it was and there it is : the tall tower and the
white houses and the wall ; but not nice now [???] not beautiful . he conquered it
long ago . it is a very terrible place now . travellers shiver when they see
it [???] they creep out of sight [???] they avoid its shadow . but master will have to
go that way . that is the only other way [???] for the mountains are lower there [???]
and the old road goes up and up [???] until it reaches a dark pass at the top [???]
and then it goes down [???] down [???] again - - to [???] . ' his voice sank to a
whisper and he [???] .
` but how will that help us ? ' asked sam . ` surely the enemy knows all
about his own mountains [???] and that road will be guarded as close as th is ? the
tower isn ' t empty [???] is it ? '
` o no [???] not empty ! ' whispered [???] . ` it seems empty [???] but it isn ' t [???] o
no ! very dreadful things live there . [???] . yes always [???] ; but worse
things [???] worse things live there too . the road climbs right under the shadow
of the walls and passes the gate . nothing moves on the road that they don ' t
know about . the things inside know : the silent watchers . '
` so that ' s your advice is it [???] ' said sam [???] ' that we should go another
long march south [???] to find ourselves in the same fix or a worse one [???] when we
get there [???] if we ever do ? '
` no [???] no indeed [???] ' said [???] . ` [???] must see [???] must try to

understand . he does not expect attack that way . his eye is all round [???] but it
attends more to some places than to others . he can ' t see everything all at
once [???] not yet . you see [???] he has conquered all the country west of the shadowy
mountains down to the river [???] and he holds the bridges now . he thinks no one
can come to the [???] without fighting big battle at the bridges [???] or
getting lots of boats which they cannot hide and he will know about . '
' you seem to know a lot about what he ' s doing and thinking [???] ' said sam .
` have you been talking to him lately ? or just [???] with [???] ? '
' not nice hobbit [???] not sensible [???] ' said [???] [???] giving sam an angry
glance and turning to [???] . ' [???] has talked to [???] [???] yes of course [???]
before he met master [???] and to many peoples : he has walked very far . and what
he says now many peoples are saying . it ' s here in the north that the big
danger is for him [???] and for us . he will come out of the black gate one day [???]
one day soon . that is the only way big armies can come . but away down west
he is not afraid [???] and there are the silent watchers . '
` just so ! ' said sam [???] not to be put off . ` and so we are to walk up and
knock at their gate and ask if we ' re on the right road for [???] ? or are
they too silent to answer ? it ' s not . sense . we might as well do it here [???] and
save ourselves a long tramp . '
' don ' t make jokes about it [???] ' [???] [???] . ` it isn ' t funny [???] o no ! not
[???] . it ' s nut sense to try and get into [???] at all . but if master
says i must go or i will go [???] then he must try some way . but he must not go
to the terrible city [???] o no [???] of course not . that is where [???] helps . nice
[???] . though no one tells him what it is all about . [???] helps again .
he found it . he knows it . '
' what did you find ? ' asked [???] .
[???] [???] down and his voice sank to a whisper again . ' a little
path leading up into the mountains : and then a stair [???] a narrow stair [???] o yes [???]
very long and narrow . and then more stairs . and then ' - - his voice sank even
lower - - ` a tunnel [???] a dark tunnel ; and at last a little cleft [???] and a path
high above the main pass . it was that way that [???] got out of the
darkness . but it was years ago . the path may have vanished now ; but perhaps
not [???] perhaps not . '
` i don ' t like the sound of it at all [???] ' said sam . ` sounds too easy at
any rate in the telling . if that path is still there [???] it ' ll be guarded too .
wasn ' t it guarded [???] [???] ? ' as he said this [???] he caught or fancied he caught
a green gleam in [???] ' s eye . [???] muttered but did not reply .

' is it not guarded ? ' asked [???] sternly . ` and did you escape out of
the darkness [???] [???] ? were you not rather permitted to depart upon an
errand ? that at least is w hat [???] thought [???] who found you by the dead
marshes some years ago . '
' it ' s a lie ! ' [???] [???] [???] and an evil light came into his eyes at
the naming of [???] . ` he lied on me [???] yes he did . i did escape [???] all by my
poor self . indeed i was told to seek for the precious ; and i have searched
and searched [???] of course i have . but not for the black one . the precious was
ours [???] it was mine i tell you . i did escape . '
[???] felt a strange certainty that in this matter [???] was for once
not so far from the truth as might be suspected ; that he had somehow found a
way out of [???] [???] and at least believed that it was by his own cunning . for
one thing [???] he noted that [???] used i [???] and that seemed usually to be a
sign [???] on its rare appearances . that some [???] of old truth and [???]
were for the moment on top . but even if [???] could be trusted on this
point [???] [???] did not forget the wiles of the enemy . the ' escape ' may have
been allowed or arranged [???] and well known in the dark tower . and in any case
[???] was plainly keeping a good deal back .
' i ask you again [???] ' he said : ` is not this secret way guarded ? '
but the name of [???] had put [???] into a sullen mood . he had all
the injured air of a liar suspected when for once he has told the truth . or
part of it . he did not answer .
' is it not guarded ? ' [???] repeated .
` yes [???] yes [???] perhaps . no safe places in this country [???] ' said [???]
[???] . ' no safe places . but master must try it or go home . . no other
way . ' they could not get him to say more . the name of the perilous place and
the high pass he could not tell [???] or would not .
its name was [???] ungol [???] a name of dreadful rumour . [???] could
perhaps have told them that name and its [???] : [???] would have
warned them . but they were alone [???] and [???] was far away [???] and [???]
stood amid the ruin of [???] and strove with [???] [???] delayed by treason .
yet even as he spoke his last words to [???] [???] and the [???] [???] in
fire upon the steps of orthanc . his thought was ever upon [???] and [???] [???]
over the long leagues his mind sought for them in hope and pity .
maybe [???] felt it [???] not knowing it [???] as he had upon amon hen [???] even
though he believed that [???] was gone [???] gone for ever into the shadow in
moria far away . he sat upon the ground for a long while [???] silent [???] his head

bowed [???] striving to recall all that [???] had said to him . but for this
choice he could recall no counsel . indeed [???] ' s [???] had been taken
from them too soon [???] too soon [???] while the dark land was still very far away .
how they should enter it at the last [???] had not said . perhaps he could
not say . into the stronghold of the enemy in the north [???] into dol [???] [???] he
had once ventured . but into [???] [???] to the mountain of fire and to
barad - dyr [???] since the dark lord rose in power again [???] had he ever journeyed
there ? [???] did not think so . and here he was a little halfling from the
shire [???] a simple hobbit of the quiet countryside expected to find a way where
the great ones could not go [???] or dared not go . it was an evil fate . but he
had taken it on himself in his own sitting - room in the far - off spring of
another year [???] so remote now that it was like a chapter in a story of the
world ' s youth [???] when the trees of silver and gold were still in bloom . this
was an evil choice . which way should he choose ? and if both led to terror
and death [???] what good lay in choice ?
the day drew on . a deep silence fell upon the little grey hollow where
they lay [???] so near to the borders of the land of fear : a silence that could
be felt [???] as if it were a thick veil that cut them off from all the world
about them . above them was a dome of pale sky barred with fleeting smoke [???]
but it seemed high and far away . as if seen through great deeps of air heavy
with brooding thought .
not even an eagle poised against the sun would have marked the [???]
sitting there [???] under the weight of doom [???] silent [???] [???] not moving [???] shrouded in
their thin grey cloaks . for a moment he might have paused to consider
[???] [???] a tiny figure [???] on the ground : there perhaps lay the
famished [???] of some child of men [???] its ragged garment still [???] to
it [???] its long arms and legs almost bone - white and bone - thin : no flesh worth a
peck .
[???] ' s head was bowed over his knees [???] but sam leaned back [???] with hands
behind his head [???] staring out of his hood at the empty sky . at least for a
long while it was empty . then presently sam thought he saw a dark bird - like
figure wheel into the circle of his sight [???] and hover [???] and then wheel away
again . two more followed [???] and then a fourth . they were very small to look
at [???] yet he knew [???] somehow [???] that they were huge [???] with a vast stretch of
pinion [???] flying at a great height . he covered his eyes and bent forward [???]
cowering . the same warning fear was on him as he had felt in the presence of
the black riders [???] the helpless horror that had come with the cry in the wind

and the shadow on the moon [???] though now it was not so crushing or compelling :
the menace was more remote . but menace it was . [???] felt it too . his
thought was broken . he stirred and shivered [???] but he did not look up . [???]
[???] himself together like a cornered spider . the winged shapes wheeled [???]
and stooped swiftly down [???] speeding back to [???] .
sam took a deep breath . ` the riders are a bout again [???] up in the air [???] ' he
said in a hoarse whisper . ' i saw them . do you think they could see us ? they
were very high up . and if they are black riders same as before [???] then they
can ' t see much by daylight [???] can they ? '
' no [???] perhaps not [???] ' said [???] . ` but their steeds could see . and these
winged creatures that they ride on now [???] they can probably see more than any
other creature . they are like great carrion birds . they are looking for
something : the enemy is on the watch [???] i fear . '
the feeling of dread passed [???] but the [???] silence was broken . for
some time they had been cut off from the world [???] as if in an invisible
island ; now they were laid bare again [???] peril had returned . but still [???]
did not speak to [???] or make h is choice . his eyes were closed [???] as if he
were dreaming [???] or looking inward into his heart and memory . at last he
stirred and stood up [???] and it seemed that he was about to speak and to
decide . but ` hark ! ' he said . ` what is that ? '
a new fear was upon them . they heard singing and hoarse shouting . at
first it seemed a long way off [???] but it drew nearer : it was coming towards
them . it leaped into all their minds that the black wings had spied them and
had sent armed soldiers to seize them : no speed seemed too great for these
terrible servants of [???] . they [???] [???] listening . the voices and the
clink of weapons and harness were very close . [???] and sam loosened their
small swords in their sheaths . flight was impossible .
[???] rose slowly and [???] insect - like to the lip of the hollow .
very [???] he raised himself inch by inch [???] until he could peer over it
between two broken points of stone . he remained there without moving for
some time [???] making no sound . presen tly the voices began to recede again [???] and
then they slowly faded away . far off a horn blew on the [???] of the
[???] . then quietly [???] drew back and slipped down into the hollow .
' more men going to [???] [???] ' he said in a low voice . ` dark faces . we
have not seen men like these before [???] no [???] [???] has not . they are fierce .
they have black eyes [???] and long black hair [???] and gold rings in their ears ;
yes [???] lots of beautiful gold . and some have red paint on their cheeks [???] and

red cloaks ; and their flags are red [???] and the tips of their spears ; and they
have round shields [???] yellow and black with big [???] . not nice ; very cruel
wicked men they look . almost as bad as [???] [???] and much bigger . [???]
thinks
they have come out of the south beyond the great river ' s end : they came up
that road . they have passed on to the black gate ; but more may follow .
always more people coming to [???] . one day all the peoples will be
inside . '
` were there any [???] ? ' asked sam [???] forgetting his fear in his
eagerness for news of strange places .
` no [???] no [???] . what are [???] ? ' said [???] .
sam stood up [???] putting his hands behind his back ( as he always did when
' speaking poetry ' ) [???] and began :
grey as a mouse [???]
big as a house .
nose like a snake [???]
i make the earth shake [???]
as i tramp through the grass ;
trees crack as i pass .
with horns in my mouth
i walk in the south [???]
flapping big ears .
beyond count of years
i stump round and round [???]
never lie on the ground [???]
not even to die .
[???] am i [???]
[???] of all [???]
huge [???] old [???] and tall .
if ever you ' d met me
you wouldn ' t forget me .
if you never do [???]
you won ' t think i ' m true ;
but old o [???] am i [???]
and i never lie .
' that [???] ' said sam [???] when he had finished reciting [???] ` that ' s a rhyme we
have in the shire . nonsense maybe [???] and maybe not . but we have our tales too [???]

and news out of the south [???] you know . in the old days [???] used to go on
their travels now and again . not that many ever came back [???] and not that all
they said was believed : news from bree [???] and not sure as [???] [???] as the
sayings go . but i ' ve heard tales of the big folk down away in the [???] .
[???] we call ' em in our tales ; and they ride on [???] [???] ' tis said [???]
when they fight . they put houses and towers on the [???] backs and
all [???] and the [???] throw rocks and trees at one another . so when you
said [???] men out of the south [???] all in red and gold ; [???] i said [???] were there any
[???] ? [???] for if there was [???] i was going to take a look [???] risk or no . but
now i don ' t suppose i ' ll ever see an [???] . maybe there ain ' t no such a
beast . ' he sighed .
` no [???] no [???] [???] ' said [???] again . ' [???] has not heard of them .
he does not want to see them . he does not want them to be . [???] wants to
go away from here and hide somewhere safer . [???] wants master to go .
nice
master [???] won ' t he come with [???] ? '
[???] stood up . he had laughed in the midst of all his cares when sam
trotted out the old fireside rhyme of [???] [???] and the laugh had released
him from hesitation . ` i wish we had a thousand [???] with [???] on a
white one at their head [???] ' he said . ` then we ' d break a way into this evil
land [???] perhaps . but we ' ve not ; just our own tired legs [???] that ' s all . well [???]
[???] [???] the third turn may turn the best . i will come with you . '
' good master [???] wise master [???] nice master ! ' cried [???] in delight [???]
patting [???] ' s knees . ` good master ! then rest now [???] nice [???] [???] under the
shadow of the stones [???] close under the stones ! rest and lie quiet [???] till the
yellow face goes away . then we can go quickly . soft and quick as shadows
we
must be ! '

[???] h4 [???] chapter 4 . [???] [???] h4 [???] of herbs and stewed rabbit



for the few hours of daylight that were left they rested [???] shifting into
the shade as the sun moved [???] until at last the shadow of the western rim of
their dell grew long [???] and darkness filled all the hollow . then they ate a
little [???] and drank sparingly . [???] ate nothing [???] but he accepted water
gladly .
` soon get more now [???] ' he said [???] licking his lips . ` good water runs down
in streams to the great river [???] nice water in the lands we are going to .
[???] will get food there too [???] perhaps . he ' s very hungry [???] yes [???] [???] ! ' he
set his two large flat hands on his [???] belly [???] and a pale green light
came into his eyes .
the [???] was deep when at length they set out [???] creeping over the
westward rim of the dell [???] and fading like ghosts into the broken country on
the borders of the road : the moon was now three nights from the full [???] but it
did not climb over the mountains until nearly midnight [???] and the early night
was very dark . a single red light burned high up in the tower s of the teeth [???]
but otherwise no sign could be seen or heard of the sleepless watch on the
[???] .
for many miles the red eye seemed to stare at them as they fled [???]
stumbling through a barren stony country . they did not dare to take the
road [???] but they kept it on their left [???] following its line as well as they
could at a little distance . at last [???] when night was growing old and they
were already weary [???] for they had taken only one short rest [???] the eye [???]
to a small fiery point a nd then vanished : they had turned the dark northern
shoulder of the lower mountains and were heading southwards .
with hearts strangely lightened they now rested again [???] but not for
long . they were not going quick enough for [???] . by his reckoning it was
nearly thirty leagues from the [???] to the cross - roads above [???] [???]
and he hoped to cover that distance in four journeys . so soon they struggled
on once more [???] until the dawn began to spread slowly in the wide grey
solitude . they had then walked almost eight leagues ; and the [???] could
not have gone any further [???] even if they had dared .
the growing light revealed to them a land already [???] less barren and
ruinous . the mountains still loomed up [???] on their left [???] but near at
hand they could see the southward road [???] now bearing away from the black

roots of the hills and [???] westwards . beyond it were [???] covered
with [???] trees like dark clouds . but all about them lay a tumbled
heathland [???] grown with ling and broom and cornel [???] and other [???] that they
did not know . here and there they saw knots of tall pine - trees . the hearts
of the [???] rose again a little in spite of weariness : the air was fresh
and fragrant [???] and it reminded them of the [???] of the [???] far
away . it seemed good to be [???] [???] to walk in a land that had only been
for a few years under the dominion of the dark lord and was not yet fallen
wholly into decay . but they did not forget their danger [???] nor the black gate
that was still all too near [???] hidden though it was behind the gloomy heights .
they looked about for a hiding - place where they could shelter from evil eyes
while the light lasted .
the day passed [???] . they lay deep in the heather and counted out
the slow hours [???] in which there seemed little change ; for they were still
under the shadows of the [???] d [???] ath [???] and the sun was veiled . [???] slept at
times [???] deeply and peacefully [???] either trusting [???] or too tired to trouble
about him ; but sam found it difficult to do more than doze [???] even when [???]
was plainly fast asleep [???] [???] and [???] in his secret dreams .
hunger [???] perhaps [???] more than mistrust kept him wakeful : he had begun to long
for a good homely meal [???] ` something hot out of the pot ' .
as soon as the land faded into a formless grey under coming night [???] they
started out again . in a little while [???] led them down on to the
southward road ; and after that they went on more quickly [???] though the danger
was greater . their ears were strained for the sound of hoof or foot on the
road ahead [???] or following them from behind ; but the night passed [???] and they
heard no sound of walker or rider .
the road had been made in a long lost time : and for perhaps thirty
miles below the [???] it had been newly repaired [???] but as it went south
the wild [???] upon it . the [???] of men of old could still be seen
in its straight sure flight and level course : now and again it cut its way
through hillside [???] [???] or leaped over a stream upon a wide shapely arch of
enduring [???] ; but at last all signs of stonework faded [???] save for a
broken pillar here and there [???] peering out of bushes at the side [???] or old
paving - stones still lurking amid weeds and moss . heather and trees and
[???] [???] down and [???] the banks [???] or [???] out over the
surface . it [???] at last to a country cart - road little used ; but it did
not wind : it held on its own sure course and guided them by the swiftest

way .
so they passed into the northern marches of that land that men once
called [???] [???] a fair country of climbing woods and swift - falling streams .
the night became fine under star and round moon [???] and it seemed to the
[???] that the fragrance of the air grew as they went forward ; and from
the blowing and muttering of [???] it seemed that he noticed it too [???] and
did not relish it . at the first signs of day they halted again . they had
come to the end of a long cutting [???] deep [???] and sheer - sided in the middle [???] by
which the road clove its way through a stony ridge . now they climbed up the
westward bank and looked abroad .
day was opening in the sky [???] and they saw that the mountains were now
much further off [???] receding ea stward in a long curve that was lost in the
distance . before them [???] as they turned west [???] gentle [???] ran down into dim
hazes far below . all about them were small woods of resinous trees [???] fir and
cedar and [???] . and other kinds unknown in the shire [???] with wide glades
among them ; and everywhere there was a wealth of sweet - smelling herbs and
[???] . the long journey from [???] had brought them far south of their
own land [???] but not until now in this more sheltered region had the [???]
felt the change of clime . here spring was already busy about them : [???]
pierced moss and mould [???] larches were green - fingered [???] small flowers were
opening in the turf [???] birds were singing . [???] [???] the garden of [???] now
desolate kept still a [???] dryad loveliness .
south and west it looked towards the warm lower vales of [???] [???]
shielded from the east by the [???] d [???] ath and yet not under the
mountain - shadow [???] protected from the north by the emyn muil [???] open to the
southern airs and the moist winds from the sea far away . many great trees
grew there [???] planted long ago [???] falling into untended age amid a riot of
careless descendants ; and groves and thickets there were of [???] and
[???] [???] [???] of olive and of bay ; and there were [???] and myrtles ;
and [???] that grew in bushes [???] or with their woody creeping stems mantled
in deep [???] the hidden stones ; sages of many kinds putting forth blue
flowers [???] or red [???] or pale green ; and [???] and new - [???] [???] [???]
and many herbs of forms and scents beyond the garden - lore of sam . the grots
and rocky walls were already starred with [???] and [???] .
[???] and [???] were awake in the filbert - brakes ; and [???] and
many lily - flowers nodded their half - opened heads in the grass : deep green
grass beside the [???] [???] where falling streams halted in cool hollows on

their journey down to [???] .
the travellers turned their backs on the road and went [???] . as
they walked [???] brushing their way through bush and herb [???] sweet odours rose
about them . [???] coughed and retched ; but the [???] breathed deep [???] and
suddenly sam laughed [???] for heart ' s ease not for jest . they followed a stream
that went quickly down before them . presently it brought them to a small
clear lake in a shallow dell : it lay in the broken ruins of an ancient stone
basin [???] the carven rim of which was almost wholly covered with mosses and
rose - [???] ; iris - swords stood in ranks about it . and water - lily leaves
floated on its dark gently - [???] surface ; but it was deep and fresh [???] and
spilled ever softly out over a stony lip at the far end .
here they washed themselves and drank their fill at the in - falling
freshet . then they sought for a resting - place [???] and a hiding - place : for this
land [???] fair - seeming still [???] was nonetheless now territory of the enemy . they
had not come very far from the road [???] and yet even in so short a space they
had seen scars of the old wars [???] and the newer wounds made by the [???] and
other foul servants of the dark lord : a pit of uncovered filth and refuse ;
trees hewn down wantonly and left to die [???] with evil runes or the fell sign
of the eye cut in rude strokes on their bark .
sam [???] below the outfall of the lake . smelling and touching the
[???] plants and trees [???] forgetful for the moment of [???] [???] was
reminded suddenly of their ever - present peril . he [???] on a ring still
[???] by fire [???] and in the midst of it he found a pile of charred and
broken bones and skulls . the swift growth of the wild with briar and
[???] and trailing clematis was already drawing a veil over this place
of dreadful feast and slaughter ; but it was not ancient . he hurried back to
his companions [???] but he said nothing : the bones were best left in peace and
not [???] and routed by [???] .
` let ' s find a place to lie up in [???] ' he said . ' not lower down . higher up
for me . '
a little way back above the lake they found a deep brown bed of last
year ' s fern . beyond it was a thicket of dark - leaved bay - trees climbing up a
steep bank that was crowned with old cedars . here they decided to rest and
pass the day [???] which already promised to be bright and warm . a good day for
strolling on their way along the groves and glades of [???] ; but though
[???] may shun the sunlight . there were too many places here where they could
lie hid and watch ; and other evil eyes were abroad : [???] had many

servants . [???] [???] in any case [???] would not move under the yellow . face . soon
it would look over the dark ridges of the [???] d [???] ath [???] and he would faint
and cower in the light and heat .
sam had been giving earnest thought to food as they marched . now that
the despair of the [???] gate was behind him [???] he did not feel so
inclined as his master to take no thought for their livelihood beyond the
end of their errand ; and anyway it seemed wiser to him to save the [???]
of the elves for worse times ahead . six days or more had passed since he
reckoned that they had only a bare supply for three weeks .
' if we reach the fire in that time [???] we ' ll be lucky at this rate ! ' he
thought . ` and we might be wanting to get back . we might ! '
besides [???] at the end of a long night - march [???] and after bathing and
drinking [???] he felt even more hungry than usual . a supper [???] or a breakfast [???] by
the fire in the old kitchen at [???] row was what he really wanted . an
idea struck him and he turned to [???] . [???] had just begun to sneak off
on his own [???] and he was [???] away on all fours through the fern .
` hi ! [???] ! ' said sam . ` where are you going ? hunting ? well see here [???]
old noser [???] you don ' t like our food [???] and i ' d not be sorry for a change
myself . your new motto ' s always ready to help . could you find anything fit
for a hungry hobbit ? '
` yes [???] perhaps [???] yes [???] ' said [???] . ` [???] always helps [???] if they asks
- - if they asks nicely . '
` right ! ' said sam ` i does ask . and if that isn ' t nice enough [???] i begs . '
[???] disappeared . he was away some time [???] and [???] after a few
[???] of [???] settled deep into the brown fern and went to sleep . sam
looked at him . the early daylight was only just creeping down into the
shadows u nder the trees [???] but he saw his master ' s face very clearly [???] and his
hands [???] too [???] lying at rest on the ground beside him . he was reminded suddenly
of [???] as he had lain [???] asleep in the house of [???] [???] after his deadly
wound . then as he had kept watch sam had noticed that at times a light
seemed to be shining faintly within ; but now the light was even clearer and
stronger . [???] ' s face was peaceful [???] the marks of fear and care had left it ;
but it looked old [???] old and beautiful [???] as if the [???] of the shaping
years was now revealed in many fine lines that had before been hidden [???]
though the identity of the face was not changed . not that sam [???] put it
that way to himself . he shook his head [???] as if finding words useless [???] and
murmured : ` i love him . he ' s like that [???] and sometimes it shines through [???]

somehow . but i love him [???] whether or no . '
[???] returned quietly and peered over sam ' s shoulder . looking at
[???] [???] he shut his eyes and [???] away without a sound . sam came to him a
moment later and found him [???] something and muttering to himself .
on
the ground beside him lay two small [???] [???] which he was beginning to eye
[???] .
' [???] always helps [???] ' he said . ` he has brought [???] [???] nice [???] .
but ma ster has gone to sleep [???] and perhaps sam wants to sleep . doesn ' t want
[???] now ? [???] tries to help [???] but he can ' t catch things all in a
minute . '
sam [???] however [???] had no objection to rabbit at all [???] and said so . at least
not to cooked rabbit . all [???] [???] of course [???] can cook [???] for they begin to
learn the art before their letters ( which many never reach ) : but sam was a
good cook [???] even by hobbit reckoning [???] and he had done a good deal of the
camp - cooking on their travels [???] when there was a chance . he still hopefully
carried some of his gear in his pack : a small tinder - box [???] two small shallow
pans [???] the smaller fitting into the larger ; inside them a wooden spoon [???] a
short two - pronged fork and some [???] were stowed ; and hidden at the
bottom of the pack in a flat wooden box a [???] treasure [???] some salt . but
he needed a fire [???] and other things besides . he thought for a bit [???] while he
took out his knife [???] cleaned and whetted it [???] and began to dress the [???] .
he was not going to leave [???] alone asleep even for a few minutes .
' now [???] [???] [???] ' he said [???] ' i ' ve another job for you . go and fill these
pans with water [???] and bring ' em back ! '
' [???] will fetch water [???] yes [???] ' said [???] . ' but what does the hobbit
want all that water for ? he has drunk [???] he has washed . '
' never you mind [???] ' said sam . ` if you can ' t guess [???] you ' ll soon find out .
and the sooner you fetch the water [???] the sooner you ' ll learn . don ' t you
damage one of my pans [???] or i ' ll carve you into [???] . '
while [???] was away sam took another look at [???] . he was still
sleeping quietly [???] but sam was now struck most by the leanness of his face
and hands . ' too thin and drawn he is [???] ' he muttered . ' not right for a hobbit .
if i can get these coneys cooked [???] i ' m going to wake him up . '
sam gathered a pile of the driest fern [???] and then [???] up the bank
collecting a bundle of twigs and broken wood ; the fallen branch of a cedar
at the top gave him a good supply . he cut out some turves at the foot of the

bank just outside the fern - brake [???] and made a shallow hole and laid his fuel
in it . being handy with flint and tinder he soon had a small blaze going . it
made little or no smoke but gave off an [???] scent . he was just stooping
over his fire [???] shielding it and building it up with heavier wood [???] when
[???] returned [???] carrying the pans carefully and grumbling to himself .
he set the pans down [???] and then suddenly saw what sam was doing . he gave
a thin hissing shriek [???] and seemed to be both frightened and angry . ` ach ! sss
- - no ! ' he cried . ` no ! silly [???] [???] foolish [???] yes foolish ! they mustn ' t do
it ! '
` mustn ' t do what ? ' asked sam in surprise .
` not make the [???] red tongues [???] ' [???] [???] . ` fire [???] fire ! it ' s
dangerous [???] yes it is . it burns [???] it kills . and it will bring enemies [???] yes it
will . '
' i don ' t think so [???] ' said sam . ` don ' t see why it should [???] if you don ' t
put wet stuff on it and make a smother . but if it does [???] it does . i ' m going
to risk it [???] anyhow . i ' m going to stew these coneys . '
' stew the [???] ! ' [???] [???] in dismay . ` spoil beautiful meat
[???] saved for you [???] poor hungry [???] ! what for ? what for [???] silly
hobbit ? they are young [???] they are tender [???] they are nice . eat them [???] eat them ! '
he [???] a t the nearest rabbit [???] already skinned and lying by the fire .
` now [???] now ! ' said sam . ` each to his own fashion . our bread chokes you [???]
and raw coney chokes me . if you give me a coney [???] the coney ' s mine [???] see [???] to
cook [???] if i have a mind . and i have . you needn ' t watch me . go and catch
another and eat it as you fancy - - somewhere private and out o ' my sight .
then you won ' t see the fire [???] and i shan ' t see you [???] and we ' ll both be the
happier . i ' ll see the fire don ' t smoke [???] if that ' s any comfort to you . '
[???] withdrew grumbling [???] and [???] into the fern . sam busied
himself with his pans . ` what a hobbit needs with coney [???] ' he said to himself [???]
` is some herbs and roots [???] especially taters - - not to mention bread . herbs
we can manage [???] seemingly . '
` [???] ! ' he called softly . ` third time pays for all . i want some
herbs . ' [???] ' s head peeped out of the fern [???] but his looks were neither
helpful nor friendly . ` a few bay - leaves [???] some thyme and sage [???] will do - -
before the water boils [???] ' said sam .
` no ! ' said [???] . ` [???] is not pleased . and [???] doesn ' t like
smelly leaves . he doesn ' t eat grasses or roots [???] no precious [???] not till he ' s
starving or very sick [???] poor [???] . '

` [???] ' ll get into real true hot water [???] when this water boils [???] if he
don ' t do as he ' s asked [???] ' growled sam . ` sam ' ll put his head in it [???] yes
precious . and i ' d make him look for turnips and [???] [???] and taters too [???] if
it was the time o ' the year . i ' ll bet there ' s all sorts of good things
running wild in this country . i ' d give a lot for half a dozen taters . '
` [???] won ' t go [???] o no precious [???] not this time [???] ' [???] [???] . ` he ' s
frightened [???] and he ' s very tired [???] and this hobbit ' s not nice [???] not nice at
all . [???] won ' t grub for roots and [???] and - - taters . what ' s
taters [???] precious [???] eh [???] what ' s taters ?
` po - ta - toes [???] ' said sam . ' the [???] ' s delight [???] and rare good ballast
for an empty belly . but you won ' t find any [???] so you needn ' t look . but be good
[???] and fetch me the herbs [???] and i ' ll think better of you . what ' s more [???]
if you turn over a new leaf [???] and keep it turned [???] i ' ll cook you some taters
one of these days . i will : fried fish and chips served by s . [???] . you
couldn ' t say no to that . '
` yes [???] yes we could . spoiling nice fish [???] [???] it . give me fish now [???]
and keep [???] chips ! '
` oh you ' re hopeless [???] ' said sam . ' go to sleep ! '
in the end he had to find what he wanted for himself ; but he did not
have to go far [???] not out of sight of the place where his master lay [???] still
sleeping . for a while sam sat musing [???] and tending the fire till the water
boiled . the daylight grew and the air became warm ; the dew faded off turf
and leaf . soon the [???] cut up lay [???] in their pans with the
[???] herbs . almost sam fell asleep as the time went by . he let them stew
for close on an hour [???] testing them now and again with his fork [???] and tasting
the broth .
when he thought all was ready he lifted the pans off the fire [???] and
crept along to [???] . [???] half opened his eyes as sam stood over him [???] and
then he wakened from his dreaming : another gentle [???] [???] dream of
peace .
` hullo [???] sam ! ' he said . ` not resting ? is anything wrong ? what is the
time ? '
` about a couple of hours after [???] [???] ' said sam [???] ` and nigh on half
past eight by shire clocks [???] maybe . but nothing ' s wrong . though it ain ' t
quite what i ' d call right : no stock [???] no onions [???] no taters . i ' ve got a bit of
a stew for you [???] and some broth [???] mr . [???] . do you good . you ' ll have to sup
it in your mug ; or straight from the pan [???] when it ' s cooled a bit . i haven ' t

brought no bowls [???] nor nothing proper . '
[???] yawned and stretched . ' you should have been resting sam [???] ' he
said . ' and lighting a fire was dangerous in these parts . but i do feel
hungry . hmm ! can i smell it from here ? what have you stewed ? '
' a present from [???] [???] ' said sam : ` a brace o ' young coneys ; though i
fancy [???] ' s [???] them now . but there ' s nought to go with them but a
few herbs . '
sam and his master sat just within the fern - brake and ate their stew
from the pans [???] sharing the old fork and spoon . they allowed themselves half
a piece of the elvish [???] each . it seemed a feast .
' wheew ! [???] ! ' sam called and whistled softly . ' come on ! still time
to change your mind . there ' s some left [???] if you want to try stewed coney . '
there was no answer .
` oh well [???] i suppose he ' s gone off to find something for himself . we ' ll
finish it [???] ' said sam .
` and then you must take some sleep [???] ' said [???] .
` don ' t you drop off [???] while i ' m nodding [???] mr . [???] . i don ' t feel too
sure of him . there ' s a good deal of [???] - the bad [???] [???] if you
understand me - in him still [???] and it ' s getting stronger again . not but what i
think he ' d try to [???] me first now . we don ' t see eye to eye [???] and he ' s
not pleased with sam [???] o no precious [???] not pleased at all . '
they finished [???] and sam went off to the stream to [???] his gear . as he
stood up to return [???] he looked back up the slope . at that moment he saw the
sun rise out of the reek [???] or haze [???] or dark shadow [???] or whatever it was [???] that
lay ever to the east [???] and it sent its golden beams down upon the trees and
glades about him . then he noticed a thin spiral of blue - grey [???] smoke [???] plain
to see as it caught the sunlight [???] rising from a thicket above him . with a
shock he realized that this was the smoke from his little cooking - fire [???]
which he had neglected to put out .
` that won ' t do ! never thought it would show like that ! ' he muttered [???]
and he started to hurry back . suddenly he halted and listened . had he heard
a whistle or not ? or was it the call of some strange bird ? if it was a
whistle [???] it did not come from [???] ' s direction . there it went again from
another place ! sam began to run as well as he could [???] .
he found that a small brand [???] burning away to its outer end [???] had kindled
some fern at the edge of the fire [???] and the fern blazing up had set the
turves [???] . hastily he stamped out what was left of the fire [???]

scattered the ashes [???] and laid the turves on the hole . then he crept back to
[???] .
' did you hear a whistle [???] and what sounded like an answer ? ' he asked .
` a few minutes back . i hope it was only a bird [???] but it didn ' t sound quite
like that : more like somebody [???] a bird - call [???] i thought . and i ' m
afraid my bit of fire ' s been smoking . now if i ' ve gone and brought trouble [???]
i ' ll never forgive myself . nor won ' t have a chance [???] maybe ! '
` hush ! ' whispered [???] . ` i thought i heard voices . '
the two [???] [???] their small packs [???] put them on ready for
flight [???] and then [???] deeper into the fern . there they [???]
listening .
there was no doubt of the voices . they were speaking low and [???] [???]
but they were near [???] and coming nearer . then quite suddenly one spoke clearly
close at hand .
` here ! here is where the smoke came from ! ' it said . ` ' twill be nigh at
hand . in the fern [???] no doubt . we shall have it like a coney in a trap . then
we shall learn what kind of thing it is . '
` aye [???] and what it knows ! ' said a second voice .
at once four men came striding through the fern from different
directions . since flight and hiding were no longer possible [???] [???] and sam
sprang to their feet [???] putting back to back and whipping out their small
swords .
if they were astonished at what they saw [???] their captors were even more
astonished . four tall men stood there . two had spears in their hands with
broad bright heads . two had great bows [???] almost of their own height [???] and
great [???] of long green - feathered arrows . all had swords at their sides [???]
and were clad in green and brown of varied hues [???] as if the better to walk
unseen in the glades of [???] . green gauntlets covered their hands [???] and
their faces were hooded and masked with green [???] except for their eyes [???] which
were very keen and bright . at once [???] thought of [???] [???] for these men
were like him in stature and bearing [???] a nd in their manner of speech .
` we have not found what we sought [???] ' said one . ` but what have we found ?
'
' not [???] [???] ' said another [???] releasing the hilt of his sword [???] which he had
seized when he saw the glitter of sting in [???] ' s hand .
` elves ? ' said a third [???] doubtfully .
` nay ! not elves [???] ' said the fourth [???] the tallest [???] and as it appeared the

chief among them . ` elves do not walk in [???] in these days . and elves
are wondrous fair to look upon [???] or so ' tis said . '
' meaning we ' re not [???] i take you [???] ' said sam . ` thank you kindly . and when
you ' ve finished discussing us [???] perhaps you ' ll say who you are [???] and why you
can ' t let two tired travellers rest . '
the tall green man laughed grimly . ` i am [???] [???] captain of [???] [???] '
he said . ` but there are no travellers in this land : only the servants of the
dark tower [???] or of the white . '
` but we are neither [???] ' said [???] . ` and travellers we are [???] whatever
captain [???] may say . '
' then make haste to declare yourselves and your errand [???] ' said [???] .
' we have a work to do [???] and this is no time or place for riddling or
parleying . come ! where is the third of your company ? '
` the third ? '
' yes [???] the [???] fellow that we saw with his nose in the pool down
yonder . he had an ill - favoured look . some spying breed of orc [???] i guess [???] or a
creature of theirs . but he gave us the slip by some fox - trick . '
' i do not know where he is [???] ' said [???] . ' he is only a chance companion
met upon our road ; and i am not answerable for him . if you come on him [???]
spare him . bring him or send him to us . he is only a wretched [???]
creature [???] but i have him under my care for a while . but as for us [???] we are
[???] of the shire [???] far to the north and west [???] beyond many rivers . [???]
son of drogo is my name [???] and with me is [???] son of hamfast [???] a worthy
hobbit in my service . we have come by long ways - - out of [???] [???] or
[???] as some call it . ' here [???] started and grew intent . ' seven
companions we had : one we lost at moria [???] the others we left at parth [???]
above [???] : two of my kin ; a dwarf there was also [???] and an elf [???] and two
men . they were [???] ; and [???] [???] who said that he came out of minas
[???] [???] a city in the south . '
' [???] ! ' all the four men exclaimed .
' [???] son of the lord [???] ? ' said [???] [???] and a strange stern
look came into his face . ' you came with him ? that is news indeed [???] if it be
true . know [???] little strangers [???] that [???] son of [???] was high warden
of the white tower [???] and our captain - general : sorely do we miss him . who are
you then [???] and what had you to do with him ? be swift [???] for the sun is
climbing ! '
' are the riddling words known to you that [???] brought to [???] ?

' [???] replied .
seek for the sword that was broken .
in [???] it dwells .
' the words are known indeed [???] ' said [???] in astonishment . ` it is some
token of your truth that you also know them . '
` [???] whom i named is the bearer of the sword that was broken [???] ' said
[???] . ' and we are the halflings that the rhyme spoke of . '
` that i see [???] ' said [???] thoughtfully . ` or i see that it might be so .
and what is [???] ' s bane ? '
` that is hidden [???] ' answered [???] . ` doubtless it will be made clear in
time . '
` we must learn more of this [???] ' said [???] [???] ` and know what brings you
so far east under the shadow of yonder - - [???] ' he pointed and said no name . ' but
not now . we have business in hand . you are in peril . and you would not have
gone far by field or road this day . there will be hard [???] nigh at
hand ere the day is full . then death [???] or swift flight bark to [???] . i will
leave two to guard you [???] for your good and for mine . wise man trusts not to
chance - meeting on the road in this land . if i return [???] i will speak more with
you . '
' farewell ! ' said [???] [???] bowing low . ` think what you will [???] i am a friend
of all enemies of the one enemy . we would go with you [???] if we halfling folk
could hope to serve you [???] such [???] men and strong as you seem [???] and if my
errand permitted it . may the light shine on your swords ! '
' the halflings are courteous folk [???] whatever else they be [???] ' said
[???] . ` farewell ! '
the [???] sat down again [???] but they said nothing to one another of
their thoughts and doubts . close by [???] just under the [???] shadow of the
dark bay - trees [???] two men remained on guard . they took off their masks now and
again to cool them [???] as the day - heat grew [???] and [???] saw that they were
goodly men [???] pale - skinned [???] dark of hair [???] with grey eyes and faces sad and
proud . they spoke together in soft voices [???] at first using the common speech [???]
but after the manner of older days [???] and then changing to another language of
their own . to his amazement [???] as he listened [???] became aware that it was
the elven - tongue that they spoke [???] or one but little different ; and he looked
at them with wonder [???] for he knew then that they must be d [???] nedain of the
south [???] men of the line of the lords of westernesse .
after a while he spoke to them ; but they were slow and [???] in

answering . they named themselves [???] and damrod [???] soldiers of [???] [???]
and
they were rangers of [???] ; for they were descended from folk who lived
in [???] at one time [???] before it was [???] . from such men the lord
[???] chose his [???] [???] who crossed the [???] secretly ( how or where [???]
they would not say ) to harry the [???] and other enemies that roamed between
the [???] d [???] ath and the river .
` it is close on ten leagues hence to the east - shore of [???] [???] ' said
[???] [???] ' and we seldom come so far afield . but we have a new errand on this
journey : we come to ambush the men of harad . curse them ! '
' aye [???] curse the southrons ! ' said damrod . ` ' tis said that there were
dealings of old between [???] and the kingdoms of the harad in the far
south ; though there was never friendship . in those days our bounds were away
south beyond the mouths of [???] [???] and [???] [???] the nearest of their realms [???]
acknowledged our sway . but that is long since . ' tis many lives of men since
any passed to or fro between us . now of late we have learned that the enemy
has been among them [???] and they are gone over to him [???] or back to him - they
were
ever ready to his will - as have so many also in the east . i doubt not that
the days of [???] are numbered [???] and the walls of minas [???] are doomed [???]
so great is his strength and malice . '
` but still we will not sit idle and let him do all as he would [???] ' said
[???] . ` these cursed southrons come now marching up the ancient roads
to
swell the hosts of the dark tower . yea [???] up the very roads that craft of
[???] made . and they go ever more [???] [???] we learn [???] thinking that the
power of their new master is great enough [???] so that the mere shadow of his
hills will protect them . we come to teach them another lesson . great
strength of them was reported to us some days ago [???] marching north . one of
their regiments is due by our reckoning to pass by [???] some time ere noon - up on
the road above [???] where it passes through the cloven way . the road may pass [???]
but they shall not ! not while [???] is captain . he leads now in all
perilous ventures . but his life is charmed [???] or fate spares him for some
other end . '
their talk died down into a listening silence . all seemed still and
watchful . sam [???] [???] by the edge of the fern - brake [???] peered out . with his

keen hobbit - eyes he saw that many more men were about . he could see
them
stealing up the [???] [???] singly or in long files [???] keeping always to the shade
of grove or thicket [???] or [???] [???] hardly visible in their brown and green
raiment [???] through grass and brake . all were hooded and masked [???] and had
gauntlets on their hands [???] and were armed like [???] and his companions .
before long they had all passed and vanished . the sun rose till it neared
the south . the shadows shrank .
` i wonder where that [???] [???] is ? ' thought sam [???] as he [???]
back into deeper shade . ` he stands a fair chance of being spitted for an
orc [???] or of being roasted by the yellow face . but i fancy he ' ll look after
himself . ' he lay down beside [???] and began to doze .
he woke [???] thinking that he had heard horns blowing . he sat up . it was
now high noon . the guards stood alert and tense in the shadow of the trees .
suddenly the horns rang out louder and beyond mistake from above [???] over the
top of the slope . sam thought that he heard cries and wild shouting also [???]
but the sound was faint [???] as if it came out of some distant cave . then
presently the noise of fighting broke out near at hand [???] just above their
hiding - place . he could hear plainly the ringing grate of steel on steel [???] the
clang of sword on iron cap [???] the dull beat of blade on shield ; men were
yelling and screaming [???] and one clear loud voice was calling [???] ! [???] !
` it sounds like a hundred blacksmiths all smithying together [???] ' said sam
to [???] . ' they ' re as near as i want them now . '
but the noise grew closer . ` they are coming ! ' cried damrod . ` see ! some
of the southrons have broken from the trap and are flying from the road .
there they go ! our men after them [???] and the captain leading . '
sam [???] eager to see more [???] went now and joined the guards . he [???] a
little way up into one of the larger of the bay - trees . for a moment he
caught a glimpse of [???] men in red running down the slope some way off
with green - clad warriors leaping after them [???] hewing them down as they fled .
arrows were thick in the air . then suddenly straight over the rim of their
sheltering bank [???] a man fell [???] [???] through the slender trees [???] nearly on
top of them . he came to rest in the fern a few feet away [???] face downward [???]
green arrow - feathers sticking from his neck below a golden collar . his
scarlet robes were [???] [???] his [???] of [???] brazen plates was
rent and hewn [???] his black [???] of hair braided with gold were drenched with
blood . his brown hand still clutched the hilt of a broken sword .

it was sam ' s first view of a battle of men against men [???] and he did not
like it much . he was glad that he could not see the dead face . he wondered
what the man ' s name was and where he came from ; and if he was really evil of
heart [???] or what lies or threats had led him on the long march from his home ;
and if he would not really rather have stayed there in peace - all in a flash
of thought which was quickly driven from his mind . for just as [???]
stepped towards the fallen body [???] there was a new noise . great crying and
shouting . [???] it sam heard a shrill [???] or trumpeting . and then a
great [???] and [???] . like huge rams dinning on the ground .
' ware ! ware ! ' cried damrod to his companion . ' may the valar turn him
aside ! [???] ! [???] ! '
to his astonishment and terror [???] and lasting delight [???] sam saw a vast
shape crash out of the trees and come careering down the slope . big as a
house [???] much bigger than a house [???] it looked to him [???] a grey - clad moving hill .
fear and wonder [???] maybe [???] enlarged him in the hobbit ' s eyes [???] but the [???] of
harad was indeed a beast of vast bulk [???] and the like of him does not walk now
in middle - earth ; his kin that live still in latter days are but memories of
his girth and majesty . on he came [???] straight towards the watchers [???] and then
[???] aside in the nick of time [???] passing only a few yards away [???] rocking
the ground beneath their feet : his great legs like trees [???] enormous sail - like
ears spread out [???] long snout [???] like a huge serpent about to strike .
his small red eyes raging . his [???] hornlike [???] were bound with bands
of gold and dripped with blood . his [???] of scarlet and gold flapped
about him in wild [???] . the ruins of what seemed a very war - tower lay
upon his heaving back [???] smashed in his furious passage thr [???] the woods ; and
high upon his neck still desperately clung a tiny figure - the body of a
mighty warrior [???] a giant among the [???] .
on the great beast thundered [???] [???] in blind wrath through pool
and thicket . arrows skipped and snapped harmlessly about the triple hide of
his flanks . men of both sides fled before him [???] but many he overtook and
crushed to the ground . soon he was lost to view [???] still trumpeting and
stamping far away . what became of him sam never heard : whether he escaped
to
roam the wild for a time [???] until he perished far from his home or was trapped
in some deep pit ; or whether he raged on until he [???] in the great river
and was swallowed up .
sam drew a deep breath . ' an [???] it was ! ' he said . ` s o there are

[???] [???] and i have seen one . what a life ! but no one at home will ever
believe me . well [???] if that ' s over [???] i ' ll have a bit of sleep . '
' sleep while you may [???] ' said [???] . ` but the captain will return [???] if
he is [???] ; and when he comes we shall depart swiftly . we shall be pursued
as soon as news of our deed reaches the enemy [???] and that will not be long . '
` go quietly when you must ! ' said sam . ` no need to disturb my sleep . i
was walking all night . '
[???] laughed . ` i do not think the captain will leave you here [???]
master [???] [???] ' he said . ' but you shall see . '




chapter 5 . the window on the west



it seemed to sam that he had only dozed for a few minutes when he awoke
to find that it was late afternoon and [???] had come back . he had brought
many men with him ; indeed all the [???] of the foray were now gathered
on the slope nearby [???] two or three hundred strong . they sat in a wide
[???] [???] between the arms of which [???] was seated on the ground [???]
while [???] stood before him . it looked strangely like the trial of a
prisoner .
sam crept out from the fern [???] but no one paid any attention to him [???] and
he placed himself at the end of the rows of men [???] where he could see and hear
all that wa s going on . he watched and listened intently [???] ready to dash to
his master ' s aid if needed . he could see [???] ' s face [???] which was now
[???] : it was stern and commanding [???] and a keen wit lay behind his
searching glance . doubt was in the grey eyes that gazed steadily at [???] .
sam soon became aware that the captain was not satisfied with [???] ' s
account of himself at several points : what part he had to play in the
company that set out from [???] ; why he had left [???] ; and where he
was now going . in particular he returned often to [???] ' s bane . plainly he
saw that [???] was concealing from him some matter of great importance .
' but it was at the coming of the halfling that [???] ' s bane should
waken [???] or so one must read the words [???] ' he insisted . ` if then you are the
halfling that was named [???] doubtless you brought this thing [???] whatever it may
be [???] to the council of which you speak [???] and there [???] saw it . do you deny
it ? '
[???] made no answer . ' so ! ' said [???] . ` i wish then to learn from
you more of it ; for what concerns [???] concerns me . an orc - arrow slew
[???] [???] so far as old tales tell . but orc - arrows are plenty [???] and the sight
of one would not be taken as a sign of doom by [???] of [???] . had you
this thing in keeping ? it is hidden [???] you say ; but is not that because you
choose to hide it ? '
' no [???] not because i choose [???] ' answered [???] . ` it does not belong to me .
it does not belong to any mortal [???] great or small ; though if any could claim
it [???] it would be [???] son of [???] [???] whom i named [???] the leader of our
company from moria to [???] . '

' why so [???] and not [???] [???] prince of the city that the sons of [???]
founded ? '
' because [???] is descended in direct lineage [???] father to father [???] from
[???] [???] ' s son himself . and the sword that he bears was [???] ' s
sword . '
a murmur of astonishment ran through all the ring of men . some cried
aloud : ' the sword of [???] ! the sword of [???] comes to minas [???] !
great tidings ! ' but [???] ' s face was [???] .
` maybe [???] ' he said . ` but so great a claim will need to be established and
clear proofs will be required [???] should this [???] ever come to minas
[???] . he had not come [???] nor any of your company [???] when i set out six days
ago . '
' [???] was satisfied of that claim [???] ' said [???] . ` indeed [???] if [???]
were here [???] he would answer all your questions . and since he was already at
[???] many days back [???] and intended then to go straight to your city [???] if you
return [???] you may soon learn the answers there . my part in the company was
known to him [???] as to all the others . for it was appointed to me by [???] of
[???] himself before the whole council . on that errand i came into this
country [???] but it is not mine to reveal to any outside the company . yet those
who claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder it . '
[???] ' s tone was proud [???] whatever he felt [???] and sam approved of it ; but
it did not appease [???] .
` so ! ' he said . ` you bid me mind my own affairs [???] and get me back home [???]
and let you be . [???] will tell all [???] when he comes . when he comes [???] say
you ! were you a friend of [???] ? '
vividly before [???] ' s mind came the memory of [???] ' s assault upon
him [???] and for a moment he [???] . [???] ' s eyes watching him grew harder .
' [???] was a valiant member of our company ' said [???] at length . ' yes [???] i
was his friend [???] for my part . '
[???] smiled grimly . ` then you would grieve to learn that [???] is
dead ? '
' i would grieve indeed [???] ' said [???] . then catching the look in
[???] ' s eyes [???] he faltered . ' dead ? ' he said . ` do you mean that he is dead [???]
and that you knew it ? you have been trying to trap me in words [???] playing with
me ? or are you now trying to snare me with a falsehood ? '
` i would not snare even an orc with a falsehood [???] ' said [???] .
` how then did he die [???] and how do you know of it ? since you say that

none of the company had reached the city when you left . '
' as to the manner of his death [???] i had hoped that his friend and
companion would tell me how it was . '
` but he was alive and strong when we parted . and he lives still for all
that i know . though surely there are many perils in the world . '
` many indeed [???] ' said [???] [???] ` and treachery not the least . '
sam had been getting more and more impatient and angry at this
conversation . these last words were more than he could bear [???] and bursting
into the middle of the ring [???] he strode up to his master ' s side .
' begging your pardon [???] mr . [???] [???] ' he said [???] ` but this has gone on long
enough . he ' s no right to talk to you so . after all you ' ve gone through [???] as
much for his good and all these great men as for anyone else .
' see here [???] captain ! ' he planted himself squarely in front of [???]
his hands on his hips [???] and a look on his face as if he was addressing a
young hobbit who had offered him what he called ` sauce ' when questioned
about visits to the orchard . there was some murmuring [???] but also some grins
on the faces of the men looking on : the sight of their captain sitting on
the ground and eye to eye with a young hobbit [???] legs well apart [???] [???]
with wrath [???] was one beyond their experience . ` see here ! ' he said . ` what are
you driving at ? let ' s come to the point before all the [???] of [???] come
down on us ! if you think my master murdered this [???] and then ran away [???]
you ' ve got no sense ; but say it [???] and have done ! and then let us know what
you mean to do about it . but it ' s a pity that folk as talk about fighting
the enemy can ' t let others do their bit in their own way without
[???] . he ' d be mighty pleased [???] if he could see you now . think he ' d got
a new friend [???] he would . '
` patience ! ' said [???] [???] but without anger . ` do not speak before your
master [???] whose wit is greater than yours . and i do not need any to teach me
of our peril . even so [???] i spare a brief time [???] in order to judge justly in a
hard matter . were i as hasty as you [???] i might have slain you long ago . for i
am commanded to slay all whom i find in this land without the leave of the
lord of [???] . but i do not slay man or beast needlessly [???] and not gladly
even when it is needed . neither do i talk in vain . so be comforted . sit by
your master [???] and be silent ! '
sam sat down heavily with a red face . [???] turned to [???] again :
' you asked how do i know that the son of [???] is dead . tidings of death
have many wings . night oft brings news to near kindred [???] ' tis said . [???]

was my brother . '
a shadow of sorrow passed over his face . ` do you remember aught of
special mark that the lord [???] bore with him among his gear ? '
[???] thought for a moment [???] fearing some further trap [???] and wondering
how this debate would turn in the end . he had hardly saved the ring from the
proud grasp of [???] [???] and how he would fare now among so many men [???]
warlike
and strong [???] he did not know . yet he felt in his heart that [???] [???] though
he was much like his brother in looks [???] was a man less self - regarding [???] both
sterner and wiser . ' i remember that [???] bore a horn [???] ' he said at last .
` you remember well [???] and as one who has in truth seen him [???] ' said
[???] . ` then maybe you can see it in your mind ' s eye : a great horn of the
wild ox of the east [???] bound with silver [???] and written with ancient characters .
that horn the eldest son of our house has borne for many generations ; and it
is said that if it be blown at need anywhere within the bounds of [???] [???] as
the realm was of old [???] its voice will not pass [???] .
' five days ere i set out on this venture [???] eleven days ago at about this
hour of the day [???] i heard the blowing of that horn : from the northward it
seemed [???] but dim [???] as if it were but an echo in the mind . a boding of ill we
thought it [???] my father and i [???] for no tidings had we heard of [???] since he
went away [???] and no watcher on our borders had seen him pass . and on the third
night after another and a stranger thing befell me .
' i sat at night by the waters of [???] [???] in the grey dark under the
young pale moon [???] watching the ever - moving stream ; and the sad reeds were
rustling . so do we ever watch the shores nigh [???] [???] which our enemies
now partly hold [???] and issue from it to harry our lands . bu t that night all
the world slept at the midnight hour . then i saw [???] or it seemed that i saw [???] a
boat floating on the water [???] [???] grey [???] a small boat of a strange
fashion with a high prow . and there was none to row or steer it .
` an awe fell on me [???] for a pale light was round it . but i rose and went
to the bank [???] and began to walk out into the stream [???] for i was drawn towards
it . then the boat turned towards me [???] and stayed its pace [???] and floated slowly
by within my hand ' s reach [???] yet i durst not handle it . it waded deep [???] as if
it were heavily burdened [???] and it seemed to me as it passed under my gaze
that it was almost filled with clear water [???] from which came the light ; and
lapped in the water a warrior lay asleep .
` a broken sword was on his knee . i saw many wounds on him . it was

[???] [???] my brother [???] dead . i knew his gear [???] his sword [???] his beloved face . one
thing only i missed : his horn . one thing only i knew not : a fair belt [???] as it
were of linked golden leaves [???] about his waist . [???] ! i cried . where is
thy horn ? whither goest thou ? o [???] ! but he was gone . the boat turned
into the stream and passed [???] on into the night . dreamlike it was .
and yet no dream [???] for there was no waking . and i do not doubt that he is
dead and has passed down the river to the sea . '
' alas ! ' said [???] . ' that was indeed [???] as i knew him . for the
golden belt was given to him in [???] by the lady [???] . she it was
that clothed us as you see us [???] in elven - grey . this brooch is of the same
[???] . ' he touched the green and silver leaf that fastened his cloak
beneath his throat .
[???] looked closely at it . ` it is beautiful [???] ' he said . ' yes [???] ' tis
work of the same craft . so then you passed through the land of [???] ?
[???] it was named of old [???] but long now it has lain beyond the
knowledge of men [???] ' he added softly [???] regarding [???] with a new wonder in his
eyes . ` much that was strange about you i begin now to understand . will you
not tell me more ? for it is a bitter thought that [???] died [???] within sight
of the land of his home . '
' no more can i say than i have said [???] ' answered [???] . ` though your tale
fills me with [???] . a vision it was that you saw [???] i think [???] and no
more [???] some shadow of evil fortune that has been or will be . unless indeed it
is some lying trick of the enemy . i have seen the faces of fair warriors of
old laid in sleep beneath the [???] of the dead marshes [???] or seeming so by
his foul arts . '
' nay [???] it was not so [???] ' said [???] . ' for his works fill the heart with
loathing ; but my heart was filled with grief and pity . '
` yet how could such a thing have happened in truth ? ' asked [???] . ' for
no boat could have been carried over the stony hills from tol brandir ; and
[???] purposed to go home across the [???] and the fields of [???] .
and
yet how could any vessel ride the foam of the great falls and not founder in
the boiling [???] [???] though laden with water ? '
' i know not [???] ' said [???] . ' but whence came the boat ? '
` from [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' in three such boats we rowed down [???] to
the falls . they also were of elven - work . '
' you passed through the hidden land [???] ' said [???] [???] ` but it seems that

you little understood its power . if men have dealings with the mistress of
magic who dwells in the golden wood [???] then they may look for strange things
to follow . for it is perilous for mortal man to walk out of the world of
this sun [???] and few of old came thence unchanged [???] ' tis said .
` [???] [???] o [???] ! ' he cried . ` what did she say to you [???] the lady that
dies not ? what did she see ? what woke in your heart then ? why went you ever
to [???] [???] and came not by your own road [???] upon the horses of
[???]
riding home in the morning ? '
then turning again to [???] [???] he spoke in a quiet voice once more . ' to
those questions i guess that you could make some answer [???] [???] son of drogo .
but not here or now . maybe . but lest you still should think my tale a
vision [???] i will tell you this . the horn of [???] at least returned in
truth [???] and not in seeming . the horn came [???] but it was cloven in two [???] as it
were by axe or sword . the shards came severally to shore : one was found
among the reeds where watchers of [???] lay [???] northwards below the infalls
of the [???] ; the other was found spinning on the flood by one who had an
errand in the water . strange chances [???] but murder will out [???] ' tis said .
' and now the horn of the elder son lies in two pieces upon the lap of
[???] [???] sitting in his high chair [???] waiting for news . and you can tell me
nothing of the cleaving of the horn ? '
' no [???] i did not know of it [???] ' said [???] . ` but the day when you heard it
blowing [???] if your reckoning is true [???] was the day when we parted [???] when i and
my servant left the company . and now your tale fills me with dread . for if
[???] was then in peril and was slain [???] i must fear that all my companions
perished too . and they were my kindred and my friends .
` will you not put aside your dou bt of me and let me go ? i am weary [???] and
full of grief [???] and afraid . but i have a deed to do [???] or to attempt [???] before i
too am slain . and the more need of haste [???] if we two halflings are all that
remain of our fellowship .
' go back [???] [???] [???] valiant captain of [???] [???] and defend your city
while you may [???] and let me go where my doom takes me . '
` for me there is no comfort in our speech together [???] ' said [???] ; ` but
you surely draw from it more dread than need be . unless the people of [???]
themselves came to him [???] who arrayed [???] as for a funeral ? not [???] or
servants of the nameless . some of your company [???] i guess [???] live still .
` but whatever befell on the north march [???] you [???] [???] [???] i doubt no longer .

if hard days have made me any judge of men ' s words and faces [???] then i may
make a guess at halflings ! though [???] ' and now he smiled [???] ` there is something
strange about you [???] [???] [???] an elvish air [???] maybe . but more lies upon our words
together than i thought at first . i should now take you back to minas [???]
to answer there to [???] [???] and my life will justly be forfeit [???] if i now
choose a course that proves ill for my city . so i will not decide in haste
what is to be done . yet we must move hence without more delay . '
he sprang to his feet and issued some orders . at once the men who were
gathered round him broke up into small groups [???] and went off this way and
that [???] vanishing quickly into the shadows of the rocks and trees . soon only
[???] and damrod remained .
' now you [???] [???] and [???] [???] will come with me and my guards [???] ' said
[???] . ` you cannot go along the road southwards [???] if that was your purpose .
it will be unsafe for some days [???] and always more closely watched after this
affray than it has been yet . and you cannot [???] i think [???] go far today in any
case [???] for you are weary . and so are we . we are going now to a secret place
we have [???] somewhat less than ten miles from here . the [???] and spies of the
enemy have not found it yet [???] and if they did [???] we could hold it long even
against many . there we may lie up and rest for a while [???] and you with us . in
the morning i will decide what is best for me to do [???] and for you . '
there was nothing for [???] to do but to fall in with this request [???] or
order . it seemed in any case a wise course for the moment [???] since this foray
of the men of [???] had made a journey in [???] more dangerous than
ever .
they set out at once : [???] and damrod a little ahead [???] and [???]
with [???] and sam behind . [???] the hither side of the pool where the
[???] had bathed [???] they crossed the stream [???] climbed a long bank [???] and passed
into green - shadowed [???] that marched ever downwards and
westwards .
while they walked [???] as swiftly as the [???] could go [???] they talked in hushed
voices .
' i broke off our speech together [???] ' said [???] [???] ' not only because time
pressed [???] as master [???] had reminded me [???] but also because we were
drawing
near to matters that were better not debated openly before many men . it was
for that reason that i turned rather to the matter of my brother and let be
[???] ' s bane . you were not wholly frank with me [???] [???] . '

` i told no lies [???] and of the truth all i could [???] ' said [???] .
` i do not blame you [???] ' said [???] . ' you spoke with skill in a hard
place [???] and wisely [???] it seemed to me . but i learned or guessed more from you
than your words said . you were not friendly with [???] [???] or you did not
part in friendship . you [???] and master [???] [???] too [???] i guess have some
grievance . now i loved him dearly [???] and would gladly avenge his death [???] yet i
knew him well . [???] ' s bane - - i would hazard that [???] ' s bane lay
between you and was a cause of contention in your company . clearly it is a
mighty [???] of some sort [???] and such things do not breed peace among
confederates [???] not if aught may be learned from ancient tales . do i not hit
near the mark ? '
` near [???] ' said [???] [???] ' but not in the gold . there was no contention in
our company [???] though there was doubt : doubt which way we should take from
the
emyn muil . but be that as it may [???] ancient tales teach us also the peril of
rash words concerning such things as - - [???] . '
' ah [???] then it is as i thought : your trouble was with [???] alone . he
wished this thing brou ght to minas [???] . alas ! it is a crooked fate that
seals your lips who saw him last [???] and holds from me that which i long to
know : what was in his heart and thought in his latest hours . whether he
erred or no [???] of this i am sure : he died well [???] achieving some good thing . his
face was more beautiful even than in life .
` but [???] [???] [???] i pressed you hard at first about [???] ' s bane . forgive
me ! it was unwise in such an hour and place . i had not had time for thought .
we had had a hard fight [???] and there was more than enough to fill my mind . but
even as i spoke with you [???] i drew nearer to the mark [???] and so deliberately
shot wider . for you must know that much is still preserved of ancient lore
among the rulers of the city that is not spread abroad . we of my house are
not of the line of [???] . though the blood of n [???] menor is in us . for we
reckon back our line to mardil [???] the good steward [???] who ruled in the king ' s
stead when he went away to war . and that was king [???] [???] last of the line
of [???] [???] and childless [???] and he came never back . and the stewards have
governed the city since that day [???] though it was many generations of men ago .
' and this i remember of [???] as a boy [???] when we together learned the
tale of our sires and the history of our city [???] that always it displeased him
that his father was not king . [???] how many hundreds of years needs it to make a
steward a king [???] if the king returns not ? [???] he asked . [???] few years [???] maybe [???] in

other places of less royalty [???] [???] my father answered . [???] in [???] ten thousand
years would not suffice . [???] alas ! poor [???] . does that not tell you
something of him ? '
' it does [???] ' said [???] . ` yet always he treated [???] with honour . '
' i doubt it not [???] ' said [???] . ` if he were satisfied of [???] ' s
claim as you say [???] he would greatly reverence him . but the pinch has not yet
come . they had not yet reached minas [???] or become rivals in her wars .
` but i stray . we in the house of [???] know much ancient lore by
long tradition [???] and there are moreover in our [???] many things
preserved : books and tablets writ on withered [???] [???] yea [???] and on stone [???]
and on leaves of silver and of gold [???] in divers characters . some none can now
read ; and for the rest [???] few ever unlock them . i can read a little in them [???]
for i have had teaching . it was these records that brought the grey pilgrim
to us . i first saw him when i was a child [???] and he has been twice or thrice
since then . '
' the grey pilgrim ? ' said [???] . ' had he a name ? '
' [???] we called him in elf - fashion [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and he was
content . many are my names in many countries [???] he said . [???] among the
elves [???] [???] to the [???] ; [???] i was in my youth in the west that is
forgotten [???] in the south [???] [???] in the north [???] ; to the east i go
not . '
' [???] ! ' said [???] . ' i thought it was he . [???] the grey dearest
of counsellors . leader of our company . he was lost in moria . '
' [???] was lost ! ' said [???] . ' an evil fate seems to have
pursued your fellowship . it is hard indeed to believe that one of so great
wisdom [???] and of power - - for many wonderful things he did among us - - could
perish [???] and so much lore be taken from the world . are you sure of this [???] and
that he did not just leave you and depart where he would ? '
' alas ! yes [???] ' said [???] . ` i saw him fall into the [???] . '
' i see that there is some great tale of dread in this . ' said [???]
` which perhaps you may tell me in the evening - time . this [???] was [???] i
now guess [???] more than a lore - master : a great mover of the deeds that are done
in our time . had he been among us to consult concerning the hard words of
our dream [???] he could have made them clear to us without need of messenger .
yet [???] maybe [???] he would not have done so [???] and the journey of [???] was
doomed . [???] never spoke to us of what was to be [???] nor did he reveal
his purposes . he got leave of [???] [???] how i do not know [???] to look at the

secrets of our treasury [???] and i learned a little of him [???] when he would teach
( and that was seldom ) . ever he would search and would question us above all
else concerning the great battle that was fought upon [???] in the
beginning of [???] [???] when he whom we do not name was over thrown . and
he was
eager for stories of [???] [???] though of him we had less to tell ; for nothing
certain was ever known among us of his end . '
now [???] ' s voice sank to a whisper . ' but this much i learned or
guessed [???] and i have kept it ever secr et in my heart since : that [???] took
somewhat from the hand of the [???] [???] ere he went away from [???] [???]
never
to be seen among mortal men again . here i thought was the answer to
[???] ' s questioning . but it seemed then a matter that concerned only
the seekers after ancient learning . nor when the riddling words of our dream
were debated among us [???] did i think of [???] ' s bane as being this same
thing . for [???] was [???] and slain by orc - arrows [???] according to the
only legend that we knew [???] and [???] had never told me more .
` what in truth this thing is i cannot yet guess ; but some [???] of
power and peril it must be . a fell weapon [???] perchance [???] devised by the dark
lord . if it were a thing that gave advantage in battle . i can well believe
that [???] [???] the proud and fearless [???] often rash [???] ever anxious for the
victory of minas [???] ( and his own glory therein ) [???] might desire such a
thing and be allured by it . alas that ever he went on that errand ! i should
have been chosen by my father and the elders but he put himself forward . as
being the older and the hardier ( both true ) [???] and he would not be stayed .
' but fear no more ! i would not take this thing [???] if it lay by the
highway . not were minas [???] falling in ruin and i alone could save her [???]
so [???] using the weapon of the dark lord for her good and my glory . no . i do
not wish for such triumphs [???] [???] son of drogo . '
' neither did the council [???] ' said [???] . ' nor do i . i would have nothing
to do with such matters . '
` for myself [???] ' said [???] [???] ' i would see the white tree in flower again
in the courts of the kings [???] and the silver crown return [???] and minas [???] in
peace : minas anor again as of old [???] full of light [???] high and fair [???] beautiful
as a queen among other queens : not a mistress of many slaves [???] nay [???] not even
a kind mistress of willing slaves . war must be [???] while we defend our lives
against a destroyer who would devour all ; but i do not love the bright sword

for its sharpness [???] nor the arrow for its swiftness [???] nor the warrior for his
glory . i love only that which they defend : the city of the men of n [???] menor ;
and i would have her loved for her memory [???] her ancientry [???] her beauty [???] and
her present wisdom . not feared [???] save as men may fear the dignity of a man [???]
old and wise .
' so fear me not ! i do not ask you to tell me more . i do not even ask
you to tell me whether i now speak nearer the mark . but if you will trust
me [???] it may be that i can advise you in your present quest [???] whatever that
be - yes [???] and even aid you . '
[???] made no answer . almost he yielded to the desire for help and
counsel [???] to tell this grave young man [???] whose words seemed so wise and fair [???]
all that was in his mind . but something held him back . his heart was heavy
with fear and sorrow : if he and sam were indeed [???] as seemed likely [???] all that
was now left of the nine walkers [???] then he was in sole command of the secret
of their errand . better mistrust [???] than rash words . and the memory
of bor [???] [???] of the dreadful change that the lure of the ring had worked in
him [???] was very present to his mind [???] when he looked at [???] and listened to
his voice : unlike they were [???] and yet also much akin .
they walked on in silence for a while [???] passing like grey and green
shadows under the old trees [???] their feet making no sound ; above them many
birds sang [???] and the sun [???] on the polished roof of dark leaves in the
[???] woods of [???] .
sam had taken no part in the conversation [???] though he had listened ; and
at the same time he had attended with his keen hobbit ears to all the soft
woodland noises about them . one thing he had noted [???] that in all the talk the
name of [???] had not once come up . he was glad [???] though he felt that it was
too much to hope that he would never hear it again . he soon became aware
also that though they walked alone [???] there were many men close at hand : not
only damrod and [???] flitting in and out of the shadows ahead [???] but others
on either side [???] all making their swift secret way to some appointed place .
once [???] looking suddenly back [???] as if some prickle of the skin told him
that he was watched from behind [???] he thought he caught a brief glimpse of a
small dark shape slipping behind a tree - trunk . he opened his mouth to speak
and shut it again . ` i ' m not sure of it [???] ' he said to himself [???] ' and why should
i remind them of the old villain [???] if they choose to forget him ? i wish i
could ! '
so they passed on [???] until the [???] grew thinner and the land began

to fall more steeply . then they turned aside again [???] to the right [???] and came
quickly to a small river in a narrow gorge : it was the same stream that
trickled far above out of the round pool [???] now grown to a swift torrent [???]
leaping down over many stones in a deep - cloven bed [???] [???] with ilex and
dark box - woods . looking west they could see [???] below them in a haze of light [???]
[???] and broad meads [???] and [???] far off in the westering sun the wide
waters of the [???] .
' here [???] alas ! i must do you a [???] [???] ' said [???] . [???] i hope you
will pardon it to one who has so far made his orders give way to courtesy as
not to slay you or to bind you . but it is a command that no stranger [???] not
even one of [???] that fights with us [???] sha ll see the path we now go with
open eyes . i must blindfold you . '
` as you will [???] ' said [???] . ' even the elves do likewise at need [???] and
[???] we crossed the borders of fair [???] . [???] the dwarf took
it ill [???] but the [???] endured it . '
` it is to no place so fair that i shall lead you [???] ' said [???] . ' but i
am glad that you will take this willingly and not by force . '
he called softly and immediately [???] and damrod stepped out of the
trees and came back to him . ' blindfold these guests [???] ' said [???] .
` securely [???] but not so as to discomfort them . do not tie their hands . they
will give their word not to try and see . i could trust them to shut their
eyes of their own accord [???] but eyes will blink [???] if the feet stumble . lead
them so that they do not falter . '
with green scarves the two guards now bound up the [???] ' eyes and
drew their hoods down almost to their mouths ; then quickly they took each
one by the hand and went on their way . all that [???] and sam knew of this
last mile of the road they learned from guessing in the dark . after a little
they found that they were on a path descending steeply ; soon it grew so
narrow that they went in single file [???] brushing a stony wall on either side ;
their guards steered them from behind with hands laid firmly on their
shoulders . now and again they came to rough places and were lifted from
their feet for a while [???] and then set down again . always the noise of the
running water was on their right hand [???] and it grew nearer and louder . at
length they were halted . quickly [???] and damrod turned them about [???]
several times [???] and they lost all sense of direction . they climbed upwards a
little : it seemed cold and the noise of the stream had become faint . then
they were picked up and carried down [???] down many steps [???] and round a corner .

suddenly they heard the water again [???] loud now [???] rushing and [???] . all
round them it seemed [???] and they felt a fine rain on their hands and cheeks .
at last they were set on their feet once more . for a moment they stood so [???]
half fearful [???] blindfold [???] not knowing where they were ; and no one spoke .
then came the voice of [???] close behind . ` let them see ! ' he said .
the scarves were removed and their hoods drawn back [???] and they [???] and
gasped .
they stood on a wet floor of polished stone [???] the doorstep [???] as it were [???]
of a rough - hewn gate of rock opening dark behind them . but in front a thin
veil of water was hung [???] so near that [???] cou ld have put an [???]
arm into it . it faced westward . the level shafts of the setting sun behind
beat upon it [???] and the red light was broken into many [???] beams of
ever - changing colour . it was as if they stood at the window of some
elven - tower [???] curtained with threaded jewels of silver and gold [???] and ruby [???]
[???] and [???] [???] all kindled with an [???] fire .
' at least by good chance we came at the right hour to reward you for
your patience [???] ' said [???] . ` this is the window of the sunset [???] [???]
annyn [???] fairest of all the falls of [???] [???] land of many fountains . few
strangers have ever seen it . but there is no kingly hall behind to match it .
enter now and see ! '
even as he spoke the sun sank [???] and the fire faded in the flowing water .
they turned and passed under the low forbidding arch . at once they found
themselves in a rock - chamber [???] wide and rough [???] with an uneven stooping roof .
a few torches were kindled and cast a dim light on the [???] ing walls .
many men were already there . others were still coming in by twos and threes
through a dark narrow door on one side . as their eyes grew accustomed to the
gloom the [???] saw that the cave was larger than they had guessed and was
filled with gr eat store of arms and [???] .
' well [???] here is our [???] [???] ' said [???] . ` not a place of great ease
but here you may pass the night in peace . it is dry at least [???] and there is
food [???] though no fire . at one time the water flowed down through this cave
and out of the arch [???] but its course was changed further up the gorge [???] by
workmen of old [???] and the stream sent down in a fall of doubled height over
the rocks far above . all the ways into this grot were then sealed against
the entry of water or aught else [???] all save one . there are now but two ways
out : that passage yonder by which you entered blindfold [???] and through the
window - curtain into a deep bowl filled with knives of stone . now rest a

while [???] until the evening meal is set . '
the [???] were taken to a corner and given a low bed to lie on [???] if
they wished . meanwhile men busied themselves about the cave [???] quietly and in
orderly quickness . light tables were taken from the walls and set up on
trestles and laden with gear . this was plain and [???] for the most
part [???] but all well and fairly [???] made : round platters [???] bowls and dishes of
[???] brown clay or turned box - wood [???] smooth and clean . here and there was a
cup or basin of polished [???] ; and a [???] of plain silver was set by the
captain ' s seat in the middle of the inmost table .
[???] went about among the men [???] questioning each as he came in [???] in a
soft voice . some came back from the pursuit of the southrons ; others [???] left
behind as scouts near the roa d [???] came in latest . all the southrons had been
accounted for [???] save only the great [???] : what happened to him none could
say . of the enemy no movement could be seen ; not even an orc - spy was
abroad .
' you saw and heard nothing [???] anborn ? ' [???] asked of the latest comer .
` well [???] no [???] lord [???] ' said the man . ` no orc at least . but i saw [???] or thought
i saw [???] something a little strange . it was getting deep [???] [???] when the eyes
make things greater than they should be . so perhaps it may have been no more
than a [???] . ' sam pricked up his ears at this . ' yet if so [???] it was a
black [???] [???] and i saw no tail . ' twas like a shadow on the ground [???] and it
whisked behind a tree - trunk when i drew nigh and went up aloft as swift as
any [???] could . you wi ll not have us slay wild beasts for no purpose [???]
and it seemed no more [???] so i tried no arrow . it was too dark for sure
shooting anyway [???] and the creature was gone into the gloom of the leaves in a
[???] . but i stayed for a while [???] for it seemed strange [???] and then i
hastened back . i thought i heard the thing hiss at me from high above as i
turned away . a large [???] [???] maybe . perhaps under the shadow of the
[???] some of the beasts of [???] are wandering hither to our
woods .
they have black [???] there [???] ' tis said . '
` perhaps [???] ' said [???] . ` but that would be an ill omen [???] if it were so .
we do not want the escapes of [???] in [???] . ' sam fancied that he
gave a swift glance towards the [???] as he spoke ; but sam said nothing .
for a while he and [???] lay back and watched the torchlight [???] and the men
moving to and fro speaking in hushed voices . then suddenly [???] fell
asleep .

sam struggled with himself [???] [???] this way and that . ` he may be a ll
right [???] ' he thought [???] ' and then he may not . fair speech may hide a foul
heart . ' he yawned . ` i could sleep for a week [???] and i ' d be better for it . and
what can i do [???] if i do keep awake [???] me all alone [???] and all these great men
about ? nothing [???] sam [???] ; but you ' ve got to keep awake all the same . ' and
somehow he managed it . the light faded from the cave door [???] and the grey veil
of falling water grew dim and was lost in gathering shadow . always the sound
of the water went on [???] never changing its note [???] morning or evening or night .
it murmured and whispered of sleep . sam stuck his [???] in his eyes .
now more torches were being lit . a cask of wine was broached . storage
barrels were being opened . men were fetching water from the fall . some were
laving their hands in basins . a wide copper bowl and a white cloth were
brought to [???] and he washed .
` wake our guests [???] ' he said [???] ` and take them water . it is time to eat . '
[???] sat up and yawned and stretched . sam [???] not used to being waited
on [???] looked with some surprise at the tall man who bowed [???] holding a basin of
water before him .
' put it on the ground [???] master [???] if you please ! ' he said . ' easier for me
and you . ' then to the astonishment and [???] of the men he [???] his
head into the cold water and [???] his neck and ears .
' is it the custom in your land to wash the head before supper ? ' said
the man who waited on the [???] .
` no [???] before breakfast [???] ' said sam . ` but if you ' re short of sleep cold
water on the neck ' s like rain on a wilted [???] . there ! now i can keep
awake long enough to eat a bit . '
they were led then to seats beside [???] : barrels covered with pelts
and high enough above the benches of the men for their convenience . before
they ate [???] [???] and all his men turned and faced west in a moment of
silence . [???] signed to [???] and sam that they should do likewise .
' so we always do . ' he said [???] as they sat down : ` we look towards n [???] menor
that was [???] and beyond to [???] that is [???] and to that which is beyond
[???] and will ever be . have you no such custom at meat ? '
` no [???] ' said [???] [???] feeling strangely rustic and [???] . ` but if we
are guests [???] we bow to our host [???] and after we have eaten we rise and thank
him . '
' that we do also [???] ' said [???] .
after so long journeying and camping [???] and days spent [???] n the lonely

wild [???] the evening meal seemed a feast to the [???] : to drink pale yellow
wine [???] cool and fragrant [???] and eat bread and butter [???] and salted meats [???] and
dried fruits [???] and good red cheese [???] with clean hands and clean knives and
plates . neither [???] nor sam refused anything that was offered [???] nor a
second [???] nor indeed a third helping . the wine coursed in their veins and
tired limbs [???] and they felt glad and easy of heart as they had not done since
they left the land of [???] .
when all was done [???] led them to a recess at the back of the cave [???]
partly screened by curtains ; and a chair and two stools were brought there .
a little [???] lamp burned in a niche .
` you may soon desire to sleep [???] ' he said [???] ' and especially good [???] [???]
who would not close his eyes before he ate - - whether for fear of blunting
the edge of a noble hunger [???] or for fear of me [???] i do not know . but it is not
good to sleep too soon after meat [???] and that following a fast . let us talk a
while . on your journey from [???] there must have been many things to
tell . and you [???] too [???] would perhaps wish to learn something of us and the
lands where you now are . tell me of [???] my brother [???] and of old
[???] [???] and of the fair people of [???] . '
[???] no longer felt sleepy and he was willing to talk . but though the
food and wine had put him at his ease [???] he had not lost all his caution . sam
was beaming and humming to himself [???] but when [???] spoke he was at first
content to listen [???] only occasionally venturing to make an exclamation of
agreement .
[???] told many tales [???] yet always he steered the matter away from the
quest of the company and from the ring [???] [???] rather on the valiant part
[???] had played in all their adventures . with the wolves of the wild [???] in
the snows under [???] [???] and in the mines of moria where [???] fell .
[???] was most moved by the story of the fight on the bridge .
` it must have irked [???] to run from [???] [???] ' he said [???] ` or even from
the fell thing you name [???] the balrog - - even though he was the last to
leave . '
` he was the last [???] ' said [???] [???] ' but [???] was forced to lead us . he
alone knew the way after [???] ' s fall . but had there not been us lesser
folk to care for [???] i do not think that either he or [???] would have fled . '
` maybe [???] it would have been better had [???] fallen ther e with
[???] [???] ' said [???] [???] ` and not gone on to the fate that waited above
the falls of [???] . '

' maybe . but tell me now of your own fortunes [???] ' said [???] [???] turning the
matter aside once again . ` for i would learn more of minas [???] and
[???] [???] and minas [???] the long - enduring . what hope have you for that
city in your long war ? '
' what hope have we ? ' said [???] . ' it is long since we had any hope .
the sword of [???] [???] if it returns indeed [???] may [???] it [???] but i do not
think that it will do more than put off the evil day [???] unless other help
[???] - for also comes [???] from elves or men . for the enemy increases and we
[???] . we are a failing people [???] a springless autumn .
` the men of n [???] menor were settled far and wide on the shores and seaward
regions of the great lands [???] but for the most part they fell into evils and
follies . many became [???] of the darkness and the black arts ; some
were
given over wholly to idleness and ease [???] and some fought among themselves [???]
until they were conquered in their weakness by the wild men .
` it is not said that evil arts were ever practised in [???] [???] or that
the nameless one was ever named in honour there ; and the old wisdom and
beauty brought out of the west remained long in the realm of the sons of
[???] the fair [???] and they linger there still . yet even so it was [???]
that brought about its own decay [???] falling by degrees into dotage [???] and
thinking that the enemy was asleep [???] who was only banished not destroyed .
' death was ever present [???] because the n [???] [???] still [???] as they had in
their old kingdom [???] and so lost it [???] hungered after endless life [???] .
kings made tombs more [???] than houses of the living . and counted old
names in the rolls of their descent dearer than the names of sons . childless
lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry ; in secret chambers withered men
compounded strong [???] [???] or in high cold towers asked questions of the
stars . and the last king of the line of [???] had no heir .
` but the stewards were wiser and more fortunate . wiser [???] for they
[???] the strength of our people from the [???] folk of the sea - coast [???]
and from the hardy [???] of ered [???] . and they made a truce with
the proud peoples of the north [???] who often had assailed us [???] men of fierce
valour [???] but our kin from afar off [???] unlike the wild [???] or the cruel
[???] .
' so it came to pass in the days of [???] the [???] steward ( and my
father is the sit and twentieth ) that they rode to our aid and at the great
field of celebrant they destroyed our enemies that had seized our northern

[???] . these are the [???] [???] as we name them [???] masters of horses [???] and
we ceded to them the fields of [???] that are since called [???] ; for
that province had long been [???] peopled . and they became our allies [???]
and have ever proved true to us [???] aiding us at need [???] and guarding our
northern marches and the gap of [???] .
` of our lore and manners they have learned what they would [???] and their
lords speak our speech at need ; yet for the most part they hold by the ways
of their own fathers and to their own memories [???] and they speak among
themselves their own north tongue . and we love them : tall men and fair
women [???] valiant both alike [???] golden - haired [???] bright - eyed [???] and strong ; they
remind us of the youth of men [???] as they were in the elder days . indeed it is
said by our lore - masters that they have from of old this [???] with us
that they are come from those same three houses of men as were the
n [???] [???] in their beginning not from hador the [???] [???] the
elf - friend [???] maybe [???] yet from such of his sons and people as went not over sea
into the west [???] refusing the call .
' for so we reckon men in our lore [???] calling them the high [???] or men of the
west [???] which were n [???] [???] ; and the middle peoples [???] men of the
[???] [???]
such as are the [???] and their kin that dwell still far in the north ;
and the wild [???] the men of darkness .
` yet now [???] if the [???] are grown in some ways more like to us [???]
[???] in arts and gentleness [???] we too have become more like to them [???] and
can scarce claim any longer the title high . we are become middle men [???] of the
[???] [???] but with memory of other things . for as the [???] do [???] we now
love war and valour as things good in themselves [???] both a sport and an end ;
and though we still hold that a warrior should have more skills and
knowledge than only the craft of weapons and slaying [???] we esteem a warrior [???]
nonetheless [???] above men of other crafts . such is the need of our days . so
even was my brother [???] [???] : a man of [???] [???] and for that he was
accounted the best man in [???] . and very valiant indeed he was : no heir of
minas [???] has for long years been so hardy in toil [???] so onward into
battle [???] or blown a mightier note on the great horn . ' [???] sighed and fell
silent for a while .
` you don ' t say much in all your tales about the elves [???] sir [???] ' said sam [???]
suddenly plucking up courage . he had noted that [???] seemed to refer to
elves with reverence [???] and this even more than his courtesy [???] and his food and

wine [???] had won sam ' s respect and quieted his suspicions .
` no indeed [???] master [???] [???] ' said [???] [???] ` for i am not learned in
elven - lore . but there you touch upon another point in which we have changed [???]
declining from n [???] menor to middle - earth . for as you may know [???] if
[???]
was your companion and you have spoken with [???] [???] the edain [???] the fathers
of the n [???] [???] [???] fought beside the elves in the first wars [???] and were
rewarded by the gift of the kingdom in the midst of the sea [???] within sight of
[???] . but in middle - earth men and elves became [???] in the days
of
darkness [???] by the arts of the enemy [???] and by the slow changes of time in which
each kind walked further down their sundered roads . men now fear and
[???] the elves [???] and yet know little of them . and we of [???] grow like
other men [???] like the men of [???] ; for even they [???] who are the foes of the
dark lord [???] shun the elves and speak of the golden wood with dread .
` yet there are among us still some who have dealings with the elves
when they may [???] and ever and anon one will go in secret to [???] [???] seldom to
return . not i . for i deem it perilous now for mortal man wilfully to seek
out the elder people . yet i envy you that have spoken with the white lady . '
` the lady of [???] ! [???] ! ' cried sam . ` you should see her indeed
you should [???] sir . i am only a hobbit [???] and gardening ' s my job at home [???] sir [???] if
you understand me [???] and i ' m not much good at poetry - - not at making it : a
bit of a comic rhyme [???] perhaps . now and again [???] you know [???] but not real poetry
- - so i can ' t tell you what i mean . it ought to be sung . you ' d have to get
strider [???] [???] that is [???] or old mr . [???] [???] for that . but i wish i could
make a song about her . beautiful she is [???] sir ! lovely ! sometimes like a great
tree in flower [???] sometimes like a white [???] [???] small and slender
like . hard as di ' monds [???] soft as moonlight . warm as sunlight [???] cold as frost
in the stars . proud and far - off as a snow - mountain [???] and as merry as any lass
i ever saw with [???] in her hair in [???] . but that ' s a lot o '
nonsense [???] and all wide of my mark . '
' then she must be lovely indeed [???] ' said [???] . ` perilously fair . '
` i don ' t know about perilous [???] ' said sam . ` it strikes me that folk takes
their peril with them into [???] [???] and finds it there because they ' ve
brought it . but perhaps you could call her perilous [???] because she ' s so strong
in herself . you [???] you could dash yourself to pieces on her [???] like a ship on a
rock ; or drownd yourself [???] like a hobbit in a river . but neither rock nor

river would be to blame . now boro - - ' he stopped and went red in the face .
` yes ? now [???] you would say ? ' said [???] . ` what would you say ?
he took his peril with him ? '
` yes sir [???] begging your pardon [???] and a fine man as your brother was if i
may say so . but you ' ve been warm on the scent all along . now i watched
[???] and listened to him [???] from [???] all down the road - - looking
after my master [???] as you ' ll understand [???] and not meaning any harm to [???]
- - and it ' s my opinion that in [???] he first saw clearly what i guessed
sooner : what he wanted . from the moment he first saw it he wanted the
enemy ' s ring ! '
` sam ! ' cried [???] [???] . he had fallen deep into his own thoughts
for a while [???] and came out of them suddenly and too late .
' save me ! ' said sam turning white [???] and then [???] scarlet . ` there i
go again ! when ever you open your big mouth you put your foot in it the
[???] used to say to me [???] and right enough . o dear [???] o dear !
` now look here [???] sir ! ' he turned [???] facing up to [???] with all the
courage that he could muster . ` don ' t you go taking advantage of my master
because his servant ' s no better than a fool . you ' ve spoken very handsome all
along [???] put me off my guard [???] talking of elves and all . but handsome is as
handsome does we say . now ' s a chance to show your quality . '
' so it seems [???] ' said [???] [???] slowly and very softly [???] with a strange
smile . ` so that is the answer to all the [???] ! the one ring that was
thought to have perished fr om the world . and [???] tried to take it by
force ? and you escaped ? and ran all the way - - to me ! and here in the wild i
have you : two halflings [???] and a host of men at my call [???] and the ring of
rings . a pretty stroke of fortune ! a chance for [???] [???] captain of [???] [???]
to show his quality ! ha ! ' he stood up [???] very tall and stern [???] his grey eyes
[???] .
[???] and sam sprang from their stools and set themselves side by side
with their backs to the wall [???] fumbling for their sword - [???] . there was a
silence . all the men in the cave stopped talking and looked towards them in
wonder . but [???] sat down again in his chair and began to laugh quietly [???]
and then suddenly became grave again .
' alas for [???] ! it was too sore a trial ! ' he said . ` how you have
increased my sorrow [???] you two strange wanderers from a far country [???] bearing
the peril of men ! but you are less judges of men than i of halflings . we are
truth - speakers [???] we men of [???] . we boast seldom [???] and then perform [???] or die

in the attempt . not if i found it on the highway would i take it i said .
even if i were such a man as to desire this thing [???] and even though i knew
not clearly what this thing was when i spoke [???] still i should take those
words as a vow [???] and be held by them .
' but i am not such a man . or i am wise enough to know that there are
some perils from which a man must flee . sit at peace ! and be comforted [???]
[???] . if you seem to have [???] [???] think that it was fated to be so .
your heart is shr ewd as well as faithful [???] and saw clearer than your eyes .
for strange though it may seem [???] it was safe to declare this to me . it may
even help the master that you love . it shall turn to his good [???] if it is in
my power . so be comforted . but do not even name this thing again aloud . once
is enough . '
the [???] came back to their seats and sat very quiet . men turned
back to their drink and their talk [???] perceiving that their captain had had
some jest or other with the little guests [???] and that it was over .
' well [???] [???] [???] now at last we understand one another [???] ' said [???] . ' if
you took this thing on yourself [???] unwilling [???] at others ' asking [???] then you have
pity and honour from me . and i marvel at you : to keep it hid and not to use
it . you are a new people and a new world to me . are all your kin of like
sort ? your land must be a realm of peace and content [???] and there must
gardeners be in high honour . '
` not all is well there [???] ' said [???] [???] ` but certainly gardeners are
honoured . '
` but folk must grow weary there [???] even in their gardens [???] as do all
things under the sun of this world . and you are far from home and [???] .
no more tonight . sleep [???] both of you - - in peace [???] if you can . fear not ! i do
not wish to see it [???] or touch it [???] or know more of it than i know ( which is
enough ) [???] lest peril perchance waylay me and i fall lower in the test than
[???] son of drogo . go now to rest - - but first tell me only [???] if you will [???]
whither you wish to go [???] and what to do . for i must watch [???] and wait [???] and
think . time passes . in the morning we must each go swiftly on the ways
appointed to us . '
[???] had felt himself trembling as the first shock of fear passed . now
a great weariness came down on him like a cloud . he could dissemble and
resist no longer .
' i was going to find a way into [???] [???] ' he said faintly . ` i was going
to [???] . i must find the mountain of fire and cast the thing into the

gulf of doom . [???] said so . i do not think i shall ever get there . '
[???] stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment . then suddenly
he caught him as he swayed [???] and lifting him gently [???] carried him to the bed
and laid him there [???] and covered him warmly . at once he fell into a deep
sleep .
another bed was set beside him for his servant . sam [???] for a
moment [???] then bowing very low : ` good night [???] captain [???] my lord [???] ' he said . ` you
took the chance [???] sir . '
` did i so ? ' said [???] .
` yes sir [???] and showed your quality : the very highest . '
[???] smiled . ' a pert servant [???] master [???] . but nay : the praise of
the [???] is above all rewards . yet there was naught in this to
praise . i had no lure or desire to do other than i have done . '
` ah well [???] sir [???] ' said sam [???] ` you said my master had an elvish air and
that was good and true . but i can say this : you have an air too [???] sir [???] that
reminds me of [???] of - - well [???] [???] [???] of [???] .
' maybe [???] ' said [???] . ` maybe you discern from far away the air of
n [???] menor . good n ight ! '




chapter 6 . the forbidden pool



[???] woke to find [???] bending over him . for a second old fears
seized him and he sat up and shrank away .
` there is nothing to fear [???] ' said [???] .
' is it morning already ? ' said [???] yawning .
` not yet [???] but night is drawing to an end [???] and the full moon is setting .
will you come and see it ? also there is a matter on which i desire your
counsel . i am sorry to rouse you from sleep [???] but will you come ? '
` i will [???] ' said [???] [???] rising and shivering a little as he left the warm
blanket and pelts . it seemed cold in the fireless cave . the noise of the
water was loud in the stillness . he put on his cloak and followed [???] .
sam [???] waking suddenly by some instinct of watchfulness [???] saw first his
master ' s empty bed and leapt to his feet . then he saw two dark figures [???]
[???] and a man [???] framed against the archway [???] which was now filled with a
pale white light . he hurried after them [???] past rows of men sleeping on
[???] along the wall . as he went by the cave - mouth he saw that the
curtain was now become a [???] veil of silk and pearls and silver thread :
melting [???] of moonlight . but he did not pause to admire it [???] and turning
aside he followed his master thr [???] the narrow doorway in the wall of the
cave .
they went first along a black passage [???] then up many wet steps [???] and so
came to a small flat landing cut in the stone and lit by the pale sky [???]
gleaming high above through a long deep shaft . from here two flights of
steps led : one going on [???] as it seemed [???] up on to the high bank of the stream ;
the other turning away to the left . this they followed . it wound its way up
like a turret - stair .
at last they came out of the stony darkness and looked about . they were
on a wide flat rock without rail or [???] . at their right [???] eastwards [???] the
torrent fell [???] [???] over many terraces [???] and then [???] pouring down a steep
race [???] it filled a smooth - hewn channel with a dark force of water flecked
with foam [???] and curling and rushing almost at their feet it [???] sheer
over the edge that yawned upon their left . a man stood there [???] near the
brink [???] silent [???] gazing down .
[???] turned to watch the sleek necks of the water as they curved and

dived . then he lifted his eyes and gazed far away . the world was quiet and
cold [???] as if dawn were near . far off in the west the full moon was sinking [???]
round and white . pale mists [???] in the great vale below : a wide gulf
of silver fume [???] beneath which rolled the cool night - waters of the [???] . a
black darkness loomed beyond [???] and in it glinted [???] here and there [???] cold [???]
sharp [???] remote [???] white as the teeth of ghosts [???] the peaks of ered [???] [???] the
white mountains of the realm of [???] [???] tipped with everlasting snow .
for a while [???] stood there on the high stone [???] and a shiver ran
through him [???] wondering if anywhere in the vastness of the night - lands his
old companions walked or slept [???] or lay dead shrouded in mist . why was he
brough t here out of forgetful sleep ?
sam was eager for an answer to the same question and could not refrain
himself from muttering [???] for his master ' s ear alone as he thought : ' it ' s a
fine view [???] no doubt [???] mr . [???] [???] but chilly to the heart [???] not to mention the
bones ! what ' s going on ? '
[???] heard and answered . ` moonset over [???] . fair [???] as he goes
from middle - earth [???] glances upon the white locks of old [???] . it is
worth a few shivers . but that is not what i brought you to see - though as for
you [???] [???] [???] you were not brought [???] and do but pay the penalty of your
watchfulness . a draught of wine shall amend it . come [???] look now ! '
he stepped up beside the silent [???] on the dark edge . and [???]
followed . sam hung back . he already felt [???] enough on this high wet
platform . [???] and [???] looked down . far below them they saw the white
waters pour into a foaming bowl [???] and then [???] darkly about a deep oval
basin in the rocks . until they found their way out again through a narrow
gate [???] and flowed away [???] [???] and chattering [???] into calmer and more level
reaches . the moonlight still [???] down to the fall ' s foot and gleamed on
the ripples of the basin . presently [???] was aware of a small dark thing on
the near bank [???] but even as he looked at it [???] it dived and vanished just
beyond the boil and bubble of the fall [???] cleaving the black water as neatly
as an arrow or an edgewise stone .
[???] turned to the man at his side . ` now what would you say that it
is [???] anborn ? a [???] [???] or a [???] ? are there black [???] in the
night - [???] of [???] ? '
` ' tis not a bird [???] whatever else it be [???] ' answered anborn . ` it has four
limbs and dives manwise ; a pretty mastery of the craft it shows [???] too . what
is it at ? seeking a way up behind the curtain to our hidings ? it seems we

are discovered at last . i have my bow here [???] and i have posted other archers [???]
nigh as good marksmen as myself [???] on either bank . we wait only for your
command to shoot [???] captain . '
` shall we shoot ? ' said [???] [???] turning quickly to [???] .
[???] did not answer for a moment . then ` no ! ' he said . ` no ! i beg you
not to . ' if sam had dared [???] he would have said ` yes [???] ' quicker and louder . he
could not see [???] but he guessed well enough from their words what they were
looking at .
' you know [???] then [???] what this thing is ? ' said [???] . ` come [???] now you
have seen [???] tell me why it should be spared . in all our words together you
have not once spoken of your [???] companion [???] and i let him be for the
time . he could wait till he was caught and brought before me . i sent my
keenest huntsmen to seek him [???] but he slipped them [???] and they had no sight of
him till now [???] save anborn here [???] once at [???] [???] . but now he has
done worse trespass than only to go coney - snaring in the [???] : he has
dared to come to [???] annyn [???] and his life is forfeit . i marvel at the
creature : so secret and so sly as he is [???] to come sporting in the pool before
our very window . does he think that men sleep without watch all night ? why
does he so ? '
' there are two answers [???] i think [???] ' said [???] . ` for one thing [???] he knows
little of men [???] and sly though he is [???] your [???] is so hidden that perhaps
he does not know that men are concealed here . for another [???] i think he is
allured here by a mastering desire [???] stronger than his caution . '
` he is lured here [???] you say ? ' said [???] in a low voice . ` can he [???]
does he then know of your burden ? '
` indeed yes . he bore it himself for many years . '
' he bore it ? ' said [???] [???] breathing sharply in his wonder . ` this
matter winds itself ever in new [???] . then he is pursuing it ? '
' maybe . it is precious to him . but i did not speak of that . '
` what then does the creature seek ? '
` fish [???] ' said [???] . ` look ! '
they peered down at the dark pool . a little black head appeared at the
far end of the basin [???] just out of the deep shadow of the rocks . there was a
brief silver glint [???] and a [???] of tiny ripples . it swam to the side [???] and
then with marvellous agility a [???] figure climbed out of the water and
up the bank . at once it sat down and began to gnaw at the small silver thing
that glittered as it turned : the last rays of the moon were now falling

behind the stony wall at the pool ' s end .
[???] laughed softly . ` fish ! ' he said . ` it is a less perilous
hunger . or maybe not : fish from the pool of [???] annyn may cost him all
he has to give . '
` now i have him at the arrow - point [???] ' said anborn . ` shall i not shoot [???]
captain ? for coming [???] to this place death is our law . '
` wait [???] anborn [???] ' said [???] . ` this is a harder matter than it seems .
what have you to say now [???] [???] ? why should we spare ? '
` the creature is wretched and hungry [???] ' said [???] [???] ` and [???] of his
danger . and [???] [???] your [???] [???] he would have bidden you not to slay
him for that reason [???] and for others . he forbade the elves to do so . i do not
know clearly why [???] and of what i guess i cannot speak openly out here . but
this creature is in some way bound up with my errand . until you found us and
took us [???] he was my guide . '
` your guide ! ' said [???] . ` the matter becomes ever stranger . i would
do much for you [???] [???] [???] but this i cannot grant : to let this sly wanderer go
free at his own will from here [???] to join you later if it please him [???] or to be
caught by [???] and tell all he knows under threat of pain . he must be slain
or taken . slain [???] if he be not taken very swiftly . but how can this slippery
thing of many guises be caught [???] save by a feathered shaft ? '
` let me go down quietly to him [???] ' said [???] . ` you may keep your bows
bent [???] and shoot me at least [???] if i fail . i shall not run away . '
` go then and be swift ! ' said [???] . ` if he comes off alive [???] he
should be your faithful servant for the rest of his unhappy days . lead [???]
down to the bank [???] anborn [???] and go softly . the thing has a nose and ears . give
me your bow . '
anborn [???] and led the way down the winding sta ir to the landing [???]
and then up the other stair [???] until at last they came to a narrow opening
shrouded with thick bushes . passing silently through [???] [???] found himself on
the top of the southern bank above the pool . it was now dark and the falls
were pale and grey [???] reflecting only the lingering moonlight of the western
sky . he could not see [???] . he went forward a short way and anborn
came
softly behind him .
` go on ! ' he breathed in [???] ' s ear . ` have a care to your right . if
you fall in the pool [???] then no one but your fishing friend can help you . and
forget not that there are bowmen near at hand [???] though you may not see them . '

[???] crept forward [???] using his hands [???] - like to feel his way and to
steady himself . the rocks were for the most part flat and smooth but
slippery . he halted listening . at first he could hear no sound but the
[???] rush of the fall behind him . then presently he heard [???] not far
ahead [???] a hissing murmur .
' [???] [???] nice [???] . white face has vanished [???] my precious [???] at last [???] yes .
now we can eat fish in peace . no [???] not in peace [???] precious . for precious is
lost ; yes [???] lost . dirty [???] [???] [???] [???] . gone and left us [???] [???] ; and
precious is gone . only poor [???] all alone . no [???] s . [???] men [???]
they ' ll take it [???] steal my precious . thieves . we hates them . [???] [???] nice
[???] : makes us strong . makes eyes bright [???] fingers tight [???] yes . [???]
them [???] precious . [???] them all [???] yes [???] if we gets chances . nice [???] . nice
[???] ! '
so it went on [???] almost as [???] as the waterfall [???] only interrupted
by a faint noise of slavering and [???] . [???] shivered [???] listening with
pity and disgust . he wished it would stop [???] and that he never need hear that
voice again . anborn was not far behind . he could creep back and ask him to
get the huntsmen to shoot . they would probably get close enough [???] while
[???] was [???] and off his guard . only one true shot [???] and [???] would be
rid of the miserable voice for ever . but no [???] [???] had a claim on him now .
the servant has a claim on the master for service [???] even service in fear .
they would have foundered in the dead marshes but for [???] . [???]
knew [???]
too [???] somehow [???] quite clearly that [???] would not have wished it .
` [???] ! ' he said softly .
` [???] [???] nice [???] [???] ' said the voice .
` [???] ! ' he said [???] a little louder . the voice stopped .
` [???] [???] master has come to look for you . master is here . come [???]
[???] ! ' there was no answer but a soft hiss [???] as of intaken breath .
' come [???] [???] ! ' said [???] . ` we are in danger . men will kill you [???] if
they find you here . come quickly [???] if you wish to escape death . come to
master ! '
' no ! ' said the voice . ` not nice master . leaves poor [???] and goes
with new friends . master can wait . [???] hasn ' t finished . '
` there ' s no time [???] ' said [???] . ` bring fish with you . come ! '
` no ! must finish fish . '
' [???] ! ' said [???] desperately . ' precious will be angry . i shall

take precious [???] and i shall say : make him swallow the bones and choke . never
taste fish again . come [???] precious is waiting ! '
there was a sharp hiss . presently out of the darkness [???] came
[???] on all fours [???] like an erring dog called to heel . he had a
half - eaten fish in his mouth and another in his hand . he came close to
[???] [???] almost nose to nose [???] and [???] at him . his pale eyes were shining .
then he took the fish out of his mouth and stood up .
` nice master ! ' he whispered . ` nice hobb it [???] come back to poor [???] .
good [???] comes . now let ' s go [???] go quickly [???] yes . through the trees [???] while
the faces are dark . yes [???] come let ' s go ! '
` yes [???] we ' ll go soon [???] ' said [???] . ` but not at once . i will go with you
as i promised . i promise aga in . but not now . you are not safe yet . i will
save you [???] but you must trust me . '
` we must trust master ? ' said [???] doubtfully . ' why ? why not go at
once ? where is the other one [???] the cross rude hobbit ? where is he ? '
' away up there [???] ' said [???] [???] pointing to the waterfall . ' i am not going
without him . we must go back to him . ' his heart sank . this was too much like
trickery . he did not really fear that [???] would allow [???] to be
killed [???] but he would probably make him prisoner and bind him ; and certainly
what [???] did would seem a treachery to the poor treacherous creature . it
would probably be impossible ever to make him understand or believe that
[???] had saved his life in the only way he could . what else could he do ? - -
to keep faith [???] as near as might be [???] with both sides . ` come ! ' he said . ` or
the precious will be angry . we are going back now [???] up the stream . go on [???] go
on [???] you go in front ! '
[???] [???] along close to the brink for a little way [???] snuffling and
suspicious . presently he stopped and raised his head . ` something ' s there ! '
he said . ` not a hobbit . ' suddenly he turned back . a green light was
[???] in his bulging eyes . ` masster [???] masster ! ' he [???] . ' wicked !
tricksy ! false ! ' he spat and stretched out his long arms with white snapping
fingers .
at that moment the great black shape of anborn loomed up behind him and
came down on him . a large strong hand took him in the nape of the neck and
pinned him . he twisted round like lightning [???] all wet and [???] as he was [???]
[???] like an eel [???] biting and scratching like a cat . but two more men
came up out of the shadows .
' hold still ! ' said one . ` or we ' ll stick you as full of pins as a

[???] . hold still ! '
[???] went limp [???] and began to whine and weep . they tied him [???] none too
gently .
` easy [???] easy ! ' said [???] . ` he has no strength to match you . don ' t hurt
him [???] if you can help it . he ' ll be quieter [???] if you don ' t . [???] ! they won ' t
hurt you . i ' ll go with you [???] and you shall come to no harm . not unless they
kill me too . trust master ! '
[???] turned and spat at him . the men picked him up [???] put a hood over
his eyes [???] and carried him off .
[???] followed them [???] feeling very wretched . they went through the
opening behind the bushes . and back [???] down the stairs and passages [???] into the
cave . two or three torches had been lit . men were stirring . sam was there [???]
and he gave a queer look at the limp bundle that the men carried . ` got him ? '
he said to [???] .
' yes . well no [???] i didn ' t get him . he came to me [???] because he trusted me
at first [???] i ' m afraid . i did not want him tied up like this . i hope it will
be all right ; but i hate the whole business . '
` so do i [???] ' said sam . ` and nothing will ever be all right where that
piece of misery is . '
a man came and beckoned to the [???] [???] and took them to the recess at
the back of the cave . [???] was sitting there in his chair [???] and the lamp
had been [???] in its niche above his head . he signed to them to sit
down on the stools beside him . ` bring wine for the guests [???] ' he said . ` and
bring the prisoner to me . '
the wine was brought [???] and then anborn came carrying [???] . he
removed
the cover from [???] ' s head and set him on his feet standing behind him to
support him . [???] [???] [???] hooding the malice of his eyes with their heavy
pale lids . a very miserable creature he looked [???] dripping and dank [???] smelling
of fish ( he still clutched one in his hand ) ; his sparse locks were hanging
like rank weed over his bony brows [???] his nose was [???] .
` loose us ! loose us ! ' he said . ` the cord hurts us [???] yes it does [???] it
hurts us [???] and we ' ve done nothing . '
` nothing ? ' said [???] [???] looking at the wretched creature with a keen
glance [???] but without any expression in his face either of anger [???] or pity [???] or
wonder . ' nothing ? have you never done anything worthy of binding or of
worse

punishment ? however [???] that is not for me to judge [???] happily . but tonight you
have come where it is death to come . the fish of this pool are dearly
bought . '
[???] dropped the fish from his hand . ` don ' t want fish [???] ' he said .
' the price is not set on the fish [???] ' said [???] . ` only to come here
and look on the pool bears the penalty of death . i have spared you so far at
the prayer of [???] here [???] who says that of him at least you have deserved
some thanks . but you must also satisfy me . what is your name ? whence do
you
come ? and whither do you go ? what is your business ? '
` we are lost [???] lost [???] ' said [???] . ' no name [???] no business [???] no precious [???]
nothing . only empty . only hungry ; yes [???] we are hungry . a few little fishes [???]
[???] bony little fishes [???] for a poor creature [???] and they say death . so wise
they are ; so just [???] so very just . '
' not very wise [???] ' said [???] . ' but just : yes perhaps [???] as just as our
little wisdom allows . unloose him [???] ! ' [???] took a small nail - knife
from his belt and handed it to [???] . [???] [???] the gesture [???]
[???] and fell down .
' now [???] [???] ! ' said [???] . ' you must trust me . i will not desert you .
answer truthfully [???] if you can . it will do you good not harm . ' he cut the
cords on [???] ' s wrists and ankles and raised him to his feet .
' come hither ! ' said [???] . ` look at me ! do you know the name of this
place ? have you been here before ? '
slowly [???] raised his eyes and looked unwillingly into [???] ' s .
all light went out of them [???] and they stared bleak and pale for a moment into
the clear [???] eyes of the man of [???] . there was a still silence .
then [???] dropped his head and shrank down [???] until he was [???] on the
floor [???] shivering . ' we doesn ' t know and we doesn ' t want to know [???] ' he
[???] . ` never came here ; never come again . '
` there are locked doors and closed windows in your mind [???] and dark rooms
behind them [???] ' said [???] . ` but in this i judge that you speak the truth .
it is well for you . what oath will you swear never to return ; and never to
lead any living creature hither by word or sign ? '
` master knows [???] ' said [???] with a sidelong glance at [???] . ` yes [???] he
knows . we will promise master [???] if he saves us . we ' ll promise to it [???] yes . ' he
[???] to [???] ' s feet . ' save us [???] nice master ! ' he whined . ` [???]
promises to precious [???] promises faithfully . never come again [???] never speak [???] no

never ! no [???] precious [???] no ! '
` are you satisfied ? ' said [???] .
` yes [???] ' said [???] . ' at least [???] you must either accept this promise or
carry out your law . you will get no more . but i promised that if he came to
me [???] he should not be harmed . and i would not be proved faithless . '
[???] sat for a moment in thought . ` very good [???] ' he said at last . ` i
[???] you to your master [???] to [???] son of drogo . let him declare what he
will do with you ! '
' but [???] lord [???] [???] ' said [???] bowing [???] ` you have not yet declared your
will concerning the said [???] [???] and until that is made known [???] he cannot
shape his plans for himself or his companions . your judgement was [???]
until the morning ; but that is now at hand . '
` then i will declare my doom [???] ' said [???] . ` as for you [???] [???] [???] in so
far as lies in me under higher authority [???] i declare you free in the realm
of [???] [???] to the furthest of its ancient bounds ; save only that neither you
nor any that go with you have leave to come to this place [???] . this
doom shall stand for a year and a day [???] and then cease [???] unless you shall
before that term come to minas [???] and present yourself to the lord and
steward of the city . then i will entreat him to confirm what i have done and
to make it lifelong . in the meantime [???] whomsoever you take under your
protection shall be under my protection and under the shield of [???] . are
you answered ? '
[???] bowed low . ' i am answered [???] ' he said [???] ` and i place myself at your
service [???] if that is of any worth to one so high and honourable . '
` it is of great worth [???] ' said [???] . ' and now [???] do you take this
creature [???] this [???] [???] under your protection ? '
` i do take [???] under my protection [???] ' said [???] . sam sighed
audibly ; and not at the courtesies [???] of which [???] as any hobbit would [???] he
thoroughly approved . indeed in the shire such a matter would have required a
great many more words and bows .
' then i say to you [???] ' said [???] [???] turning to [???] [???] ' you are under
doom of death ; but while you walk with [???] you are safe for our part . yet
if ever you be found by any man of [???] [???] without him [???] the doom shall
fall . and may death find you swiftly [???] within [???] or without [???] if you do
not well serve him . now answer me : whither would you go ? you were his
guide [???]
he says . whither were you leading him ? ' [???] made no reply .

` this i will not have secret [???] ' said [???] . ` answer me [???] or i will
reverse my judgement ! ' still [???] did not answer .
` i will answer for him [???] ' said [???] . ` he brought me to the black gate [???]
as i asked ; but it was [???] . '
` there is no open gate into the nameless land [???] ' said [???] .
` seeing this [???] we turned aside and came by the southward road ' [???]
continued ; ' for he said that there is [???] or there may be [???] a path near to minas
[???] . '
` minas [???] [???] ' said [???] .
` i do not know clearly [???] ' said [???] ; ` but the path climbs [???] i think [???] up
into the mountains on the northern side of that vale where the old city
stands . it goes up to a high cleft and so down to - - that which is beyond . '
` do you know the name of that high pass ? ' said [???] .
' no [???] ' said [???] .
' it is called [???] ungol . ' [???] [???] sharply and began muttering
to himself . ` is not that its name ? ' said [???] turning to him .
` no ! ' said [???] [???] and then he [???] [???] as if something had stabbed
him . ' yes [???] yes [???] we heard the name once . but what does the name matter to us ?
master says he must get in . so we must try some way . there is no other way
to try [???] no . '
' no other way ? ' said [???] . ` how do you know that ? and who has
explored all the confines of that dark realm ? ' he looked long and
thoughtfully at [???] . presently he spoke again . ` take this creature away [???]
anborn . treat him gently [???] but watch him . and do not you [???] [???] [???] try to
dive into the falls . the rocks have such teeth there as would slay you
before your time . leave us now and take your fish ! '
anborn went out and [???] went [???] before him . the curtain was
drawn across the recess .
` [???] [???] i think you do very [???] in this [???] ' said [???] . ` i do not
think you should go with this creature . it is wicked . '
' no [???] not altogether wicked [???] ' said [???] .
' not wholly [???] perhaps [???] ' said [???] ; ' but malice eats it like a canker [???]
and the evil is growing . he will lead you to no good . if you will part with
him [???] i will give him safe - conduct and [???] to any point on the borders
of [???] that he may name . '
` he would not take it [???] ' said [???] . ' he would follow after me as he
long has done . and i have promised many times to take him under my

protection and to go where he led . you would not ask me to break faith with
him ? '
' no [???] ' said [???] . ` but my heart would . for it seems less evil to
counsel another man to break troth than to do so oneself [???] especially if one
sees a friend bound unwitting to his own harm . but no - - if he will go with
you [???] you must now endure him . but i do not think you are holden to go to
[???] ungol [???] of which he has told you less than he knows . that much i
perceived clearly in his mind . do not go to [???] ungol ! '
` where then shall i go ? ' said [???] . ` back to the black gate and
deliver myself up to the guard ? what do you know against this place that
makes its name so dreadful ? '
` nothing certain [???] ' said [???] . ' we of [???] do not ever pass east of
the road in these days [???] and none of us younger men has ever done so [???] nor has
any of us set foot upon the mountains of shadow . of them we know only old
report and the rumour of [???] days . but there is some dark terror that
dwells in the passes above minas [???] . if [???] ungol is named [???] old men
and masters of lore will blanch and fall silent .
[???] the valley of minas [???] passed into evil very long ago [???] and it was
a menace and a dread while the banished enemy dwelt yet far away [???] and
[???] was still for the most par t in our keeping . as you know [???] that city
was once a strong place [???] proud and fair [???] minas [???] [???] the twin sister of our
own city . but it was taken by fell men whom the enemy in his first strength
had dominated [???] and who wandered homeless and masterless aft er his fall . it
is said that their lords were men of n [???] menor who had fallen into dark
wickedness ; to them the enemy had given rings of power [???] and he had
devoured
them : living ghosts they were become [???] terrible and evil . after his going
they took minas [???] and dwelt there [???] and they filled it [???] and all the
valley about [???] with decay : it seemed empty and was not so [???] for a shapeless
fear lived within the ruined walls . nine lords there were [???] and after the
return of their master [???] which they aided and prepared in secret [???] they grew
strong again . then the nine riders issued forth from the gates of horror [???]
and we could not withstand them . do not approach their [???] . you will be
espied . it is a place of sleepless malice [???] full of [???] eyes . do not go
that way ! '
' but where else will you direct me ? ' said [???] . ' you cannot yourself [???]
you say [???] guide me to the mountains [???] nor over them . but over the mountains i

am bound [???] by solemn undertaking to the council [???] to find a way or perish in
the seeking . and if i turn back [???] refusing the road in its bitter end [???] where
then shall i go among elves or men ? would you have me come to [???]
with
this thing [???] the thing that drove your brother mad with desire ? what spell
would it work in minas [???] ? shall there be two cities of minas [???] [???]
grinning at each other across a dead land filled with rottenness ? '
` i would not have it so [???] ' said [???] .
` then what would you have me do ? '
` i know not . only i would not have you go to death or to torment . and i
do not think that [???] would have chosen this way . '
' yet since he is gone [???] i must take such paths as i can find . and there
is no time for long searching [???] ' said [???] .
` it is a hard doom and a hopeless errand [???] ' said [???] . ' but at the
least [???] remember my warning : beware of this guide [???] [???] . he has done
murder before now . i read it in him . ' he sighed .
` well [???] so we meet and part [???] [???] son of drogo . you have no need of
soft words : i do not hope to see you again on any other day under this sun .
but you shall go now with my blessing upon you [???] and upon all your people .
rest a little while food is prepared for you .
' i would gladly learn how this creeping [???] became possessed of the
thing of which we speak [???] and how he lost it [???] but i will not trouble you now .
if ever beyond hope you return to the lands of the living and we retell our
tales [???] sitting by a wall in the sun [???] laughing at old grief [???] you shall tell
me then . until that time [???] or some other time beyond the vision of the
seeing - stones of n [???] menor [???] farewell ! '
he rose and bowed low to [???] [???] and drawing the curtain passed out into
the cave .




chapter 7 . journey to the cross - roads



[???] and sam returned to their beds and lay there in silence resting
for a little [???] while men [???] themselves and the business of the day
began . after a while water was brought to them [???] and then they were led to a
table where food was set for three . [???] broke his fast with them . he had
not slept since the battle on the day before [???] yet he did not look weary .
when they had finished they stood up . ` may no hunger trouble you on the
road [???] ' said [???] . ` you have little provision [???] but some small store of
food fit for travellers i have ordered to be stowed in your packs . you will
have no lack of water as you walk in [???] [???] but do not drink of any
stream that flows from [???] [???] [???] the valley of living death . this also i
must tell you . my scouts and watchers have all returned [???] even some that have
crept within sight of the [???] . they all find a strange thing . the land
is empty . nothing is on the road [???] and no sound of foot [???] or horn [???] or
[???] is anywhere to be heard . a waiting silence broods above the
nameless land . i do not know what this [???] . but the time draws swiftly
to some great conclusion . storm is coming . hasten while you may ! if you are
ready [???] let us go . the sun will soon rise above the shadow . '
the [???] ' packs were brought to them ( a little heavier than they had
been ) [???] and also two stout staves of polished wood [???] shod with iron [???] and with
carven heads through which ran [???] leathern [???] .
' i have no fitting gifts to give you at our parting [???] ' said [???] ;
` but take these staves . they may be of service to those who walk or climb in
the wild . the men of the white mountains use them ; though these have been
cut down to your height and newly shod . they are made of the fair tree
[???] [???] beloved of the [???] of [???] [???] and a virtue has been set
upon them of finding and returning . may that virtue not wholly fail under
the shadow into which you go ! '
the [???] bowed low . ` most gracious host [???] ' said [???] [???] ' it was said
to me by [???] [???] that i should find friendship upon the way [???] secret
and [???] for . certainly i looked for no such friendship as you have
shown . to have found it turns evil to great good . '
now they made ready to depart . [???] was brought out of some corner or
hiding - hole [???] and he seemed better pleased with himself than he had been [???]

though he kept close to [???] and avoided the glance of [???] .
' your guide must be [???] [???] ' said [???] [???] ' but you and your
servant [???] i release from this [???] if you wish . '
[???] [???] [???] and [???] [???] and clutched at [???] [???] when they came to
bind his eyes ; and [???] said : ' blindfold us all three [???] and cover up my eyes
first [???] and then perhaps he will see that no harm is meant . ' this was done [???]
and they were led from the cave of [???] annyn . after they had passed the
passages and stairs they felt the cool morning air [???] fresh and sweet [???] about
them . still blind they went on for some little time [???] up and then gently
down . at last the voice of [???] ordered them to be uncovered .
they stood under the boughs of the woods again . no noise of the falls
could be heard [???] for a long southward slope lay now between them and the
ravine in which the stream flowed . to the west they could see light through
the trees [???] as if the world came there to a sudden end [???] at a brink looking
out only on to sky .
' here is the last parting of our ways [???] ' said [???] . ' if you take my
counsel [???] you will not turn eastward yet . go straight on [???] for thus you will
have the cover of the woodland for many miles . on your west is an edge where
the land falls into the great vales [???] sometimes suddenly and sheer [???] sometimes
in long hillsides . keep near to this edge and the skirts of the forest . in
the beginning of your journey you may walk under daylight [???] i think . the land
dreams in a false peace [???] and for a while all evil is withdrawn . fare you
well [???] while you may ! '
he embraced the [???] then [???] after the manner of his people [???] stooping [???]
and placing his hands upon their shoulders [???] and kissing their foreheads . ' go
with the good will of all good men ! ' he said .
they bowed to the ground . then he turned and without looking back he
left them and went to his two guards that stood at a little distance away .
they marvelled to see with what speed these green - clad men now moved [???]
vanishing almost in the [???] of an eye . the forest where [???] had
stood seemed empty and drear [???] as if a dream had passed .
[???] sighed and turned back southward . as if to mark his [???] of
all such courtesy [???] [???] was [???] in the mould at the foot of a tree .
` hungry again already ? ' thought sam . ` well [???] now for it again ! '
' have they gone at last ? ' said [???] . ` [???] wicked men ! [???] ' s
neck still hurts him [???] yes it does . let ' s go ! '
` yes [???] let us go [???] ' said [???] . ` but if you can only speak ill of those

who showed you mercy [???] keep silent ! '
` nice master ! ' said [???] . ` [???] was only joking . always forgives [???]
he does [???] yes [???] yes [???] even nice master ' s little trickses . oh yes [???] nice master [???]
nice [???] ! '
[???] and sam did not answer . hoisting their packs and taking their
staves in hand [???] they passed on into the woods of [???] .
twice that day they rested and took a little of the food provided by
[???] : dried fruits and salted meat [???] enough for many days ; and bread
enough to last while it was still fresh . [???] ate nothing .
the sun rose and passed overhead unseen [???] and began to sink [???] and the
light through the trees to the west grew golden ; and always they walked in
cool green shadow [???] and all about them was silence . the birds seemed all to
have flown away or to have fallen dumb .
darkness came early to the silent woods [???] and before the fall of night
they halted [???] weary [???] for they had walked seven leagues or more from [???]
annyn . [???] lay and slept away the night on the deep mould beneath an
ancient tree . sam beside him was more uneasy : he woke many times [???] but there
was never a sign of [???] [???] who had slipped off as soon as the others had
settled to rest . whether he had slept by himself in some hole nearby [???] or had
wandered restlessly [???] through the night [???] he did not say ; but he
returned with the first glimmer of light [???] and roused his companions .
` must get up [???] yes they must ! ' he said . ' long ways to go still [???] south
and east . [???] must make haste ! '
that day passed much as the day before had gone [???] except that the
silence seemed deeper ; the air grew heavy [???] and it began to be [???] under
the trees . it felt as if thunder was brewing . [???] often paused [???] [???]
the air [???] and then he would mutter to himself and urge them to greater speed .
as the third stage of their day ' s march drew on and afternoon wa ned [???]
the forest opened out [???] and the trees became larger and more scattered . great
[???] of huge girth stood dark and solemn in wide glades with here and
there among them hoary ash - trees . and giant oaks just putting out their
brown - green buds . about them lay long [???] of green grass [???] with
[???] and [???] [???] white and blue [???] now folded for sleep ; and there were
acres populous with the leaves of woodland [???] : already their sleek
bell - stems were thrusting through the mould . no living creature [???] beast or
bird [???] was to be seen [???] but in these open places [???] grew afraid [???] and they
walked now with caution [???] flitting from one long shadow to another .

light was fading fast when they came to the forest - end . there they sat
under an old [???] oak that sent its roots twisting like snakes down a
steep crumbling bank . a deep dim valley lay before them . on its further side
the woods gathered again [???] blue and grey under the sullen evening [???] and
marched on southwards . to the right the mountains of [???] glowed [???]
remote
in the west [???] under a fire - flecked sky . to the left lay darkness : the
towering walls of [???] ; and out of that darkness the long valley came [???]
falling steeply in an ever - widening trough towards the [???] . at its bottom
ran a hurrying stream : [???] could hear its stony voice coming up through
the silence ; and beside it on the hither side a road went winding down like
a pale ribbon [???] down into chill grey mists that no gleam of sunset touched .
there it seemed to [???] that he descried far off [???] floating as it were on a
shadowy sea [???] the high dim tops and broken [???] of old towers forlorn
and dark .
he turned to [???] . ` do you know where we are ? ' he said .
' yes [???] master . dangerous places . this is the road from the tower of the
moon [???] master [???] down to the ruined city by the shores of the river . the ruined
city [???] yes [???] very [???] place [???] full of enemies . we shouldn ' t have taken men ' s
advice . [???] have come a long way out of the path . must go east now [???] away
up there . ' he waved his skinny arm towards the darkling mountains . ` and we
can ' t use this road . oh no ! cruel peoples come this way [???] down from the
tower . '
[???] looked down on to the road . at any rate nothing was moving on it
now . it appeared lonely and forsaken [???] running down to empty ruins in the
mist . but there was an evil feeling in the air [???] as if things might indeed be
passing up and down that eyes could not see . [???] [???] as he looked
again at the distant [???] now [???] into night [???] and the sound of
the water seemed cold and cruel : the voice of [???] [???] the polluted
stream that flowed from the valley of the [???] .
' what shall we do ? ' he said . ' we have walked long and far . shall we
look for some place in the woods behind where we can lie hidden ? '
' no good hiding in the dark [???] ' said [???] . ' it ' s in day that [???]
must hide now [???] yes in day . '
` oh come ! ' said sam . ' we must rest for a bit [???] even if we get up again
in the middle of the night . there ' ll still be hours of dark then time enough
for you to take us a long march [???] if you know the way . '

[???] [???] agreed to this [???] and he turned back towards the
trees [???] working eastward for a while along the [???] edges of the wood .
he would not rest on the ground so near the evil road [???] and after some debate
they all climbed up into the [???] of a large holm - oak [???] whose thick
branches springing together from the trunk made a good hiding - place and a
fairly comfortable [???] . night fell and it grew altogether dark under the
canopy of the tree . [???] and sam drank a little water and ate some bread
and dried fruit [???] but [???] at once curled up and went to sleep . the [???]
did not shut their eyes .
it must have been a little after midnight when [???] woke up : suddenly
they were aware of his pale eyes [???] gleaming at them . he listened and
[???] [???] which seemed [???] as they had noticed before [???] his usual method of
discovering the time of night .
' are we rested ? have we had beautiful sleep ? ' he said . ' let ' s go ! '
' we aren ' t [???] and we haven ' t [???] ' growled sam . ' but we ' ll go if we must . '
[???] dropped at once from the branches of the tree on to all fours [???]
and the [???] followed more slowly .
as soon as they were down they went on again with [???] leading [???]
eastwards [???] up the dark [???] land . they could see little [???] for the night
was now so deep that they were hardly aware of the stems of trees before
they [???] against them . the ground became more broken and walking
was
more difficult [???] but [???] seemed in no way troubled . he led them through
thickets and wastes of [???] ; sometimes round the lip of a deep cleft or
dark pit [???] sometimes down into black bush - shrouded hollows and out again ; but
if ever they went a little downward [???] always the further slope was longer and
steeper . they were climbing steadily . at their first halt they looked back [???]
and they could dimly perceive the roofs of the forest they had left behind
lying like a vast dense shadow [???] a darker night under the dark blank sky .
there seemed to be a great blackness looming slowly out of the east [???] eating
up the faint [???] stars . later the sinking moon escaped from the pursuing
cloud [???] but it was ringed all about with a sickly yellow glare .
at last [???] turned to the [???] . ' day soon [???] ' he said . ' [???]
must hurry . not safe to stay in the open in these places . make haste ! '
he quickened his pace [???] and they followed him wearily . soon they began
to climb up on to a great hog - back of land . for the most part it was covered
with a thick growth of gorse and [???] [???] and low tough thorns [???] though

here and there clearings opened [???] the scars of recent fires . the gorse - bushes
became more frequent as they got nearer the top ; very old and tall they
were [???] gaunt and leggy below but thick above [???] and already putting out yellow
flowers that [???] in the gloom and gave a faint sweet scent . so tall
were the spiny thickets that the [???] could walk upright under them [???]
passing through long dry [???] carpeted with a deep prickly mould .
on the further edge of this broad hill - back they stayed their march and
[???] for hiding underneath a tangled knot of thorns . their twisted
boughs [???] stooping to the ground [???] were [???] by a [???] maze of old
briars . deep inside there was a hollow hall [???] [???] with dead branch and
bramble [???] and roofed with the first leaves and shoots of spring . there they
lay for a while [???] too tired yet to eat ; and peering out through the holes in
the covert they watched for the slow growth of day .
but no day came [???] only a dead brown [???] . in the east there was a
dull red glare under the lowering cloud : it was not the red of dawn . across
the tumbled lands between [???] the mountains of the [???] d [???] ath frowned at
them [???]
black and shapeless below where night lay thick and did not pass away [???] above
with jagged tops and edges outlined hard and [???] against the fiery
glow . away to their right a great shoulder of the mountains stood out [???] dark
and black amid the shadows [???] thrusting westward .
` which way do we go from here ? ' asked [???] . ` is that the opening of - of
the [???] valley [???] away over there beyond that black mass ? '
` need we think about it yet ? ' said sam [???] ` surely we ' re not going to move
any more today [???] if day it is ? '
` perhaps not [???] perhaps not [???] ' said [???] . ` but we must go soon [???] to the
cross - roads . yes [???] to the cross - roads . that ' s the way over ther e yes [???]
master . '
the red glare over [???] died away . the [???] deepened as great
vapours rose in the east and [???] above them . [???] and sam took a little
food and then lay down [???] but [???] was restless . he would not eat any of
their food [???] but he drank a little water and then [???] about under the
bushes [???] [???] and muttering . then . suddenly he disappeared .
` off hunting [???] i suppose [???] ' said sam and yawned . it was his turn to sleep
first [???] and he was soon deep in a dream . he thought he was back in the bag
end garden looking for something ; but he had a heavy pack on his back [???] which
made him stoop . it all seemed very weedy and rank somehow [???] and thorns and

[???] were invading the beds down near the bottom hedge .
` a job of work for me [???] i can see ; but i ' m so tired [???] ' he kept on saying .
presently he remembered what he was looking for . ` my pipe ! ' he said [???] and
with that he woke up .
` silly ! ' he said to himself [???] as he opened his eyes and wondered why he
was lying down under the hedge . ` it ' s in your pack all the time ! ' then he
realized [???] first that the pipe might be in his pack but he had no leaf [???] and
next that he was hundreds of miles from bag end . he sat up . it seemed to be
almost dark . why had his master let him sleep on out of turn [???] right on till
evening ?
` haven ' t you had no sleep [???] mr . [???] ? ' he said . ' what ' s the time ? seems
to be getting late ! '
' no it isn ' t [???] ' said [???] . ` but the day is getting darker instead of
lighter : darker and darker . as far as i can tell [???] it isn ' t midday yet [???] and
you ' ve only slept for about three hours . '
' i wonder what ' s up [???] ' said sam . ' is there a storm coming ? if so it ' s
going to be the worst there ever was . we shall wish we were down a deep
hole [???] not just stuck under a hedge . ' he listened . ` what ' s that ? thunder [???] or
drums [???] or what is it ? '
' i don ' t know [???] ' said [???] . ` it ' s been going on for a good while now .
sometimes the ground seems to tremble [???] sometimes it seems to be the heavy
air [???] in your ears . '
sam looked round . ` where ' s [???] ? ' he said . ' hasn ' t he come back
yet ? '
` no [???] ' said [???] . ` there ' s not been a sign or sound of him . '
` well [???] i can ' t abide him [???] ' said sam . ` in fact [???] i ' ve never taken
anything on a journey that i ' d have been less sorry to lose on the way . but
it would be just like him [???] after coming all these miles [???] to go and get lost
now [???] just when we shall need him most - - that is [???] if he ' s ever going to be
any use [???] which i doubt . '
` you forget the marshes [???] ' said [???] . ` i hope nothing has happened to
him . '
` and i hope he ' s up to no tricks . and anyway i hope he doesn ' t fall
into other hands [???] as you might say . because if he does [???] we shall soon be in
for trouble . '
at that moment a rolling and rumbling noise was heard again [???] louder now
and deeper . the ground seemed to quiver under their feet . ' i think we are in

for trouble anyhow [???] ' said [???] . ` i ' m afraid our journey is drawing to an
end . '
' maybe [???] ' said sam ; ` but where there ' s life there ' s hope [???] as my [???]
used to say ; and need of [???] [???] as he mostways used to add . you have a
bite [???] mr . [???] [???] and then a bit of sleep . '
the afternoon [???] as sam supposed it must be called [???] wore on . looking out
from the covert he could see only a dun [???] shadowless world [???] fading slowly
into a featureless [???] colourless gloom . it felt [???] but not warm . [???]
slept [???] [???] turning and tossing [???] and sometimes murmuring . twice sam
thought he heard him speaking [???] ' s name . the time seemed to drag
[???] . suddenly sam heard a hiss behind him [???] and there was [???]
on
all fours [???] peering at them with gleaming eyes .
` wake up [???] wake up ! wake up [???] sleepies ! ' he whispered . ` wake up ! no time
to lose . we must go [???] yes [???] we must go at once . no time to lose ! '
sam stared at him suspiciously : he seemed frightened or excited . ` go
now ? what ' s your little game ? it isn ' t time yet . it can ' t be tea - time even [???]
leastways not in decent places where there is tea - time . '
` silly ! ' [???] [???] . ` we ' re not in decent places . time ' s running
short [???] yes [???] running fast . no time to lose . we must go . wake up . master [???] wake
u he [???] at [???] ; and [???] [???] startled out of sleep [???] sat up suddenly and
seized him by the arm . [???] tore h imself loose and backed away .
' they mustn ' t be silly [???] ' he [???] . ` we must go . no time to lose ! ' and
nothing more could they get out of him . where he had been [???] and what he
thought was brewing to make him in such a hurry [???] he would not say . sam was
filled with deep suspicion [???] and showed it ; but [???] gave no sign of what
was passing in his mind . he sighed [???] hoisted his pack [???] and prepared to go out
into the ever - gathering darkness .
very [???] [???] led them down the hillside [???] keeping under cover
wherever it was possible [???] and running [???] almost bent to the ground [???] across any
open space ; but the light was now so dim that even a keen - eyed beast of the
wild could scarcely have seen the [???] [???] hooded [???] in their grey cloaks [???] nor
heard them [???] walking as warily as the little people can . without the crack of
a twig or the rustle of a leaf they passed and vanished .
for about an hour they went on [???] silently [???] in single file [???] oppressed by
the gloom and by the absolute stillness of the land [???] broken only now and
again by the faint rumbling as of thunder far away or drum - beats in some

hollow of the hills . down from their hiding - place they went [???] and then
turning south they steered as straight a course as [???] could find across
a long broken slope that leaned up towards the mountains . presently [???] not far
ahead [???] looming up like a black wall [???] they saw a belt of trees . as they drew
nearer they became aware that these were of vast size [???] very ancient it
seemed [???] and still towering high [???] though their tops were gaunt and broken [???] as
if tempest and lightning - blast had swept across them [???] but had failed to kill
them or to shake their fathomless roots .
' the cross - roads [???] yes [???] ' whispered [???] [???] the first words that had been
spoken since they left their hiding - place . ' we must go that way . ' turning
eastward now [???] he led them up the slope ; and then suddenly there it was
before them : the southward road [???] winding its way about the outer feet of the
mountains [???] until presently it [???] into the great ring of trees .
' this is the only way [???] ' whispered [???] . ' no paths beyond the road . no
paths . we must go to the cross - roads . but make haste ! be silent ! '
as [???] as scouts within the campment of their enemies [???] they crept
down on to the road [???] and stole along its westward edge under the stony bank [???]
grey as the stones themselves [???] and soft - footed as hunting cats . at length
they reached the trees [???] and found that they stood in a great roofless ring [???]
open in the middle to the [???] sky ; and the spaces between their immense
boles were like the great dark arches of some ruined hall . in the very
centre four ways met . behind them lay the road to the [???] ; before them
it ran out again upon its long journey south ; to their right the road from
old [???] came climbing up [???] and crossing [???] passed out eastward into
darkness : the fourth way [???] the road they were to take .
standing there for a moment filled with dread [???] became aware that a
light was shining ; he saw it glowing on sam ' s face beside him . turning
towards it [???] he saw [???] beyond an arch of boughs [???] the road to [???] running
almost as straight as a stretched ribbon down [???] down [???] into the west . there [???]
far away [???] beyond sad [???] now overwhelmed in shade [???] the sun was
sinking [???]
finding at last the hem of the great slow - rolling pall of cloud [???] and falling
in an [???] fire towards the yet [???] sea . the brief glow fell upon a
huge sitting figure [???] still and solemn as the great stone kings of [???] .
the years had gnawed it [???] and violent hands had [???] it . its head was gone [???]
and in its place was set in mockery a round rough - hewn stone [???] rudely painted
by savage hands in the likeness of a grinning face with one large red eye in

the midst of its forehead . upon its knees and mighty chair [???] and all about
the [???] [???] were idle [???] mixed with the foul [???] that the
[???] - folk of [???] used .
suddenly [???] caught by the level beams [???] [???] saw the old king ' s head : it
was lying rolled away by the roadside . ` look [???] sam ! ' he cried [???] startled into
speech . ` look ! the king has got a crown again ! '
the eyes were hollow and the carven beard was broken [???] but about the
high stern forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold . a trailing plant
with flowers like small white stars had bound itself across the brows as if
in reverence for the fallen king [???] and in the [???] of his stony hair
yellow [???] gleamed .
' they cannot conquer for ever ! ' said [???] . and then suddenly the brief
glimpse was gone . the sun dipped and vanished [???] and as if at the shuttering
of a lamp [???] black night fell .




chapter 8 . the stairs of [???] ungol



[???] was tugging at [???] ' s cloak and hissing with fear and
impatience . ` we must go [???] ' he said . ` we mustn ' t stand here . make haste ! '
[???] [???] turned his back on the west and followed as his guide
led him [???] out into the darkness of the east . they left the ring of trees and
crept along the road towards the mountains . this road [???] too [???] ran straight for
a while [???] but soon it began to bend away southwards [???] until it came right
under the great shoulder of rock that they had seen from the distance . black
and forbidding it loomed above them [???] darker than the dark sky behind .
[???] ing under its shadow the road went on [???] and rounding it sprang east
again and began to climb steeply .
[???] and sam were [???] along with heavy hearts [???] no longer able to
care greatly about their peril . [???] ' s head was bowed ; his burden was
dragging him down again . as soon as the great cross - roads had been passed [???]
the weight of it [???] almost forgotten in [???] [???] had begun to grow once more .
now [???] feeling the way become steep before his feet [???] he looked wearily up ; and
then he saw it [???] even as [???] had said that he would : the city of the
[???] . he cowered against the stony bank .
a long - tilted valley [???] a deep gulf of shadow [???] ran back far into the
mountains . upon the further side [???] some way within the valley ' s arms high on
a rocky seat upon the black knees of the [???] d [???] ath [???] stood the walls and
tower of minas [???] . all was dark about it [???] earth and sky [???] but it was lit
with light . not the imprisoned moonlight welling through the marble walls of
minas [???] long ago [???] tower of the moon [???] fair and radiant in the hollow of
the hills . paler indeed than the moon ailing in some slow eclipse was the
light of it now [???] wavering and blowing like a noisome [???] of decay [???] a
corpse - light [???] a light that [???] nothing . in the walls and tower
windows showed [???] like countless black holes looking inward into emptiness ;
but the topmost course of the tower revolved slowly [???] first one way and then
another [???] a huge ghostly head leering into the night . for a moment the three
companions stood there [???] shrinking [???] staring up with unwilling eyes . [???]
was the first to recover . again he pulled at their cloaks urgently [???] but he
spoke no word . almost he dragged them forward . every step was [???] [???] and
time seemed to slow its pace . so that between the raising of a foot and the

setting of it down minutes of loathing passed .
so they came slowly to the white bridge . here the road [???] gleaming
faintly [???] passed over the stream in the midst of the valley [???] and went on [???]
winding deviously up towards the city ' s gate : a black mouth opening in the
outer circle of the northward walls . wide flats lay on either bank [???] shadowy
meads filled with pale white flowers . [???] these were too [???] beautiful and
yet horrible of shape [???] like the demented forms in an uneasy dream ; and they
gave forth a faint sickening charnel - smell ; an odour of rottenness filled
the air . from mead to mead the bridge sprang . figures stood there at its
head [???] carven with cunning in forms human and bestial [???] but all corrupt and
loathsome . the water flowing beneath was silent [???] and it steamed [???] but the
vapour that rose from it [???] curling and twisting about the bridge [???] was deadly
cold . [???] felt his senses [???] and his mind darkening . then suddenly [???]
as if some force were at work other than his own will [???] he began to hurry [???]
tottering forward [???] his groping hands held out [???] his head lolling from side to
side . both sam and [???] ran after him . sam caught his master in his arms [???]
as he [???] and almost fell [???] right on the [???] of the bridge .
` not that way ! no [???] not that way ! ' whispered [???] [???] but the breath
between his teeth seemed to tear the heavy stillness like a whistle [???] and he
cowered to the ground in terror .
` hold up [???] mr . [???] ! ' muttered sam in [???] ' s ear . ' come back ! not
that way . [???] says not [???] and for once i agree with him . '
[???] passed his hand over his brow and wrenched his eyes away from the
city on the hill . the [???] tower [???] him [???] and he fought the
desire that was on him to run up the gleaming road towards its gate . at last
with an effort he turned back [???] and as he did so [???] he felt the ring resisting
him [???] dragging at the chain about his neck ; and his eyes too [???] as he looked
away [???] seemed for the moment to have been blinded . the darkness before him
was [???] .
[???] [???] [???] on the ground like a frightened animal [???] was already
vanishing into the gloom . sam [???] supporting and guiding his stumbling master [???]
followed after him as quickly as he could . not far from the near bank of the
stream there was a gap in the stone - wall beside the road . through this they
passed [???] and sam saw that they were on a narrow path that gleamed faintly at
first [???] as the main road did [???] until climb ing above the meads of deadly
flowers it faded and went dark [???] winding its crooked way up into the northern
sides of the valley .

along this path the [???] [???] [???] side by side [???] unable to see [???]
in front of them [???] except when he turned back to beckon them on . then his
eyes shone with a green - white light [???] reflecting the noisome [???] - sheen
perhaps [???] or kindled by some answering mood within . of that deadly gleam and
of the dark [???] [???] and sam were always conscious [???] ever glancing
fearfully over their shoulders [???] and ever dragging their eyes back to find
the darkening path . slowly they laboured on . as they rose above the stench
and vapours of the poisonous stream their breath became easier and their
heads clearer ; but now their limbs were deadly tired [???] as if they had walked
all night under a burden [???] or had been swimming long against a heavy tide of
water . at last they could go no further without a halt .
[???] stopped and sat down on a stone . they had now climbed up to the
top of a great hump of bare rock . ahead of them there was a bay in the
valley - side [???] and round the head of this the path went on [???] no more than a
wide ledge with a chasm on the right ; across the sheer southward face of the
mountain it [???] upwards [???] until it disappeared into the blackness above .
` i must rest a while [???] sam [???] ' whispered [???] . ` it ' s heavy on me [???] sam
lad [???] very heavy . i wonder how far i can carry it ? anyway i must rest before
we venture on to that . ' he pointed to the narrow way ahead .
` [???] ! ssh ! ' [???] [???] hurrying back to them . ` [???] ! ' his fingers
were on his lips and he shook his head urgently . tugging at [???] ' s sleeve [???]
he pointed towards the path ; but [???] would not move .
` not yet [???] ' he said [???] ' not yet . ' weariness and more than weariness
oppressed him ; it seemed as if a heavy spell was laid on his mind and body .
` i must rest [???] ' he muttered .
at this [???] ' s fear and agitation became so great that he spoke
again [???] hissing behind his hand [???] as if to keep the sound from unseen
listeners in the air . ` not here [???] no . not rest here . fools ! eyes can see us .
when they come to the bridge they will see us . come away ! climb [???] climb !
come ! '
` come [???] mr . [???] [???] ' said sam . ` he ' s right [???] again . we can ' t stay here . '
' all right [???] ' said [???] in a remote voice [???] as of one speaking half
asleep . ` i will try . ' wearily he got to his feet .
but it was too late . at that moment the rock [???] and trembled
beneath them . the great rumbling noise [???] louder than ever before [???] rolled in
the ground and echoed in the mountains . then with searing suddenness there
came a great red flash . far beyond the eastern mountains it leapt into the

sky and [???] the lowering clouds with cr imson . in that valley of shadow
and cold deathly light it seemed [???] violent and fierce . peaks of
stone and ridges like notched knives sprang out in staring black against the
[???] flame in [???] . then came a great crack of thunder .
and minas [???] answered . there was a flare of livid lightnings : forks
of blue flame springing up from the tower and from the [???] hills into
the sullen clouds . the earth groaned ; and out of the city there came a cry .
mingled with harsh high voices as of birds of prey [???] and the shrill neighing
of horses wild with rage and fear [???] there came a rending screech [???] shivering [???]
rising swiftly to a piercing pitch beyond the range of hearing . the [???]
wheeled round towards it [???] and cast themselves down [???] holding their hands upon
their ears .
as the terrible cry ended [???] falling back through a long sickening wail
to silence [???] [???] slowly raised his head . across the narrow valley [???] now
almost on a level with his eyes [???] the walls of the evil city stood [???] and its
[???] gate [???] shaped like an open mouth with gleaming teeth [???] was gaping
wide . and out of the gate an army came .
all that host was clad in sable [???] dark as the night . against the wan
walls and the [???] pavement of the road [???] could see them [???] small
black figures in rank upon rank [???] marching swiftly and silently [???] passing
outwards in an endless stream . before them went a great [???] of horsemen
moving like ordered shadows [???] and at their head was one greater than all the
rest : a rider [???] all black [???] save that on his hooded head he had a helm like a
crown that [???] with a perilous light . now he was drawing near the
bridge below [???] and [???] ' s staring eyes followed him [???] unable to wink or to
withdraw . surely there was the lord of the nine riders returned to earth to
lead his ghastly host to battle ? here [???] yes here indeed was the [???] king
whose cold hand had smitten down the ring - bearer with his deadly knife . the
old wound [???] with pain and a great chill spread towards [???] ' s heart .
even as these thoughts pierced him with dread and held him bound as
with a spell [???] the rider halted suddenly [???] right before the entrance of the
bridge [???] and behind him all the host stood still . there was a pause [???] a dead
silence . maybe it was the ring that called to the wraith - lord [???] and for a
moment he was troubled [???] sensing some other power within his valley . this way
and that turned the dark head helmed and crowned with fear [???] sweeping the
shadows with its unseen eyes . [???] waited [???] like a bird at the approach of a
snake [???] unable to move . and as he waited [???] he felt [???] more urgent than ever

before [???] the command that he should put on the ring . but great as the
pressure was [???] he felt no inclination now to yield to it . he knew that the
ring would only betray him [???] and that he had not [???] even if he put it on [???] the
power to face the [???] - king - not yet . there was no longer any answer to
that command in his own will [???] dismayed by terror though it was [???] and he felt
only the beating upon him of a great power from outside . it took his hand [???]
and as [???] watched with his mind [???] not willing it but in [???] ( as if he
looked on some old story far away ) [???] it moved the hand inch by inch towards
the chain upon his neck . then his own will stirred ; slowly it forced the
hand back . and set it to find another thing [???] a thing lying hidden near his
breast . cold and hard it seemed as his grip closed on it : the phial of
[???] [???] so long treasured [???] and almost forgotten till that hour . as he
touched it [???] for a while all thought of the ring was banished from his mind .
he sighed and bent his head .
at that moment the wraith - king turned and spurred his horse and rode
across the bridge [???] and all his dark host followed him . maybe the elven - hoods
defied his unseen eyes [???] and the mind of his small enemy ; being strengthened [???]
had turned aside his thought . but he was in haste . already the hour had
struck [???] and at his great master ' s bidding he must march with war into the
west .
soon he had passed [???] like a shadow into shadow [???] down the winding road [???]
and behind him still the black ranks crossed the bridge . so great an army
had never issued from that vale since the days of [???] ' s might ; no host
so fell and strong in arms had yet assailed the fords of [???] ; and yet it
was but one and not the greatest of the hosts that [???] now sent forth .
[???] stirred . and suddenly his heart went out to [???] . ' the storm
has burst at last [???] ' he thought . ` this great array of spears and swords is
going to [???] . will [???] get across in time ? he guessed it [???] but did
he know the hour ? and who can now hold the fords when the king of the
nine
riders comes ? and other armies will come . i am too late . all is lost . i
tarried on the way . all is lost . even if my errand is performed [???] no one will
ever know . there will be no one i can tell . it will be in vain . ' overcome
with weakness he wept . and still the host of [???] crossed the bridge .
then at a great distance [???] as if it came out of memories of the shire [???]
some [???] early morning [???] when the day called and doors were opening [???] he
heard sam ' s voice speaking . ` wake up [???] mr . [???] ! wake up ! ' had the voice

added : ` your breakfast is ready [???] ' he would hardly have been surprised .
certainly sam was urgent . ` wake up [???] mr . [???] ! they ' re gone [???] ' he said .
there was a dull clang . the gates of minas [???] had closed . the last
rank of spears had vanished down the road . the tower still grinned across
the valley [???] but the light was fading in it . the whole city was falling back
into a dark brooding shade [???] and silence . yet still it was filled with
watchfulness .
' wake up [???] mr . [???] ! they ' re gone [???] and we ' d better go too . there ' s
something still alive in that place [???] something with eyes [???] or a seeing mind [???]
if you take me ; and the longer we stay in one spot [???] the sooner it will get
on to us . come on [???] mr . [???] ! '
[???] raised his head [???] and then stood up . despair had not left him [???] but
the weakness had passed . he even smiled grimly [???] feeling now as clearly as a
moment before he had felt the opposite [???] that what he had to do [???] he had to
do [???] if he could [???] and that whether [???] or [???] or [???] or [???]
or [???] or anyone e lse ever knew about it was beside the purpose . he took
his staff in one hand and the phial in his other . when he saw that the clear
light was already welling through his fingers [???] he thrust it into his bosom
and held it against his heart . then turning from the city of [???] [???] now no
more than a grey glimmer across a dark gulf [???] he prepared to take the upward
road .
[???] [???] it seemed [???] had [???] off along the ledge into the darkness
beyond [???] when the gates of minas [???] opened [???] leaving the [???] where
they lay . he now came creeping back [???] his teeth chattering and his fingers
snapping . ` foolish ! silly ! ' he [???] . ` make haste ! they mustn ' t think
danger has passed . it hasn ' t . make haste ! '
they did not answer [???] but they followed him on to the climbing ledge . it
was little to the liking of either of them [???] not even after facing so many
other perils ; but it did not last long . soon the path reached a rounded
angle where the mountain - side swelled out again [???] and there it suddenly
entered a narrow opening in the rock . they had come to the first stair that
[???] had spoken of . the darkness was almost complete [???] and they could see
nothing much beyond their hands ' stretch ; but [???] ' s eyes shone pale [???]
several feet above [???] as he turned back towards them .
` careful ! ' he whispered . ` steps . lots of steps . must be careful ! '
care was certainly needed . [???] and sam at first felt easier [???] having
now a wall on either side [???] but the stairway was almost as steep as a ladder [???]

and as they climbed up and up [???] they became more and more aware of the long
black fall behind them . and the steps were narrow [???] spaced [???] [???] and
often treacherous : they were worn and smooth at the edges [???] and some were
broken [???] and some cracked as foot was set upon them . the [???] struggled
on [???] until at last they were [???] with desperate fingers to the steps
ahead [???] and forcing their aching knees to bend and straighten ; and ever as
the stair cut its way deeper into the sheer mountain the rocky walls rose
higher and higher above their heads .
at length [???] just as they felt that they could endure no more [???] they saw
[???] ' s eyes peering down at them again . ` we ' re up [???] ' he whispered . ' first
stair ' s past . clever [???] to climb so high [???] very clever [???] . just a
few more little steps and that ' s all [???] yes . '
[???] and very tired sam [???] and [???] following him [???] [???] up the last
step [???] and sat down rubbing their legs and knees . they were in a deep dark
passage that seemed still to go up before them [???] though at a gentler slope
and without steps . [???] did not let them rest long .
' there ' s another stair still [???] ' he said . ` much longer stair . rest when
we get to the top of next stair . not yet . '
sam groaned . ' longer [???] did you say ? ' he asked .
' yes [???] yess [???] longer [???] ' said [???] . ` but not so difficult . [???] have
climbed the straight stair . next comes the winding stair . '
' and what after that ? ' said sam .
` we shall see [???] ' said [???] softly . ` o yes [???] we shall see ! '
' i thought you said there was a tunnel [???] ' said sam . ` isn ' t there a
tunnel or something to go through ? '
' o yes [???] there ' s a tunnel [???] ' said [???] . ` but [???] can rest before
they try that . if they get through that [???] they ' ll be nearly at the top . very
nearly [???] if they get through . o yes ! '
[???] shivered . the climb had made him sweat [???] but now he felt cold and
[???] [???] and there was a chill draught in the dark passage [???] blowing down from
the invisible heights above . he got up and shook himself . ` well [???] let ' s go
on ! ' he said . ` this is no place to sit in . '
the passage seemed to go on for miles [???] and always the chill air flowed
over them [???] rising as they went on to a bitter wind . the mountains seemed to
be trying with their deadly breath to daunt them [???] to turn them back from the
secrets of the high places [???] or to blow them away into the darkness behind .
they only knew that they had come to the end [???] when suddenly they felt no

wall at their right hand . they could see very little . great black shapeless
masses and deep grey shadows loomed above them and about them [???] but now
and
again a dull red light [???] up under the lowering clouds [???] and for a
moment they were aware of tall peaks [???] in front and on either side [???] like
pillars holding up a vast sagging roof . they seemed to have climbed up many
hundreds of feet [???] on to a wide shelf . a cliff was on their left and a chasm
on their right .
[???] led the way close under the cliff . for the present they were no
longer climbing [???] but the ground was now more broken and dangerous in the
dark [???] and there were blocks and lumps of fallen stone in the way . their
going was slow and [???] . how many hours had passed since they had
entered the [???] vale neither sam nor [???] could any longer guess . the
night seemed endless .
at length they were once more aware of a wall looming up [???] and once more
a stairway opened before them . again they halted [???] and again they began to
climb . it was a long and weary ascent ; but this stairway did not delve into
the mountain - side . here the huge cliff face [???] backwards [???] and the path
like a snake wound to and fro across it . at one point it [???] sideways
right to the edge of the dark chasm [???] and [???] glancing down saw below him
as a vast deep pit the great ravine at the head of the [???] valley . down
in its depths [???] like a glow - worm thread the wraith - road from the
dead city to the nameless pass . he turned hastily away .
still on and up the stairway bent and [???] [???] until at last with a
final flight [???] short and straight [???] it climbed out again on to another level .
the path had veered away from the main pass in the great ravine [???] and it now
followed its own perilous course at the bottom of a lesser cleft among the
higher regions of the [???] d [???] ath . dimly the [???] could discern tall
piers and jagged [???] of stone on either side [???] between which were great
[???] and [???] blacker than the night [???] where forgotten winter s had
gnawed and carved the sunless stone . and now the red light in the sky seemed
stronger ; though they could not tell whether a dreadful morning were indeed
coming to this place of shadow [???] or whether they saw only the flame of some
great violence of [???] in the torment of [???] beyond . still far
ahead [???] and still high above [???] [???] [???] looking up [???] saw [???] as he guessed [???] the very
crown of this bitter road . against the sullen redness of the eastern sky a
cleft was outlined in the topmost ridge [???] narrow [???] deep - cloven between two

black shoulders ; and on either shoulder was a horn of stone .
he paused and looked more attentively . the horn upon the left was tall
and slender ; and in it burned a red light [???] or else the red light in the land
beyond was shining through a hole . he saw now : it was a black tower poised
above the outer pass . he touched sam ' s arm and pointed .
' i don ' t like the look of that ! ' said sam . ` so this secret way of
yours is guarded after all [???] ' he growled [???] turning to [???] . ' as you knew all
along [???] i suppose ? '
' all ways are watched [???] yes [???] ' said [???] . ` of course they are . but
[???] must try some way . this may be least watched . perhaps they ' ve all
gone away to big battle [???] perhaps ! '
' perhaps [???] ' [???] sam . ' well [???] it still seems a long way off [???] and a
long way up before we get there . and there ' s still the tunnel . i think you
ought to rest now [???] mr . [???] . i don ' t know what time of day or night it is [???]
but we ' ve kept going for hours and hours . '
` yes [???] we must rest [???] ' said [???] . ' let us find some corner out of the
wind [???] and gather our strength - for the last lap . ' for so he felt it to be .
the terrors of the land beyond [???] and the deed to be done there [???] seemed
remote [???] too far off yet to trouble him . all his mind was bent on getting
through or over this [???] wall and guard . if once he could do that
impossible thing [???] then somehow the errand would be accomplished [???] or so it
seemed to him in that dark hour of weariness [???] still labouring in the stony
shadows under [???] ungol .
in a dark [???] between two great piers of rock they sat down : [???]
and sam a little way within . and [???] [???] upon the ground near the
opening . there the [???] took what they expected would be their last meal
before they went down into the nameless land [???] maybe the last meal they
would
ever eat together . some of the food of [???] they ate [???] and [???] of the
[???] of the elves . and they drank a little . but of their water they were
sparing and took only enough to moisten their dry mouths .
` i wonder when we ' ll find water again ? ' said sam . ' but i suppose even
over there they drink ? [???] drink [???] don ' t they ? '
' yes [???] they drink [???] ' said [???] . ' but do not let us speak of that . such
drink is not for us . '
` then all the more need to fill our bottles [???] ' said sam . ` but there
isn ' t any water up here : not a sound or a trickle have i heard . and anyway

[???] said we were not to drink any water in [???] . '
' no water flowing out of [???] [???] [???] were his words [???] ' said [???] . ` we
are not in that valley now [???] and if we came on a spring it would be flowing
into it and not out of it . '
' i wouldn ' t trust it [???] ' said sam [???] ' not till i was dying of thirst .
there ' s a wicked feeling about this place . ' he [???] . ' and a smell [???] i
fancy . do you notice it ? a queer kind of a smell [???] stuffy . i don ' t like it . '
' i don ' t like anything here at all . ' said [???] [???] ` step or stone [???] breath
or bone . earth [???] air and water all seem accursed . but so our path is laid . '
' yes [???] that ' s so [???] ' said sam . ` and we shouldn ' t be here at all [???] if we ' d
known more about it before we started . but i suppose it ' s often that way .
the brave things in the old tales and songs [???] mr . [???] : adventures [???] as i
used to call them . i used to think that they were things the wonderful folk
of the stories went out and looked for [???] because they wanted them [???] because
they were exciting and life was a bit dull [???] a kind of a sport [???] as you might
say . but that ' s not the way of it with the tales that really mattered [???] or
the ones that stay in the mind . folk seem to have been just landed in them [???]
usually - - their paths were laid that way [???] as you put it . but i expect they
had lots of chances [???] like us [???] of turning back [???] only they didn ' t . and if they
had [???] we shouldn ' t know [???] because they ' d have been forgotten . we hear about
those as just went on - - and not all to a good end [???] mind you ; at least not
to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end . you know [???]
coming home [???] and finding things all right [???] though not quite the same - - like
old mr [???] . but those aren ' t always the best tales to hear [???] though they
may be the best tales to get landed in ! i wonder what sort of a tale we ' ve
fallen into ? '
` i wonder [???] ' said [???] . ' but i don ' t know . and that ' s the way of a real
tale . take any one that you ' re fond of . you may know [???] or guess [???] what kind of
a tale it is [???] happy - ending or sad - ending [???] but the people in it don ' t know .
and you don ' t want them to . '
' no [???] sir [???] of course not . beren now [???] he never thought he was going to
get that [???] from the iron crown in [???] [???] and yet he did [???] and
that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours . but that ' s a long
tale [???] of course [???] and goes on past the happiness and into grief and beyond it
- - and the [???] went on and came to [???] . and why [???] sir [???] i never
thought of that before ! we ' ve got - - you ' ve got some of the light of it in
that star - glass that the lady gave you ! why [???] to think of it [???] we ' re in the

same tale still ! it ' s going on . don ' t the great tales never end ? '
' no [???] they never end as tales [???] ' said [???] . ` but the people in them
come [???] and go when their part ' s ended . our part will end later - - or sooner . '
' and then we can have some rest and some sleep [???] ' said sam . he laughed
grimly . ' and i mean just that [???] mr . [???] . i mean plain ordinary rest [???] and
sleep [???] and waking up to a morning ' s work in the garden . i ' m afraid that ' s
all i ' m hoping for all the time . all the big important plans are not for my
sort . still [???] i wonder if we shall ever be put into songs or tales . we ' re in
one [???] or course ; but i mean : put into words [???] you know [???] told by the fireside [???]
or read out of a great big book with red and black letters [???] years and years
afterwards . and people will say : [???] let ' s hear about [???] and the ring ! [???] and
they ' ll say : [???] yes [???] that ' s one of my favourite stories . [???] was very brave .
wasn ' t he [???] dad ? [???] [???] yes [???] my boy [???] the famousest of the [???] [???] and that ' s
saying a lot . [???] '
` it ' s saying a lot too much [???] ' said [???] [???] and he laughed [???] a long clear
laugh from his heart . such a sound had not been heard in those places since
[???] came to middle - earth . to sam suddenly it seemed as if all the stones
were listen ing and the tall rocks leaning over them . but [???] did not heed
them ; he laughed again . ' why [???] sam [???] ' he said [???] ' to hear you somehow makes me
as merry as if the story was already written . but you ' ve left out one of the
chief characters : [???] the [???] . [???] i want to hear more about sam [???]
dad . why didn ' t they put in more of his talk [???] dad ? that ' s what i like [???] it
makes me laugh . and [???] wouldn ' t have got far without sam [???] would he [???]
dad ?
[???] '
` now [???] mr . [???] [???] ' said sam [???] ' you shouldn ' t make fun . i was serious . '
` so was i [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and so i am . we ' re going on a bit too fast .
you and i [???] sam [???] are still stuck in the worst places of the story [???] and it is
all too likely that some will say at this point : [???] shut the book now [???] dad ; we
don ' t want to read any more . [???] '
` maybe [???] ' said sam [???] ' but i wouldn ' t be one to say that . things done and
over and made into part of the great tales are different . why [???] even [???]
might be good in a tale [???] better than he is to have by you [???] anyway . and he
used to like tales himself once [???] by his own account . i wonder if he thinks
he ' s the hero or the villain ?
` [???] ! ' he called . ` would you like to be the hero - - now where ' s he
got to again ? '

there was no sign of him at the mouth of their shelter nor in the
shadows near . he had refused their food [???] though he had [???] as usual [???] accepted a
mouthful of water ; and then he had seemed to curl up for a sleep : they had
supposed that one at any rate of his objects in his long absence the day
befor e had been to hunt for food to his own liking ; and now he had evidently
slipped off again while they talked . but what for this time ?
` i don ' t like his sneaking off without saying [???] ' said sam . ' and least of
all now . he can ' t be looking for food up here [???] not unless there ' s some kind
of rock he fancies . why [???] there isn ' t even a bit of moss ! '
` it ' s no good [???] about him now [???] ' said [???] . ` we couldn ' t have
got so far [???] not even within sight of the pass [???] without him [???] and so we ' ll
have to put up with his ways . if he ' s false [???] he ' s false . '
' all the same [???] i ' d rather have him under my eye [???] ' said sam . ' all the
more so [???] if he ' s false . do you remember he never would say if this pass was
guarded or no ? and now we see a tower there - - and it may be deserted [???] and
it may not . do you think he ' s gone to fetch them [???] [???] or whatever they
are ? '
` no [???] i don ' t think so [???] ' answered [???] . ' even if he ' s up to some
wickedness [???] and i suppose that ' s not unlikely [???] i don ' t think it ' s that : no t
to fetch [???] [???] or any servants of the enemy . why wait till now [???] and go
through all the labour of the climb [???] and come so near the land he fears ? he
could probably have betrayed us to [???] many times since we met him . no [???] if
it ' s anything [???] it wil l be some little private trick of his own - that he
thinks is quite secret . '
` well [???] i suppose you ' re right [???] mr . [???] [???] ' said sam . ' not that it
comforts me mightily . i don ' t make no mistake : i don ' t doubt he ' d hand me
over to [???] as gladly as kiss his hand . but i was forgetting - - his
precious . no [???] i suppose the whole time it ' s been the precious for poor
[???] . that ' s the one idea in all his little [???] [???] if he has any . but
how bringing us up here will help him in that is more than i can guess . '
' very likely he can ' t guess himself [???] ' said [???] . ` and i don ' t think
he ' s got just one plain [???] in his [???] head . i think he really is in
part trying to save the precious from the enemy . as long as he can . for that
would be the last disaster for himself too . if the enemy got it . and in the
other part [???] perhaps [???] he ' s just biding his time and waiting on chance . '
' yes [???] [???] and [???] [???] as i ' ve said before [???] ' said sam . ' but the
nearer they get to the enemy ' s land the more like [???] [???] will get .

mark my words : if ever we get to the pass [???] he won ' t let us really take the
precious thing over the border without making some kind of trouble . '
` we haven ' t got there yet [???] ' said [???] .
' no [???] but we ' d better keep our eyes skinned till we do . if we ' re caught
napping [???] [???] will come out on top pretty quick . not but what it would be
safe for you to have a wink now [???] master . safe [???] if you lay close to me . i ' d
be dearly glad to see you have a sleep . i ' d keep watch over you ; and anyway [???]
if you lay near [???] with my arm round you [???] no one could come [???] you
without
your sam knowing it . '
` sleep ! ' said [???] and sighed [???] as if out of a desert he had seen a
mirage of cool green . ' yes [???] even here i could sleep . '
` sleep then [???] master ! lay your head in my lap . '
and so [???] found them hours later [???] when he returned [???] [???] and
creeping down the path out of the gloom ahead . sam sat propped against the
stone [???] his head dropping sideways and his breathing heavy . in his lap lay
[???] ' s head [???] drowned deep in sleep ; upon his white forehead lay one of
sam ' s brown hands [???] and the other lay softly upon his master ' s breast . peace
was in both their faces .
[???] looked at them . a strange expression passed over his lean hungry
face . the gleam faded from his eyes [???] and they went dim and grey [???] old and
tired . a spasm of pain seemed to twist him [???] and he turned away [???] peering back
up towards the pass [???] shaking his head [???] as if engaged in some interior
debate . then he came back [???] and slowly putting out a trembling hand [???] very
[???] he touched [???] ' s knee - - but almost the touch was a caress . for
a fleeting moment [???] could one of the sleepers have seen him [???] they would have
thought that they beheld an old weary hobbit [???] [???] by the years that had
carried him far beyond his time [???] beyond friends and kin [???] and the fields and
streams of youth [???] an old starved pitiable thing .
but at that touch [???] stirred and cried out softly in his sleep [???] and
immediately sam was wide awake . the first thing he saw was [???] - -
` [???]
at master [???] ' as he thought .
` hey you ! ' he said roughly . ` what are you up to ? '
' nothing [???] nothing [???] ' said [???] softly . ` nice master ! '
` i daresay [???] ' said sam . ' but where have you been to - - sneaking off and
sneaking back [???] you old villain ? '

[???] withdrew himself [???] and a green glint [???] under his heavy
lids . almost spider - like he looked now [???] [???] back on his bent limbs [???]
with his [???] eyes . the fleeting moment had passed [???] beyond recall .
` sneaking [???] sneaking ! ' he [???] . ' [???] always so polite [???] yes . o nice
[???] ! [???] brings them up secret ways that nobody else could find .
tired he is [???] thirsty he is [???] yes thirsty ; and he guides them and he searches
for paths [???] and they say sneak [???] sneak . very nice friends [???] o yes my precious [???]
very nice . '
sam felt a bit remorseful [???] though not more trustful . ' sorry . ' he said .
' i ' m sorry [???] but you startled me out of my sleep . and i shouldn ' t have been
sleeping [???] and that made me a bit sharp . but mr . [???] . he ' s that tired [???] i
asked him to have a wink ; and well [???] that ' s how it is . sorry . but where have
you been to ? '
` sneaking [???] ' said [???] [???] and the green glint did not leave his eyes .
' o very well [???] ' said sam [???] ` have it your own way ! i don ' t suppose it ' s so
far from the truth . and now we ' d better all be sneaking along together .
what ' s the time ? is it today or tomorrow ? '
' it ' s tomorrow [???] ' said [???] [???] ' or this was tomorrow when [???] went
to sleep . very foolish [???] very dangerous - if poor [???] wasn ' t sneaking about
to watch . '
` i think we shall get tired of that word soon [???] ' said sam . ' but never
mind . i ' ll wake master up . ' gently he smoothed the hair back fr om [???] ' s
brow [???] and bending down spoke softly to him .
` wake up [???] mr . [???] ! wake up ! '
[???] stirred and opened his eyes [???] and smiled [???] seeing sam ' s face
bending over him . ` calling me early aren ' t you [???] sam ? ' he said . ` it ' s dark
still ! '
' yes it ' s always dark here [???] ' said sam . ` but [???] ' s come back mr .
[???] [???] and he says it ' s tomorrow . so we must be walking on . the last lap . '
[???] drew a deep breath and sat up . ` the last lap ! ' he said . ' hullo [???]
[???] ! found any food ? have you had any rest ? '
` no food [???] no rest [???] nothing for [???] [???] ' said [???] . ` he ' s a sneak . '
sam clicked his tongue [???] but restrained himself .
' don ' t take names to yourself [???] [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' it ' s unwise
whether they are true or false . '
` [???] has to take what ' s given him [???] ' answered [???] . ' he was given
that name by kind master [???] [???] the hobbit that knows so much . '

[???] looked at sam . ' yes sir [???] ' he said . ` i did use the word [???] waking up
out of my sleep sudden and all and finding him at hand . i said i was sorry [???]
but i soon shan ' t be . '
' come [???] let it pass then [???] ' said [???] . ' but now we seem to have come to
the point [???] you and i [???] [???] . tell me . can we find the rest of the way by
ourselves ? we ' re in sight of the pass [???] of a way in [???] and if we can find it
now [???] then i suppose our agreement can be said to be over . you have done what
you promised [???] and you ' re free : free to go back to food and rest [???] wherever
you wish to go [???] except to servants of the enemy . and one day i may reward
you [???] i or those that remember me . '
` no [???] no [???] not yet [???] ' [???] whined . ` o no ! they can ' t find the way
themselves [???] can they ? o no indeed . there ' s the tunnel coming . [???] must
go on . no rest . no food . not yet . '




chapter 9 . [???] ' s lair



it may indeed have been [???] now [???] as [???] said [???] but the [???]
could see little difference [???] unless [???] perhaps [???] the heavy sky above was less
utterly black [???] more like a great roof of smoke ; while instead of the
darkness of deep night [???] which lingered still in cracks and holes [???] a grey
[???] shadow shrouded the stony world about them . they passed on [???]
[???]
in front and the [???] now side by side [???] up the long ravine between the
piers and [???] of torn and wea thered rock [???] standing like huge [???]
statues on either hand . there was no sound . some way ahead [???] a mile or so [???]
perhaps [???] was a great grey wall [???] a last huge [???] mass of
mountain - stone . darker it loomed [???] and steadily it rose as they approached [???]
until it towered up high above them [???] shutting out the view of all that lay
beyond . deep shadow lay before its feet . sam [???] the air .
` ugh ! that smell ! ' he said . ` it ' s getting stronger and stronger . '
presently they were under the shadow [???] and there in the midst of it they
saw the opening of a cave . ` this is the way in [???] ' said [???] softly . ` this
is the entrance to the tunnel . ' he did not speak its name : torech ungol [???]
[???] ' s lair . out of it came a stench [???] not the sickly odour of decay in the
meads of [???] [???] but a foul reek [???] as if filth [???] were piled and
hoarded in the dark within .
` is this the only way [???] [???] ? ' said [???] .
' yes [???] yes [???] ' he answered . ' yes [???] we must go this way now . '
' d ' you mean to say you ' ve been through this hole ? ' said sam . ` phew ! but
perhaps you don ' t mind bad smells . '
[???] ' s eyes glinted . ` he doesn ' t know what we minds [???] does he
precious ? no [???] he doesn ' t . but [???] can bear things . yes . he ' s been
through . o yes [???] right through . it ' s the only way . '
` and what makes the smell [???] i wonder [???] ' said sam . ` it ' s like - - well [???] i
wouldn ' t like to say . some beastly hole of the [???] [???] i ' ll warrant [???] with a
hundred years of their filth in it . '
' well [???] ' said [???] [???] ' [???] or no [???] if it ' s the only way [???] we must take
it . '
drawing a deep breath they passed inside . in a few steps they were in

utter and [???] dark . not since the lightless passages of moria had
[???] or sam known such darkness [???] and if possible here it was deeper and
denser . there [???] there were airs moving [???] and echoes [???] and a sense of space .
here the air was still [???] [???] [???] heavy [???] and sound fell dead . they walked as
it were in a black vapour wrought of veritable darkness itsel f that [???] as it
was breathed [???] brought blindness not only to the eyes but to the mind [???] so
that even the memory of colours and of forms and of any light faded out of
thought . night always had been [???] and always would be [???] and night was all .
but for a while they could still feel [???] and indeed the senses of their
feet and fingers at first seemed sharpened almost painfully . the walls felt [???]
to their surprise [???] smooth [???] and the floor [???] save for a step now and again [???] was
straight and even [???] going ever up at the same stiff slope . the tunnel was
high and wide [???] so wide that [???] though the [???] walked [???] [???] only
touching the side - walls with their [???] hands [???] they were separated [???]
cut off alone in the darkness .
[???] had gone in first and seemed to be only a few steps ahead . while
they were still able to give heed to such things [???] they could hear his breath
hissing and gasping just in front of them . but after a time their senses
became duller [???] both touch and hearing seemed to grow numb [???] and they kept on [???]
groping [???] walking [???] on and on [???] mainly by the force of the will with which they
had entered [???] will to go through and desire to come at last to the high gate
beyond .
before they had gone very far [???] perhaps [???] but time and distance soon
passed out of his reckoning [???] sam on the right [???] feeling the wall [???] was aware
that there was an opening at the side : for a moment he caught a faint breath
of some air less heavy [???] and then they passed it by .
' there ' s more than one passage here [???] ' he whispered with an effort : it
seemed hard to make his breath give any sound . ` it ' s as orc - like a place as
ever there could be ! '
after that [???] first he on the right [???] and then [???] on the left [???] passed
three or four such openings [???] some wider [???] some smaller ; but there was as yet
no doubt of the main way [???] for it was straight [???] and did not turn [???] and still
went steadily up . but how long was it [???] how much more of this would they have
to endure [???] or could they endure ? the breathlessness of the air was growing
as they climbed ; and now they seemed often in the blind dark to sense some
resistance thicker than the foul air . as they thrust forward they felt
things brush against their heads [???] or against their hands [???] long tentacles [???] or

hanging growths perhaps : they could not tell what they were . and still the
stench grew . it grew [???] until almost it seemed to them that smell was the only
clear sense left t [???] them . and that was for their torment . one hour [???] two
hours [???] three hours : how many had they passed in this lightless hole ?
hours - days [???] weeks rather . sam left the tunnel - side and shrank towards [???] [???]
and their hands met and clasped . and so together they still went on .
at length [???] [???] groping along the left - hand wall [???] came suddenly to a
void . almost he fell sideways into the emptiness . here was some opening in
the rock far wider than any they had yet passed ; and out of it came a reek
so foul [???] and a sense of lurking malice so intense [???] that [???] [???] . and at
that moment sam too lurched and fell forwards .
fighting off both the sickness and the fear [???] [???] gripped sam ' s hand .
` up ! ' he said in a hoarse breath without voice . ' it all comes from here [???]
the stench and the peril . now for it ! quick ! '
calling up his remaining strength and resolution [???] he dragged sam to his
feet [???] and forced his own limbs to move . sam [???] beside him . one step [???]
two steps [???] three steps - at last six steps . maybe they had passed the dreadful
unseen opening [???] but whether that was so or not [???] suddenly it was easier to
move [???] as if some hostile will for the moment had released them . they
struggled on [???] still hand in hand .
but almost at once they came to a new difficulty . the tunnel forked [???] or
so it seemed [???] and in the dark they could not tell wh ich was the wider way [???]
or which kept nearer to the straight . which should they take [???] the left [???] or
the right ? they knew of nothing to guide them [???] yet a false choice would
almost certainly be fatal .
` which way has [???] gone ? ' panted sam . ' and why didn ' t he wait ? '
` [???] ! ' said [???] [???] trying to call . ' [???] ! ' but his voice
croaked [???] and the name fell dead almost as it left his lips . there was no
answer [???] not an echo [???] not even a tremor of the air .
` he ' s really gone this time [???] i fancy [???] ' muttered sam . ` i guess this is
just exactly where he meant to bring us . [???] ! if ever i lay hands on you
again [???] you ' ll be sorry for it . '
presently [???] groping and fumbling in the dark [???] they found that the
opening on the left wa s blocked : either it was a blind [???] or else some great
stone had fallen in the passage . ' this can ' t be the way [???] ' [???] whispered .
' right or wrong [???] we must take the other . '
' and quick ! ' sam panted . ' there ' s something worse than [???] about . i

can feel something looking at us . '
they had not gone more than a few yards when from behind them came a
sound [???] startling and horrible in the heavy padded silence : a [???] [???]
[???] noise [???] and a long venomous hiss . they wheeled round [???] but nothing
could be seen . still as stones they stood [???] staring [???] waiting for they did not
know what .
` it ' s a trap ! ' said sam [???] and he laid his hand upon the hilt of his
sword ; and as he did so [???] he thought of the darkness of the barrow whence it
came . ' i wish old tom was near us now ! ' he thought . then as he stood [???]
darkness about him and a blackness of despair and anger in his heart . it
seemed to him that he saw a light : a light in his mind [???] almost [???]
bright at first [???] as a sun - ray to the eyes of one long hidden in a windowless
pit . then the light became colour : green [???] gold [???] silver [???] white . far off [???] as
in a little picture drawn by elven - fingers he saw the lady [???]
standing on the grass in [???] [???] and gifts were in her hands . and you [???]
ring - bearer [???] he heard her say [???] remote but clear [???] for you i have prepared
this .
the [???] hiss drew nearer [???] and there was a creaking as of some
great jointed thing that moved with slow purpose in the dark . a reek came on
before it . ' master [???] master ! ' cried sam [???] and the life and urgency came back
into his voice . ' the lady ' s gift ! the star - glass ! a light to you in dark
places [???] she said it was to be . the star - glass ! '
` the star - glass ? ' muttered [???] [???] as one answering out of sleep [???] hardly
[???] . ` why yes ! why had i forgotten it ? a light when all other
lights go out ! and now indeed light alone can help us . '
slowly his hand went to his bosom [???] and slowly he held aloft the phial
of [???] . for a moment it [???] [???] faint as a rising star struggling
in heavy earthward mists [???] and then as its power waxed [???] and hope grew in
[???] ' s mind [???] it began to burn [???] and kindled to a silver flame [???] a minute
heart of [???] light [???] as though [???] had himself come down from the
high sunset paths with the last [???] upon his brow . the darkness receded
from it until it seemed to shine in the centre of a globe of airy crystal [???]
and the hand that held it sparkled with white fire .
[???] gazed in wonder at this marvellous gift that he had so long
carried [???] not guessing its full worth and potency . seldom had he remembered
it on the road [???] until they came to [???] vale [???] and never had he used it for
fear of its revealing light . [???] [???] [???] [???] ! he cried [???] and

knew not what he had spoken ; for it seemed that another voice spoke through
his [???] clear [???] [???] by the foul air of the pit .
but other [???] there are in middle - earth [???] powers of night [???] and
they are old and strong . and she that walked in the darkness had heard the
elves cry that cry far back in the deeps of time [???] and she had not heeded it [???]
and it did not daunt her now . even as [???] spoke he felt a great malice
bent upon him [???] and a deadly regard considering him . not far down the tunnel [???]
between them and the opening where they had [???] and [???] [???] he was
aware of eyes growing visible [???] two great [???] of many - windowed eyes - -
the coming menace was [???] at last . the radiance of the star - gla ss was
broken and thrown back from their thousand facets [???] but behind the glitter a
pale deadly fire began steadily to glow within [???] a flame kindled in some deep
pit of evil thought . monstrous and abominable eyes they were [???] bestial and
yet filled with purpose and with hideous delight [???] gloating over their prey
trapped beyond all hope of escape .
[???] and sam [???] horror - [???] [???] began slowly to back away [???] their own
gaze held by the dreadful stare of those [???] eyes ; but as they backed so
the eyes advanced . [???] ' s hand wavered [???] and slowly the phial drooped . then
suddenly [???] released from the holding spell to run a little while in vain
panic for the [???] of the eyes [???] they both turned and fled together ; but
even as they ran [???] looked back and saw with terror that at once the eyes
came leaping up behind . the stench of death was like a cloud about him .
' stand ! stand ! ' he cried desperately . ` running is no use . '
slowly the eyes crept nearer .
` [???] ! ' he called [???] and gathering his courage he lifted up the
phial once more . the eyes halted . for a moment their regard [???] [???] as if
some hint of doubt troubled them . then [???] ' s heart flamed within him [???] and
without thinking what he did [???] whether it was folly or despair or courage [???] he
took the phial in his left hand [???] and with his right hand drew his sword .
sting flashed out [???] and the sharp elven - blade sparkled in the silver light [???]
but at its edges a blue fire [???] . then holding the star aloft and the
bright sword advanced [???] [???] [???] hobbit of the shire [???] walked steadily down to
meet the eyes .
they wavered . doubt came into them as the light approached . one by one
they dimmed [???] and slowly they drew back . no brightness so deadly had ever
afflicted them before . from sun and moon and star they had been safe
underground [???] but now a star had descended into the very earth . still it

approached [???] and the eyes began to quail . one by one they all went dark ; they
turned away [???] and a great bulk [???] beyond the light ' s reach [???] heaved its huge
shadow in between . they were gone .
' master [???] master ! ' cried sam . he was close behind [???] his own sword drawn
and ready . ' stars and glory ! but the elves would make a song of that [???] if
ever they heard of it ! and may i live to tell them and hear them sing . but
don ' t go on [???] master . don ' t go down to that den ! now ' s our only chance . now
let ' s get out of this foul hole ! '
and so back they turned once more [???] first walking and then running ; for
as they went the floor of the tunnel rose steeply [???] and with every stride
they climbed higher above the [???] of the unseen lair [???] and strength
returned to limb and heart . but still the hatred of the watcher lurked
behind them [???] blind for a while [???] perhaps [???] but [???] [???] still bent on
death . and now there came a flow of air to meet them [???] cold and thin . the
opening [???] the tunnel ' s end [???] at last it was before them . panting [???] yearning for
a roofless place [???] they flung themselves forward [???] and then in amazement they
[???] [???] tumbling back . the outlet was blocked with some barrier [???] but not
of stone : soft and a little yielding it seemed [???] and yet strong and
impervious ; air filtered through [???] hut not a glimmer of any light . once more
they charged and were hurled back .
holding aloft the phial [???] looked and before him he saw a greyness
which the radiance of the star - glass did not pierce and did not [???] [???]
as if it were a shadow that being cast by no light [???] no light could
[???] . across the width and height of the tunnel a vast web was spun [???]
orderly as the web of some huge spider [???] but denser - woven and far greater [???]
and each thread was as thick as rope .
sam laughed grimly . ` cobwebs ! ' he said . ` is that all ? cobwebs ! but
what a spider ! have at ' em [???] down with ' em ! '
in a fury he hewed at them with his sword [???] but the thread that he
struck did not break . it gave a little and then sprang back like a plucked
[???] [???] turning the blade and tossing up both sword and a rm . three times
sam struck with all his force [???] and at last one single cord of all the
countless cords snapped and twisted [???] curling and whipping through the air .
one end of it [???] sam ' s hand [???] and he cried out in pain [???] starting back and
drawing h is hand across his mouth .
` it will take days to clear the road like this [???] ' he said . ` what ' s to be
done ? have those eyes come back ? '

` no [???] not to be seen [???] ' said [???] . ` but i still feel that they are
looking at me [???] or thinking about me : making some other plan [???] perhaps . if
this light were lowered [???] or if it failed [???] they would quickly come again . '
` trapped in the end ! ' said sam bitterly [???] his anger rising again above
weariness and despair . ` gnats in a net . may the curse of [???] bite that
[???] and bite him quick ! '
' that would not help us now [???] ' said [???] . ` come ! let us see what sting
can do . it is an elven - blade . there were webs of horror in the dark ravines
of [???] where it was forged . but you must be the guard and hold back
the eyes . here [???] take the star - glass . do not be afraid . hold it up and
watch ! '
then [???] stepped up to the great grey net [???] and hewed it with a wide
sweeping stroke [???] drawing the bitter edge swiftly across a ladder of
close - strung cords [???] and at once springing away . the blue - gleaming blade
shore through them like a [???] through grass [???] and they leaped and [???]
and then hung loose . a great rent was made .
stroke after stroke he dealt [???] until at last all the web within his
reach was [???] [???] and the upper portion blew and swayed like a loose veil
in the [???] wind . the trap was broken .
` come ! ' cried [???] . ` on ! on ! ' wild joy at their escape from the very
mouth of despair suddenly filled all his mind . his head whirled as with a
draught of potent wine . he sprang out [???] shouting as he came .
it seemed light in that dark land to his eyes that had passed through
the den of night . the great smokes had risen and grown thinner [???] and the last
hours of a [???] day were passing ; the red glare of [???] had died away in
sullen gloom . yet it seemed to [???] that he looked upon a morning of sudden
hope . almost he had reached the summit of the wall . only a little higher
now . the cleft [???] [???] ungol [???] was before him [???] a dim notch in the black
ridge [???] and the horns of rock darkling in the sky on either side . a short
race [???] a sprinter ' s course and he would be through !
` the pass [???] sam ! ' he cried [???] not heeding the shrillness of his voice [???]
that released from the choking airs of the tunnel rang out now high and
wild . ' the pass ! run [???] run [???] and we ' ll be through - through before any one can
stop us ! '
sam came up behind as fast as he could urge his legs ; but glad as he
was to be free [???] he was uneasy [???] and as he ran [???] he kept on glancing back at
the dark arch of the tunnel [???] fearing to see eyes [???] or some shape beyond his

imagining [???] spring out in pursuit . too little did he or his master know of
the craft of [???] . she had many exits from her lair .
there agelong she had dwelt [???] an evil thing in spider - form [???] even such as
once of old had lived in the land of the elves in the west that is now under
the sea [???] such as beren fought in the mountains of terror in [???] [???] and so
came to l [???] thien upon the green sward amid the [???] in the moonlight
long
ago . how [???] came there [???] flying from ruin [???] no tale tells [???] for out of the
dark years few tales have come . but still she was there [???] who was there
before [???] [???] and before the first stone of barad - dyr ; and she served none
but herself [???] drinking the blood of elves and men [???] bloated and grown fat with
endless brooding on her feasts [???] weaving webs of shadow ; for all living
things were her food [???] and her vomit darkness . far and wide her lesser
broods [???] bastards of the miserable mates [???] her own [???] [???] that she slew [???]
spread from glen to glen [???] from the [???] d [???] ath to the eastern hills [???] to dol
[???] and the [???] of [???] . but none could rival her [???] [???] the
great [???] last child of [???] to trouble the unhappy world .
already [???] years before [???] [???] had beheld her [???] [???] who pried into
all dark holes [???] and in past days he had bowed and worshipped her [???] and the
darkness of her evil will walked through all the ways of his weariness
beside him [???] cutting him off from light and from regret . and he had promised
to bring her food . but her lust was not his lust . little she knew of or
cared for towers [???] or rings [???] or anything devised by mind or hand [???] who only
desired death for all others [???] mind and body [???] and for herself a glut of life .
alone [???] [???] till the mountains could no longer hold her up and the
darkness could not contain her .
but that desire was yet far away [???] and long now had she been hungry [???]
lurking in her den [???] while the power of [???] grew [???] and light and living
things forsook his borders ; and the city in the valley was dead [???] and no elf
or man came near [???] only the unhappy [???] . poor food and wary . but she must
eat [???] and however busily they delved new winding passages from the pass and
from their tower [???] ever she found some way to snare them . but she lusted for
sweeter meat . and [???] had brought it to her .
` we ' ll see [???] we ' ll see [???] ' he said often to himself [???] when the evil mood
was on him [???] as he walked the dangerous road from emyn muil to [???]
vale [???]
' we ' ll see . it may well be [???] o yes [???] it may well be that when she throws away

the bones and the empty garments [???] we shall find it [???] we shall get it [???] the
precious [???] a reward for poor [???] who brings nice food . and we ' ll save the
precious [???] as we promised . o yes . and when we ' ve got it safe [???] then she ' ll
know it [???] o yes [???] then we ' ll pay her back [???] my precious . then we ' ll pay
everyone back ! '
so he thought in an inner chamber of his cunning [???] which he still hoped
to hide from her [???] even when he had come to her again and had bowed low
before her while his companions slept .
and as for [???] : he knew where she lurked . it pleased him that she
should dwell there hungry but [???] in malice [???] a more sure watch upon
that ancient path into his land than any other that his skill could have
devised . and [???] [???] they were useful slaves [???] but he had them in plenty . if
now and again [???] caught them to stay her appetite [???] she was welcome : he
could spare them . and sometimes as a man may cast a dainty to his cat ( his
cat he calls her [???] but she owns him not ) [???] would send her prisoners that
he had no better uses for : he would have them driven to her hole [???] and report
brought back to him of the play she made .
so they both lived [???] delighting in their own devices [???] and feared no
assault [???] nor wrath [???] nor any end of their wickedness . never yet had any fly
escaped from [???] ' s webs [???] and the greater now was her rage and hunger .
but nothing of this evil which they had stirred up against them did
poor sam know [???] except that a fear was growing on him [???] a menace which he
could not see ; and such a weight did it become that it was a burden to him
to run [???] and his feet seemed leaden .
dread was round him [???] and enemies before him in the pass [???] and his master
was in a fey mood running [???] to meet them . turning his eyes away
from the shadow behind and the deep gloom beneath the cliff upon his left [???]
he looked ahead [???] and he saw two things that increased his dismay . he saw
that the sword which [???] still held [???] was glittering with blue
flame ; and he saw that though the sky behind was now dark . still the window
in the tower was g lowing red .
` [???] ! ' he muttered . ` we ' ll never rush it like this . there ' s [???]
about [???] and worse than [???] . ' then returning quickly to his long habit of
secrecy [???] he closed his hand about the precious phial which he still bore .
red with his own living blood his hand shone for a moment [???] and then he
thrust the revealing light deep into a pocket near his breast and drew his
elven - cloak about him . now he tried to quicken his pace . his master was

gaining on him ; already he was some twenty strides ahead [???] flitting on like a
shadow ; soon he would be lost to sight in that grey world .
hardly had sam hidden the light of the star - glass when she came . a
little way ahead and to his left he saw suddenly [???] issuing from a black hole
of shadow under the cliff [???] the most loathly shape that he had ever beheld [???]
horrible beyond the horror of an evil dream . most like a spider she was [???] but
huger than the great hunting beasts [???] and more terrible than they because of
the evil purpose in her remorseless eyes . those same eyes that he had
thought [???] and defeated [???] there they were lit with a fell light again [???]
[???] in her out - thrust head . great horns she had [???] and behind her short
stalk - like neck was her huge [???] body [???] a vast bloated bag [???] swaying and
sagging between her legs ; its great bulk was black [???] blotched with livid
marks [???] but the belly underneath was pale and [???] and gave forth a
stench . her legs were bent [???] with great [???] joints high above her back [???]
and hairs that stuck out like steel spines [???] and at each leg ' s end there was
a claw .
as soon as she had [???] her soft [???] body and its folded
limbs out of the upper exit from her lair [???] she moved with a horrible speed [???]
now running on her creaking legs [???] now making a sudden bound . she was
between
sam and his master . either she did not see sam [???] or she avoided him for the
moment as the bearer of the light ` and fixed all her intent upon one prey [???]
upon [???] [???] bereft of his phial [???] running heedless up the path [???] [???] yet
of his peril . swiftly he ran [???] but [???] was swifter ; in a few leaps she
would have him .
sam gasped and gathered all his remaining breath to shout . ' look out
behind ! ' he yelled . ' look out master ! i ' m ' - - but suddenly his cry was
[???] .
a long [???] hand went over his mouth and another caught him by the
neck [???] while something wrapped itself about his leg . taken off his guard he
toppled backwards into the arms of his attacker .
` got him ! ' [???] [???] in his ear . ` at last [???] my precious [???] we ' ve got
him [???] yes [???] the [???] hobbit . we takes this one . she ' ll get the other . o yes [???]
[???] will get him [???] not [???] : he promised ; he won ' t hurt master at all .
but he ' s got you [???] you [???] filthy little sneak ! ' he spat on sam ' s neck .
fury at the treachery [???] and desperation at the delay when his master was
in deadly peril [???] gave to sam a sudden violence and strength that was far

beyond anything that [???] had expected from this slow stupid hobbit [???] as he
thought him . not [???] himself could have twisted more quickly or more
fiercely . his hold on sam ' s mouth slipped [???] and sam ducked and lunged
forward
again [???] trying to tear away from the grip on his neck . his sword was still in
his hand [???] and on his left arm [???] hanging by its thong [???] was [???] ' s staff .
desperately he tried to turn and stab his enemy . but [???] was too quick .
his long right arm shot out [???] and he [???] sam ' s wrist : his fingers were
like a vice ; slowly and [???] he bent the hand down and forward [???] till
with a cry of pain sam released the sword and it fell to the ground ; and all
the while [???] ' s other hand was tightening on sam ' s throat .
then sam played his last trick . with all his strength he pulled away
and got his feet firmly planted ; then suddenly he drove his legs against the
ground and with his whole force hurled himself backwards .
not expecting even this simple trick from sam [???] [???] fell over with
sam on top [???] and he received the weight of the [???] hobbit in his stomach .
a sharp hiss came out of him [???] and for a second his hand upon sam ' s throat
loosened ; but his fingers still gripped the sword - hand . sam tore himself
forward and away [???] and stood up [???] and then quickly he wheeled away to his
right [???] [???] on the wrist held by [???] . laying hold of the staff with
his left hand [???] sam swung it up [???] and down it came with a whistling crack on
[???] ' s [???] arm [???] just below the elbow .
with a squeal [???] let go . then sam waded in ; not waiting to change
the staff from left to right he dealt another savage blow . quick as a snake
[???] [???] aside . and the stroke aimed at his head fell across his
back . the staff cracked and broke . that was enough for him . [???] from
behind was an old game of his [???] and seldom had he failed in it . but this
time [???] misled by spite [???] he had made the mistake of speaking and gloating
before he had both hands on his victim ' s neck . everything had gone wrong
with his beautiful plan [???] since that horrible light had so [???]
appeared in the darkness . and now he was face to face with a furious enemy [???]
little less than his own size . this fight was not for him . sam swept up his
sword from the ground and raised it . [???] [???] [???] and springing aside on
to all fours [???] he jumped away in one big bound like a frog . before sam could
reach him [???] he was off [???] running with amazing speed back towards the tunnel .
sword in hand sam went after him . for the moment he had forgotten
everything else but the red fury in his brain and the desire to kill [???] .

but before he could overtake him [???] [???] was gone . then as the dark hole
stood before him and the stench came out to meet him [???] like a clap of thunder
the thought of [???] and the monster smote upon sam ' s mind . he spun round [???]
and rushed wildly up the path [???] calling and calling his master ' s name . he was
too late . so far [???] ' s plot had succeeded .




chapter 10 . the choices of master [???]



[???] was lying face upward on the ground and the monster was bending
over him [???] so intent upon her victim that she took no heed of sam and his
cries [???] until he was close at hand . as he rushed up he saw that [???] was
already bound in cords [???] wound about him from ankle to shoulder [???] and the
monster with her great [???] was beginning half to lift [???] half to drag his
body away .
on the near side of him lay [???] gleaming on the ground [???] his elven - blade [???]
where it had fallen useless from his grasp . sam did not wait to wonder wha t
was to be done [???] or whether he was brave [???] or loyal [???] or filled with rage . he
sprang forward with a yell [???] and seized his master ' s sword in his left hand .
then he charged . no [???] more fierce was ever seen in the savage world
of beasts ; where some desperate small creature armed with little teeth
alone [???] will spring upon a tower of horn and hide that stands above its
fallen mate .
disturbed as if out of some gloating dream by his small yell she turned
slowly the dreadful malice of her glance upon him . but almost before she was
aware that a fury was upon her greater than any she had known in countless
years [???] the shining sword bit upon her foot and shore away the claw . sam
sprang in [???] inside the arches of her legs [???] and with a quick [???] of his
other hand stabbed at the [???] eyes upon her lowered head . one great
eye went dark .
now the miserable creature was right under her [???] for the moment out of
the reach of her sting and of her claws . her vast belly was above him with
its putrid light [???] and the stench of it almost smote him down . still his fury
held for one more blow [???] and before she could sink upon him [???] smothering him
and all his little impudence of courage [???] he [???] the bright elven - blade
across her with desperate strength .
but [???] was not as dragons are [???] no softer spot had she save only her
eyes . [???] and pitted with corruption was her age - old hide [???] but ever
thickened from within with layer on layer of evil growth . the blade scored
it with a dreadful gash [???] but those hideous folds could not be pierced by any
strength of men [???] not though elf or dwarf should forge the steel or the hand
of beren or of t [???] rin wield it . she yielded to the stroke [???] and then heaved up

the great bag of her belly high above sam ' s head . poison frothed and [???]
from the wound . now [???] her legs she drove her huge bulk down on
him
again . too soon . for sam still stood upon his feet [???] and dropping his own
sword [???] with both hands he held the elven - blade point upwards [???] [???] off
that ghastly roof ; and so [???] [???] with the driving force of her own cruel
will [???] with strength greater than any warrior ' s hand [???] thrust herself upon a
bitter spike . deep [???] deep it pricked [???] as sam was crushed slowly to the
ground .
no such anguish had [???] ever known [???] or dreamed of knowing [???] in all
her long world of wickedness . not the [???] soldier of old [???] [???] nor
the most savage orc entrapped [???] had ever thus endured her [???] or set blade to
her beloved flesh . a shudder went through her . heaving up again [???] wrenching
away from the pain [???] she bent her [???] limbs beneath her and sprang
backwards in a [???] leap .
sam had fallen to his knees by [???] ' s head [???] his senses [???] in the
foul stench [???] his two hands still gripping the hilt of the sword . through the
mist before his eyes he was aware dimly of [???] ' s face and stubbornly he
fought to master himself and to drag himself out of the swoon that was upon
him . slowly he raised his head and saw her [???] only a few paces away [???] eyeing
him [???] her beak [???] a spittle of venom [???] and a green ooze trickling from
below her wounded eye . there she [???] [???] her [???] belly [???]
upon
the ground [???] the great bows of her legs [???] [???] as she gather ed herself
for another spring - this time to crush and sting to death : no little bite of
poison to still the struggling of her meat ; this time to slay and then to
rend .
even as sam himself [???] [???] looking at her [???] seeing his death in her
eyes [???] a thought came to him [???] as if some remote voice had spoken . and he
[???] in his breast with his left hand [???] and found what he sought : cold and
hard and solid it seemed to his touch in a [???] world of horror [???] the
phial of [???] .
' [???] iel ! ' he said faintly [???] and then he heard voices far off but
clear : the crying of the elves as they walked under the stars in the beloved
shadows of the shire [???] and the music of the elves as it came through his
sleep in the hall of fire in the house of [???] .
[???] a [???] !

and then his tongue was loosed and his voice cried in a language which
he did not know :
a [???] [???]
o menel palan - [???] [???]
le [???] sn di ' [???] !
a tiro nin [???] [???] !
and with that he [???] to his feet and was [???] the hobbit [???]
hamfast ' s son [???] again .
` now come [???] you filth ! ' he cried . ` you ' ve hurt my master [???] you brute [???] and
you ' ll pay for it . we ' re going on ; but we ' ll settle with you first . come on [???]
and taste it again ! '
as if his [???] spirit had set its potency in motion [???] the glass
blazed suddenly like a white torch in his hand . it flamed like a star that
leaping from the firmament sears the dark air with intolerable light . no
such terror out of heaven had ever burned in [???] ' s face before . the beams
of it entered into her wounded head and scored it with [???] pain [???] and
the dreadful infection of light spread from eye to eye . she fell back
beating the air with her [???] [???] her sight blasted by inner lightnings [???]
her mind in agony . then turning her [???] head away [???] she rolled aside and
began to [???] [???] claw by claw [???] towards the opening in the dark cliff behind .
sam came on . he was [???] like a drunken man [???] but he came on . and
[???] cowed at last [???] [???] in defeat [???] jerked and [???] as she tried
to hasten from him . she reached the hole [???] and [???] down [???] leaving a
trail of green - yellow slime [???] she slipped in [???] even as sam hewed a last stroke
at her dragging legs . then he fell to the ground .
[???] was gone ; and whether she lay long in her lair [???] nursing her
malice and her misery [???] and in slow years of darkness healed herself from
within [???] [???] her [???] eyes [???] until with hunger like death she spun
once more her dreadful snares in the glens of the mountains of shadow [???] this
tale does not tell .
sam was left alone . wearily [???] as the evening of the nameless land fell
upon the place of battle [???] he [???] back to his master .
' master [???] dear master [???] ' he said [???] but [???] did not speak . as he had run
forward [???] eager [???] rejoicing to be free [???] [???] with hideous speed had come
behind and with one swift stroke had stung him in the neck . he lay now pale [???]
and heard no voice . and did not move .
` master [???] dear master ! ' said sam [???] and through a long silence waited .

listening in vain .
then as quickly as he could he cut away the binding cords and laid his
head upon [???] ' s breast and to his mouth [???] but no stir of life could he
find [???] nor feel the faintest flutter of the heart . often he chafed his
master ' s hands and feet [???] and touched his brow [???] but all were cold .
` [???] [???] mr . [???] ! ' he called . ' don ' t leave me here alone ! it ' s your
sam calling . don ' t go where i can ' t follow ! wake up [???] mr . [???] ! o wake up [???]
[???] [???] me dear [???] me dear . wake up ! '
then anger surged over hint [???] and he ran about his master ' s body in a
rage [???] stabbing the air [???] and smiting the stones [???] and shouting challenges .
presently he came back [???] and bending looked at [???] ' s face [???] pale beneath him
in the [???] . and suddenly he saw that he was in the picture that was
revealed to him in the mirror of [???] in [???] : [???] with a pale face
lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff . or fast asleep he had thought
then . ` he ' s dead ! ' he said . ' not asleep [???] dead ! ' and as he said it [???] as if
the words had set the venom to its work again . it seemed to him that the hue
of the face grew livid green .
and then black despair came down on him [???] and sam bowed to the ground [???]
and drew his grey hood over his head [???] and night came into his heart [???] and he
knew no more .
when at last the blackness passed [???] sam looked up and shadows were about
him ; but for how many minutes or hours the world had gone dragging on he
could not tell . he was still in the same place [???] and still his master lay
beside him dead . the mountains had not [???] nor the earth fallen into
ruin .
' what shall i do [???] what shall i do ? ' he said . ` did i come all this way
with h im for nothing ? ' and then he remembered his own voice speaking
words
that at the time he did not understand himself [???] at the beginning of their
journey : i have something to do before the end . i must see it through [???] sir [???]
if you understand .
` but what can i do ? not leave mr . [???] dead [???] [???] on the top of
the mountains [???] and go home ? or go on ? go on ? ' he repeated [???] and for a
moment
doubt and fear shook him . ` go on ? is that what i ' ve got to do ? and leave
him ? '
then at last he began to weep ; and going to [???] he composed his body [???]

and folded his cold hands upon his breast [???] and wrapped his cloak about him ;
and he laid his own sword at one side [???] and the staff that [???] had given
at the other .
' if i ' m to go on [???] ' he said [???] ` then i must take your sword [???] by your
leave [???] mr . [???] [???] but i ' ll put this one to lie by you [???] as it lay by the old
king in the barrow ; and you ' ve got your beautiful [???] coat from old mr .
[???] . and your star - glass [???] mr . [???] [???] you did lend it to me and i ' ll need
it [???] for i ' ll be always in the dark now . it ' s too good for me [???] and the lady
gave it to you [???] but maybe she ' d understand . do you understand [???] mr . [???] ?
i ' ve got to go on . '
but he could not go [???] not yet . he knelt and held [???] ' s hand and could
not release it . and time went by and still he knelt [???] holding his master ' s
hand [???] and in his heart keeping a debate .
now he tried to find strength to tear himself away and go on a lonely
journey - - for vengeance . if once he could go [???] his anger would bear him down
all the roads of the world [???] pursuing [???] until he had him at last : [???] . then
[???] would die in a corner . but that was not what he had set out to do . it
would not be worth while to leave his master for that . it would not bring
him back . nothing would . they had better both be dead together . and that too
would be a lonely journey .
he looked on the bright point of the sword . he thought of the places
behind where there was a black brink and an empty fall into nothingness .
there was no escape that way . that was to do nothing [???] not even to grieve .
that was not what he had set out to do . ' what am i to do then ? ' he cried
again [???] and now he seemed plainly to know the hard answer : see it through .
another lonely journey [???] and the worst .
` what ? me [???] alone [???] go to the crack of doom and all ? ' he [???] still [???]
but the resolve grew . ` what ? me take the ring from him ? the council gave it
to him . '
but the answer came at once : ` and the council gave him companions [???] so
that the errand should not fail . and you are the last of all the company .
the errand must not fail . '
` i wish i wasn ' t the last [???] ' he groaned . ` i wish old [???] was hare or
somebody . why am i left all alone to make up my mind ? i ' m sure to go wrong .
and it ' s not for me to go taking the ring [???] putting myself forward . '
' but you haven ' t put yourself forward ; you ' ve been put forward . and as
for not being the right and proper person [???] why [???] mr . [???] wasn ' t as you

might say [???] nor mr . [???] . they didn ' t choose themselves . '
` ah well [???] i must make up my own mind . i will make it up . but i ' ll be
sure to go wrong : that ' d be sam [???] all over .
' let me see now : if we ' re found here [???] or mr . [???] ' s found [???] and that
thing ' s on him [???] well [???] the enemy will get it . and that ' s the end of all of
us [???] of [???] [???] and [???] [???] and the shire and all . and there s no time to
lose [???] or it ' ll be the end anyway . the war ' s begun [???] and more than likely
things are all going the enemy ' s way already . no chance to go back with it
and get advice or permission . no [???] it ' s sit here till they come and kill me
over master ' s body [???] and gets it : or take it and go . ' he drew a deep breath .
' then take it [???] it is ! '
he stooped . very gently he undid the clasp at the neck and slipped his
hand inside [???] ' s tunic ; then with his other hand raising the head [???] he
kissed the cold forehead [???] and softly drew the chain over it . and then the
head lay quietly back again in rest . no change came over the still face [???] and
by that more than by all other tokens sam was convinced at last that [???]
had died and laid aside the quest .
` good - bye [???] master [???] my dear ! ' he murmured . ' forgive your sam . he ' ll
come back to this spot when the job ' s done - - if he manages it . and then
he ' ll not leave you again . rest you quiet till i come ; and may no foul
creature come anigh you ! and if the lady could hear me and give me one wish [???]
i would wish to come back and find you again . good - bye ! '
and then he bent his own neck and put the chain upon it [???] and at once
his head was bowed to the ground with the weight of the ring [???] as if a great
stone had been strung on him . but slowly [???] as if the weight became less [???] or
new strength grew in him [???] he raised his head [???] and then with a great effort
got to his feet and found that he could walk and bear his burden . and for a
moment he lifted up the phial and looked down at his master [???] and the light
burned gently now with the soft radiance of the evening - star in summer [???] and
in that light [???] ' s face was fair of hue again [???] pale but beautiful with an
elvish beauty [???] as of one who has long passed the shadows . and with the
bitter comfort of that last sight sam turned and hid the light and [???]
on into the growing dark .
he had not far to go . the tunnel was some way behind ; the cleft a
couple of hundred yards ahead [???] or less . the path was visible in the [???] ` a
deep rut worn in ages of passage [???] running now gently up in a long trough
with cliffs on either side . the trough narrowed rapidly . soon sam came to a

long flight of broad shallow steps . now the orc - tower was right above him [???]
frowning black [???] and in it the red eye glowed . now he was hidden in the dark
shadow under it . he was coming to the top of the steps and was in the cleft
at last .
' i ' ve made up my mind [???] ' he kept saying to himself . but he had not .
though he had done his best to think it out [???] what he was doing was
altogether against the grain of his nature . ` have i got it wrong ? ' he
muttered . ` what ought i to have done ? '
as the sheer sides of the cleft closed about him [???] before he reached the
actual summit [???] before he looked at last on the path descending into the
nameless land . he turned . for a moment [???] motionless in intolerable doubt [???] he
looked back . he could still see [???] like a small blot in the gathering gloom [???]
the mouth of the tunnel ; and he thought he could see or guess where [???]
lay . he fancied there was a glimmer on the ground down there [???] or perhaps it
was some trick of his tears [???] as he peered out at that high stony place where
all his life had fallen in ruin .
' if only i could have my wish [???] my one wish [???] ' he sighed [???] ` to go back and
find him ! ' then at last he turned to the road in front and took a few
steps : the heaviest and the most [???] he had ever taken .
only a few steps ; and now only a few more and he would be going down
and would never see that high place again . and then suddenly he heard cries
and voices . he stood still as stone . orc - voices . they were behind him and
before him . a noise of tramping feet and harsh shouts : [???] were coming up
to the cleft from the far side [???] from some entry to the tower [???] perhaps .
tramping feet and shouts behind . he wheeled round . he saw small red lights [???]
torches [???] winking away below there as they issued from the tunnel . at last
the hunt was up . the red eye of the tower had not been blind . he was caught .
now the [???] of approaching torches and the clink of steel ahead was
very near . in a minute they would reach the top and be on him . he had taken
too long in making up his mind [???] and now it was no good . how could he escape [???]
or save himself [???] or save the ring ? the ring . he was not aware of any thought
or decision . he simply found himself drawing out the chain and taking the
ring in his hand . the head of the orc - company appeared in the cleft right
before him . then he put it on .
the world changed [???] and a single moment of time was filled with an hour
of thought . at once he was aware that hearing was sharpened while sight was
dimmed [???] but otherwise than in [???] ' s lair . all things about him now were

not dark but vague ; while he himself was there in a grey hazy world [???] alone [???]
like a small black solid rock and the ring [???] weighing down his left hand [???] was
like an orb of hot gold . he did not feel invisible at all [???] but horribly and
[???] visible ; and he knew that somewhere an eye was searching for him .
he heard the crack of stone [???] and the murmur of water far off in [???]
vale ; and down away under the rock the [???] misery of [???] [???] groping [???]
lost in some blind passage ; and voices in the dungeons of the tower ; and the
cries of the [???] as they came out of the tunnel ; and deafening [???] roaring in
his ears [???] the crash of the feet a nd the rending clamour of the [???] before
him . he shrank against the cliff . but they marched up like a [???]
company [???] grey distorted figures in a mist [???] only dreams of fear with pale
flames in their hands . and they passed him by . he cowered [???] trying to creep
away into some cranny and to hide .
he listened . the [???] from the tunnel and the others marching down had
sighted one another [???] and both parties were now hurrying and shouting . he
heard them both clearly [???] and he understood what they said . perhaps the ring
gave understanding of tongues [???] or simply understanding [???] especially of the
servants of [???] its maker [???] so that if he gave heed [???] he understood and
translated the thought to himself . certainly the ring had grown greatly in
power as it approached the places of its forging ; but one thing it did not
confer [???] and that was courage . at present sam still thought only of hiding [???]
of lying low till all was quiet again ; and he listened anxiously . he could
not tell how near the voices were [???] the words seemed almost in his ears .
' hola ! [???] ! what are you doing up here ? had enough of war already ? '
' orders [???] you lubber . and what are you doing [???] [???] ? tired of lurking
up there ? thinking of coming down to fight ? '
' orders to you . i ' m in command of this pass . so speak civil . what ' s
your report ? '
' nothing . '
` hai ! hai ! yoi ! ' a yell broke into the exchanges of the leaders . the
[???] lower down had suddenly seen something . they began to run . so did the
others .
` hai ! hola ! here ' s something ! lying right in the road . a spy [???] a spy ! '
there was a hoot of [???] horns and a babel of baying voices .
with a dreadful stroke sam was wakened from his cowering mood . they
had
seen his master . what would they do ? he had heard tales of the [???] to make

the blood run cold . it could not be borne . he sprang up . he flung the quest
and all his [???] away [???] and fear and doubt with them . he knew now where
his place was and had been : at his master ' s side [???] though what he could do
there was not clear . back he ran down the steps [???] down the path towards
[???] .
` how many are there ? ' he thought . ` thirty or forty from the tower at
least [???] and a lot more than that from down below [???] i guess . how many can i
kill before they get me ? they ' ll see the flame of the sword [???] as soon as i
draw it [???] and they ' ll get me sooner or later . i wonder if any song will ever
mention it : how [???] fell in the high pass and made a wall of bodies
round his master . no [???] no song . of course not [???] for the ring ' ll be found [???] and
there ' ll be no more songs . i can ' t help it . my place is by mr . [???] . they
must understand that - - [???] and the council [???] and the great lords and
ladies with all their wisdom . their plans have gone wrong . i can ' t be their
ring - bearer . not without mr . [???] . '
but the [???] were out of his dim sight now . he had had no time to
consider himself [???] but now he realized that he was weary [???] weary almost to
exhaustion : his legs would not carry him as he wished . he was too slow . the
path seemed miles long . where had they all got to in the mist ?
there they were again ! a good way ahead still . a [???] of figures
round something lying on the ground ; a few seemed to be darting this way and
that [???] bent like dogs on a trail . he tried to make a spurt .
' come on [???] sam ! ' he said [???] ` or you ' ll be too late again . ' he loosened
the sword in its sheath . in a minute he would draw it [???] and then - -
there was a wild clamour [???] hooting and laughing [???] as something was lifted
from the ground . ' ya hoi ! ya harri hoi ! up ! up ! '
then a voice shouted : ` now off ! the quick way . back to the undergate !
she ' ll not trouble us tonight by all the signs . ' the whole band of
orc - figures began to move . four in the middle were carrying a body high on
their shoulders . ` ya hoi ! '
they had taken [???] ' s body . they were off . he could not catch them up .
still he laboured on . the [???] reached the tunnel and were passing in . those
with the burden went first [???] and behind them there was a good deal of
struggling and [???] . sam came on . he drew the sword [???] a [???] of blue
in his wavering hand [???] but they did not see it . even as he came panting up [???]
the last of them vanished into the black hole .
for a moment he stood [???] gasping [???] clutching his breast . then he drew his

sleeve across his face [???] wiping away the grime [???] and sweat [???] and tears . ' curse
the filth ! ' he said [???] and sprang after them into the darkness .
it no longer seemed very dark to him in the tunnel [???] rather it was as if
he had stepped out of a thin mist into a heavier fog . his weariness was
growing but his will hardened all the more . he thought he could see the
light of torches a little way ahead [???] but try as he would [???] he could not catch
them up . [???] go fast in [???] [???] and this tunnel they knew well . ; for in
spite of [???] they were forced to use it often as the swiftest way from
the dead city over the mountains . in what far - off time the main tunnel and
the great round pit had been made [???] where [???] had taken up her [???] in
ages past . they did not know : but many byways they had themselves delved
about in on either side [???] so as to escape the lair in their goings to and fro
on the business of their masters . tonight they did not intend to go far
down . but were hastening to find a side - passage that led back to their
watch - tower on the cliff . must of them were [???] [???] delighted with what
they had found and seen [???] and as they ran they [???] and [???] after the
fashion of their kind . sam heard the noise of their harsh voices [???] flat and
hard in the dead air [???] and he could distinguish two voices from among all the
rest : they were louder [???] and nearer to him . the captains of the two parties
seemed to be bringing up the rear [???] debating as they went .
' can ' t you stop your rabble making such a racket [???] [???] ? ' [???]
the one . ` we don ' t want [???] on us . '
` go on [???] [???] ! yours are making more than half the noise [???] ' said the
other . ` but let the lads play ! no need to worry about [???] for a bit [???] i
reckon . she ' s sat on a nail [???] it seems [???] and we shan ' t cry about that . didn ' t
you see : a [???] mess all the way back to that cursed crack of hers ? if
we ' ve stopped it once [???] we ' ve stopped it a hundred times . so let ' em laugh .
and we ' ve struck a bit of luck at last : got something that [???] [???] rz wants . '
' [???] [???] rz wants it [???] eh ? what is it [???] d ' you think ? elvish it looked to me [???]
but [???] . what ' s the danger in a thing like that ? '
' don ' t know till we ' ve had a look . '
' oho ! so they haven ' t told you what to expect ? they don ' t tell us all
they know [???] do they ? not by half . but they can make mistakes [???] even the top
ones can . '
` sh [???] [???] ! ' [???] ' s voice was lowered [???] so tha t even with his
strangely sharpened hearing sam could only just catch what was said . ' they
may [???] but they ' ve got eyes and ears everywhere ; some among my lot [???] as like as

not . but there ' s no doubt about it [???] they ' re troubled about something . the
[???] down below are [???] by your account ; and [???] [???] rz is too . something
nearly
slipped . '
` nearly [???] you say ! ' said [???] .
` all right [???] ' said [???] [???] ` but we ' ll talk of that later : wait till we
get to the under - way . there ' s a place there where we can talk a bit [???] while
the lads go on . '
shortly afterwards sam saw the torches disappear . then there was a
rumbling noise [???] and just as he hurried up [???] a bump . as far as he could guess
the [???] had turned and gone into the very opening which [???] and he had
tried and found blocked . it was still blocked .
there seemed to be a great stone in the way [???] but the [???] had got
through somehow [???] for he could hear their voices on the other side . they were
still running along [???] deeper and deeper into the mountain [???] back towards the
tower . sam felt desperate . they were carrying off his master ' s body for some
foul purpose and he could not follow . he thrust and pushed at the block [???] and
he threw himself against it [???] but it did not yield . then not far inside [???] or
so he thought [???] he heard the two captains ' voices talking again . he stood
still listening for a little hoping perhaps to learn something useful .
perhaps [???] [???] who seemed to belong to minas [???] [???] would come out [???] and
he
could then slip in .
` no [???] i don ' t know [???] ' said [???] ' s voice . ` the messages go through
quicker than anything could fly [???] as a rule . but i don ' t enquire how it ' s
done . safest not to . grr ! those [???] give me the creeps . and they skin the
body off you as soon as look at you [???] and leave you all cold in the dark on
the other side . but he likes ' em ; they ' re his favourites [???] [???] so it ' s
no use grumbling . i tell you [???] it ' s no game serving down in the city . '
` you should try being up here with [???] for company [???] ' said [???] .
' i ' d like to try somewhere where there ' s none of ' em . but the war ' s on
now [???] and when that ' s over things may be easier . '
` it ' s going well [???] they say . '
' they would . ' [???] [???] . ` we ' ll see . but anyway [???] if it does go
well [???] there should be a lot more room . what d ' you say ? - - if we get a
chance [???] you and me ' ll slip off and set up somewhere on our own with a few
trusty lads [???] somewhere where there ' s good loot nice and handy [???] and no big

bosses . '
' ah ! ' said [???] . ` like old times . '
` yes [???] ' said [???] . ' but don ' t count on it . i ' m not easy in my mind . as
i said [???] the big bosses [???] ay [???] ' his voice sank almost to a whisper [???] ` ay [???] even
the [???] [???] can make mistakes . something nearly slipped you say . i say [???]
something has slipped . and we ' ve got to look out . always the poor [???] to
put slips right [???] and small thanks . but don ' t forget : the enemies don ' t love
us any more than they love him [???] and if they get topsides on him [???] we ' re done
too . but see here : when were you ordered out ? '
` about an hour ago [???] just before you saw us . a message came : [???]
uneasy . spies feared on stairs . double [???] . patrol to head of stairs .
i came at once . '
' bad business [???] ' said [???] . ` see here - - our silent watchers were
uneasy more than two days ago . that i know . but my patrol wasn ' t ordered out
for another day [???] nor any message sent to [???] [???] rz either : owing to the great
signal going up [???] and the high [???] going off to the war [???] and all that . and
then they couldn ' t get [???] [???] rz to pay attention for a good while [???] i ' m told . '
` the eye was busy elsewhere [???] i suppose [???] ' said [???] . ` big things
going on away west [???] they say . '
' i daresay [???] ' growled [???] . ` but in the meantime enemies have got up
the stairs . and what were you up to ? you ' re supposed to keep watch [???] aren ' t
you [???] special orders or no ? what are you for ? '
` that ' s enough ! don ' t try and teach me my job . we were awake all right .
we knew there were funny things going on . '
` very funny ! '
` yes [???] very funny : lights and shouting and all . but [???] was on the
go . my lads saw her and her sneak . '
` her sneak ? what ' s that ? '
` you must have seen him : little thin black fellow ; like a spider
himself [???] or perhaps more lik e a starved frog . he ' s been here before . came
out of [???] [???] rz the first time [???] years ago [???] and we had word from high up to
let him pass . he ' s been up the stairs once or twice since then [???] but we ' ve
left him alone : seems to have some understanding with her ladyship . i
suppose he ' s no good to eat : she wouldn ' t worry about words from high up .
but a fine guard you keep in the valley : he was up here a day before all
this racket . early last night we saw him . anyway my lads reported that her
ladyship was having some fun [???] and that seemed good enough for me [???] until the

message came . i thought her sneak had brought her a toy . or that you ' d
perhaps sent her a present [???] a prisoner of war or something . i don ' t
[???] when she ' s pla ying . nothing gets by [???] when she ' s on the
hunt . '
' nothing [???] say you ! didn ' t you use your eyes back there ? i tell you i ' m
not easy in my mind . whatever came up the stairs [???] did get by . it cut her web
and got clean out of the hole . that ' s something to think about ! '
` ah well [???] but she got him in the end [???] didn ' t she ? '
` got him ? got who ? this little fellow ? but if he was the only one then
she ' d have had him off to her larder long before [???] and there he ' d be now . and
if [???] [???] rz wanted him [???] you ' d have to go and get him . nice for you . but there
was more than one . '
at this point sam began to listen more attentively and pressed his ear
against the stone .
' who cut the cords she ' d put round him [???] [???] ? same one as cut the
web . didn ' t you see that ? and who stuck a pin into her ladyship ? same one [???] i
reckon . and where is he ? where is he [???] [???] ? '
[???] made no reply .
` you may well put your thinking cap on [???] if you ' ve got one . it ' s no
laughing matter . no one [???] no one has ever stuck a pin in [???] before [???] as
you should know well enough . there ' s no grief in that ; but think - there ' s
someone loose hereabouts as is more dangerous than any other damned rebel
that ever walked since the bad old times [???] since the great siege . something
has slipped . '
` and what is it then ? ' growled [???] .
` by all the signs [???] captain [???] [???] i ' d say there ' s a large warrior
loose [???] elf most likely [???] with an elf - sword anyway [???] and an axe as well maybe :
and he ' s loose in your bounds [???] too [???] and you ' ve never spotted him . very funny
indeed ! ' [???] spat . sam smiled grimly at this description of himself .
' ah well [???] you always did take a gloomy view . ' said [???] . ' you can
read the signs how you like [???] but there may be other ways to explain them .
anyhow . i ' ve got watchers at every point [???] and i ' m going to deal with one
thing at a time . when i ' ve had a look at the fellow we have caught [???] then
i ' ll begin to worry

[???]


about something else . '
` it ' s my guess you won ' t find much in that little fellow [???] ' said [???] .
' he may have had nothing to do with the real mischief . the big fellow with
the sharp sword doesn ' t seem to have thought him worth much anyhow - - just
left him lying : regular elvish trick . '
` we ' ll see . come on now ! we ' ve talked enough . let ' s go and have a look
at the prisoner !
` what are you going to do with him ? don ' t forget i spotted him first .
if there ' s any game [???] me and my lads must be in it . '
' now [???] now [???] ' growled [???] . ' i have my orders . and it ' s more than my
belly ' s worth [???] or yours [???] to break ' em . any trespasser found by the guard is
to be held at the tower . prisoner is to be stripped . full description of
every article [???] garment [???] weapon [???] letter [???] ring . or [???] is to be sent to
[???] [???] rz at once [???] and to [???] [???] rz only . and the prisoner is to be kept safe
and intact [???] under pain of death for every member of the guard [???] until he
sends or comes himself . that ' s plain enough [???] and that ' s what i ' m going to
do . '
' stripped [???] eh ? ' said [???] . ' what [???] teeth [???] nails [???] hair [???] and all ? '
` no [???] none of that . he ' s for [???] [???] rz [???] i tell you . he ' s wanted safe and
whole . '
' you ' ll find that difficult [???] ' laughed [???] . ' he ' s nothing but carrion
now . what [???] [???] rz will do with such stuff i can ' t guess . he might as well go
in the pot . '
' you fool [???] ' [???] [???] . ' you ' ve been talking very clever [???] but
there ' s a lot you don ' t know [???] though most other folk do . you ' ll be for the
pot or for [???] [???] if you don ' t take care . carrion ! is that all you know of
her ladyship ? when she binds with cords [???] she ' s after meat . she doesn ' t eat
dead meat [???] nor suck cold blood . this fellow isn ' t dead ! '
sam [???] [???] clutching at the stone . he felt as if the whole dark world
was turning upside down . so great was the shock that he almost swooned [???] but
even as he fought to keep a hold on his senses [???] deep inside him he was aware
of the comment : ' you fool [???] he isn ' t dead [???] and your heart knew it . don ' t
trust your head [???] [???] [???] it is not the best part of you . the trouble with
you is that you never really had any hope . now what is to be done ? ' fur the
moment nothing [???] but to prop himself against the [???] stone and listen [???]
listen to the vile orc - voices .
` garn ! ' said [???] . ' she ' s got more than one poison . when she ' s

hunting [???] she just gives ' em a dab in the neck and they go as limp as boned
fish [???] and then she has her way with them . d ' you remember old [???] ? we lost
him for days . then we found him in a corner ; hanging up he was [???] but he was
wide awake and glaring . how we laughed ! she ' d forgotten him [???] maybe [???] but
we
didn ' t touch him - no good [???] with her . nar - - this little filth [???]
he ' ll wake up [???] in a few hours ; and beyond feeling a bit sick for a hit [???]
he ' ll be all right . or would be [???] if [???] [???] rz would let him alone . and of
course [???] beyond wondering where he is and what ' s happened to him . '
' and what ' s going to happen to him [???] ' laughed [???] . ' we can tell him a
few stories at any rate [???] if we can ' t do a [???] else . i don ' t suppose he ' s
ever been in lovely [???] [???] rz [???] so he may like to know what to expect . this is
going to be more funny than i thought . let ' s go ! '
` there ' s going to be no fun [???] i tell you [???] ' said [???] . ' and he ' s got
to be kept safe [???] or we ' re all as good as dead . '
` aii right ! but if i were you [???] i ' d catch the big one that ' s loose [???]
before you send in any report to [???] [???] rz . it won ' t sound too pretty to say
you ' ve caught the kitten and let the cat escape . '
the voices began to move away . sam heard the sound of feet receding . he
was recovering from his shock [???] and now a wild fury was on him . ` i got it all
wrong ! ' he cried . ` i knew i would . now they ' ve got him [???] the devils ! the
filth ! never leave your master [???] never [???] never : that was my right rule . and i
knew it in my heart . may i be forgiven ! now i ' ve got to get back to him .
somehow [???] somehow ! '
he drew his sword again and beat on the stone with the hilt [???] but it
only gave out a dull sound . the sword [???] however [???] bla zed so brightly now that
he could see dimly in its light . to his surprise he noticed that the great
block was shaped like a heavy door [???] and was less than twice his own height .
above it was a dark blank space between the top and the low arch of the
opening . it was probably only meant to be a stop against the [???] of
[???] [???] fastened on the inside with some latch or bolt beyond the reach of
her cunning . with his remaining strength sam leaped and caught the top [???]
[???] up [???] and dropped ; and then he ran madly [???] sword blazing in hand [???]
round a bend and up a winding tunnel .
the news that his master was still alive roused him to a last effort
beyond thought of weariness . he could not see anything ahead . for this new
passage twisted and turned constantly ; but he thought he was catching the

two [???] up : their voices were growing nearer again . now they seemed quite
close .
` that ' s what i ' m going to do [???] ' said [???] in angry tones . ' put him
right up in the top chamber . '
` what for ? ' growled [???] . ` haven ' t you any lock - ups down below ? '
` he ' s going out of harm ' s way [???] i tell you [???] ' answered [???] . ' see ?
he ' s precious . i don ' t trust all my lads [???] and none of yours ; nor you
neither [???] when you ' re mad for fun . he ' s going where i want him [???] and where you
won ' t come [???] if you don ' t keep civil . up to the top [???] i say . he ' ll be safe
there . '
` will he ? ' said sam . ' you ' re forgetting the great big elvish warrior
that ' s loose ! ' and with that he raced round the last corner [???] only to find
that by some trick of the tunnel [???] or of the hearing which the ring gave him [???]
he had [???] the distance .
the two orc - figures were still some way ahead . he could see them now [???]
black and squat against a red glare . the passage ran straight at last [???] up an
incline ; and at the end [???] wide open [???] were great double doors [???] leading
probably to deep chambers far below the high horn of the tower . already the
[???] with their burden had passed inside . [???] and [???] were drawing
near the gate .
sam heard a burst of hoarse singing [???] blaring of horns and banging of
gongs [???] a hideous clamour . [???] and [???] were already on the [???] .
sam yelled and brandished sting [???] but his little voice was drowned in
the tumult . no one heeded him .
the great doors [???] to . boom . the bars of iron fell into place
inside . clang . the gate was shut . sam hurled himself against the bolted
brazen plates and fell senseless to the ground . he was out in the darkness .
[???] was alive but taken by the enemy .



here ends the second part of the history of the war of the ring .

the third part tells of the last defence against the shadow [???] and the
end of the mission of the ring - bearer in the return of the king .

chapter 1 . minas [???]



[???] looked out from the shelter of [???] ' s cloak . he wondered if
he was awake or still sleeping [???] still in the swift - moving dream in which he
had been wrapped so long since the great ride began . the dark world was
rushing by and the wind sang loudly in his ears . he could see nothing but
the wheeling stars [???] and away to his right vast shadows against the sky where
the mountains of the south marched past . sleepily he tried to reckon the
times and stages of their journey [???] but his memory was drowsy and uncertain .
there had been the first ride at terrible speed without a halt [???] and
then in the dawn he had seen a pale gleam of gold [???] and they had come to the
silent town and the great empty house on the hill . and hardly had they
reached its shelter when the winged shadow had passed over once again [???] and
men wilted with fear . but [???] had spoken soft words to him [???] and he had
slept in a corner [???] tired but uneasy [???] dimly aware of comings and goings and
of men talking and [???] giving orders . and then again riding [???] riding in
the night . this was the second [???] no [???] the third night since he had looked in
the stone . and with that hideous memory he woke fully [???] and shivered [???] and the
noise of the wind became filled with [???] voices .
a light kindled in the sky [???] a blaze of yellow fire behind dark [???]
[???] cowered back [???] afraid for a moment [???] wondering into what dreadful
country [???] was bearing him . he rubbed his eyes [???] and then he saw that it
was the moon rising above the eastern shadows [???] now almost at the full . so
the night was not yet old and for hours the dark journey would go on . he
stirred and spoke .
' where are we [???] [???] ? ' he asked .
' in the realm of [???] [???] ' the [???] answered . ' the land of [???] is
still passing by . '
there was a silence again for a while . then [???] ' what is that ? ' cried
[???] suddenly [???] clutching at [???] ' s cloak . ' look ! fire [???] red fire ! are
there dragons in this land ? look [???] there is another ! '
for answer [???] cried aloud to his horse . ' on [???] [???] ! we must

hasten . time is short . see ! the [???] of [???] are alight [???] calling for
aid . war is kindled . see [???] there is the fire on amon don [???] and flame on
[???] ; and there they go speeding west : [???] [???] [???] [???] min - [???] [???]
[???] [???] and the [???] on the borders of [???] . '
but [???] paused in his stride [???] slowing to a walk [???] and then he
lifted up his head and neighed . and out of the darkness the answering neigh
of other horses came ; and presently the [???] of [???] was heard [???] and
three riders swept up and passed like flying ghosts in the moon and vanished
into the west . then [???] gathered himself together and sprang away [???]
and
the night flowed over him like a roaring wind .
[???] became drowsy again and paid little attention to [???] telling
him of the customs of [???] [???] and how the lord of the city had [???] built
on the tops of [???] hills along both border s of the great range [???] and
maintained posts at these points where fresh horses were always in readiness
to bear his errand - riders to [???] in the north [???] or to [???] in the
south . ' it is long since the [???] of the north were lit [???] ' he said ; ' and
in the ancient days of [???] they were not needed [???] for they had the seven
stones . ' [???] stirred [???] .
' sleep again [???] and do not be afraid ! ' said [???] . ' for you are not
going like [???] to [???] [???] but to minas [???] [???] and there you will be as
safe as you can be anywhere in these days . if [???] falls [???] or the ring is
taken [???] then the shire will be no [???] . '
' you do not comfort me [???] ' said [???] [???] but nonetheless sleep crept over
him . the last thing that he remembered before he fell into deep dream was a
glimpse of high white peaks [???] [???] like floating isles above the clouds
as they caught the light of the westering moon . he wondered where [???] was [???]
and if he was already in [???] [???] or if he was dead ; and he did not know that
[???] from far away looked on that same moon as it set beyond [???] ere the
coming of the day .
[???] woke to the sound of voices . another day of hiding and a night
of journey had fleeted by . it was [???] : the cold dawn was at hand again [???]
and chill grey mists were about them . [???] stood steaming with sweat [???]
but he held his neck proudly and showed no sign of weariness . many tall men
heavily cloaked stood beside him [???] and behind them in the mist loomed a wall
of stone . partly ruinous it seemed [???] but already before the night was passed
the sound of hurried labour could be heard : beat of hammers [???] clink of

trowels [???] and the creak of wheels . torches and flares glowed dully here and
there in the fog . [???] was speaking to the men that barred his way [???] and
as he listened [???] became aware that he himself was being discussed .
' yea truly [???] we know you [???] [???] [???] ' said the leader of the men [???] ' and
you know the pass - words of the seven gates and are free to go forward . but
we do not know your companion . what is he ? a dwarf out of the mountains
in
the north ? we wish for no strangers in the land at this time [???] unless they be
mighty men of arms in whose faith and help we can trust . '
' i will vouch for him before the seat of [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' and
as for valour [???] that cannot be computed by stature . he has passed through
more battles and perils than you have [???] ingold [???] though you be twice his
height ; and he comes now from the storming of [???] [???] of which we bear
tidings [???] and great weariness is on him [???] or i would wake him . his name is
[???] [???] a very valiant man . '
' man ? ' said ingold [???] ; and the others laughed .
' man ! ' cried [???] [???] now thoroughly roused . ' man ! indeed not ! i am a
hobbit and no more valiant than i am a man [???] save perhaps now and again by
necessity . do not let [???] deceive you ! '
' many a doer of great deeds might say no more [???] ' said ingold . ' but what
is a hobbit ? '
' a halfling [???] ' answered [???] . ' nay [???] not the one that was spoken of [???] '
he added seeing the wonder in the men ' s faces . ' not he [???] yet one of his
kindred . '
' yes [???] and one who journeyed with him [???] ' said [???] . ' and [???] of
your city was with us [???] and he saved me in the snows of the north [???] and at the
last he was slain defending me from many foes . '
' peace ! ' said [???] . ' the news of that grief should have been told
first to the father . '
' it has been guessed already [???] ' said ingold ; ' for there have been
strange portents here of late . but pass on now quickly ! for the lord of
minas [???] will be eager to see any that bear the latest tidings of his
son [???] be he man or - - '
' hobbit [???] ' said [???] . ' little service can i offer to your lord [???] but
what i can do [???] i would do [???] remembering [???] the brave . '
' fare you well ! ' said ingold ; and the men made way for shadow fax [???] and
he passed through a narrow gate in the wall . ' may you bring good counsel to

[???] in his need [???] and to us all [???] [???] ! ' ingold cried . ' but you
come with tidings of grief and danger [???] as is your wont [???] they say . '
' because i come seldom but when my help is needed [???] ' answered [???] .
' and as for counsel [???] to you i would say that you are over - late in repairing
the wall of the [???] . courage will now be your best defence against the
storm that is at hand - that and such hope as i bring . for not all the
tidings that i bring are evil . but leave your trowels and sharpen your
swords ! '
' the work will be finished ere evening [???] ' said ingold . ' this is the last
portion of the wall to be put in defence : the least open to attack [???] for it
looks towards our friends of [???] . do you know aught of them ? will they
answer the summons [???] think you ? '
' yes [???] they will come . but they have fought many battles at your back .
this road and no road looks towards safety any longer . be [???] ! but for
[???] [???] you would have seen a host of foes coming out of
[???]
and no riders of [???] . and you may yet . fare you well [???] and sl eep not ! '
[???] passed now into the wide land beyond the rammas echor . so the
men of [???] called the out wall that they had built with great labour [???]
after [???] fell under the shadow of their enemy . for ten leagues or more
it ran from the mountains ' feet and so back again [???] enclosing in its fence
the fields of the [???] : fair and fertile [???] on the long [???]
and terraces falling to the deep levels of the [???] . at its furthest point
from the great gate of the city [???] north - eastward [???] the wall was four leagues
distant [???] and there from a frowning bank it overlooked the long flats beside
the river [???] and men had made it high and strong ; for at that point [???] upon a
walled causeway [???] the road came in from the fords and bridges of [???]
and passed through a guarded gate between [???] towers . at its nearest
point the wall was little more than one league from the city [???] and that was
south - eastward . there [???] [???] going in a wide knee about the hills of emyn
[???] in south [???] [???] bent sharply west [???] and the out - wall rose upon its
very brink ; and beneath it lay the quays and landings of the [???] for
craft that came [???] from the southern [???] .
the [???] were rich [???] with wide tilth and many orchards [???] and
[???] there were with oast and garner [???] fold and byre [???] and many [???]
[???] through the green from the [???] down to [???] . yet the

[???] and husbandmen that dwelt there were not many [???] and the most part
of
the people of [???] lived in the seven circles of the city [???] or in the high
vales of the mountain - borders [???] in [???] [???] or further south in fair
[???] with its five swift streams . there dwelt a hardy folk between the
mountains and the sea . they were reckoned men of [???] [???] yet their blood
was
mingled [???] and there were short and [???] folk among them whose sires came
more from the forgotten men who housed in the shadow of the hills in the
dark years ere the coming of the kings . but beyond [???] in the great fief of
[???] [???] dwelt prince [???] in his castle of dol amroth by the sea [???] and
he was of high blood [???] and his folk also [???] tall men and proud with sea - grey
eyes .
now after [???] had ridden for some time the light of day grew in the
sky [???] and [???] roused himself and looked up . to his left lay a sea of mist [???]
rising to a bleak shadow in the east ; but to his right great mountains
reared their heads [???] ranging from the west to a steep and sudden end [???] as if
in the making of the land the river had burst through a great barrier [???]
carving out a mighty valley to be a land of battle and debate in times to
come . and there where the white mountains of ered [???] came to their
end
he saw [???] as [???] had promised [???] the dark mass of mount [???] [???] the deep
purple shadows of its high glens [???] and its tall face whitening in the rising
day . and upon its out - thrust knee was the guarded city [???] with its seven walls
of stone so strong and old that it seemed to have been not builded but
carven by giants out of the bones of the earth .
even as [???] gazed in wonder the walls passed from looming grey to
white [???] blushing faintly in the dawn ; and suddenly the sun climbed over the
eastern shadow and sent forth a shaft that smote the face of the city . then
[???] cried aloud [???] for the tower of [???] [???] standing high within the
topmost walls ' shone out against the sky [???] [???] like a spike of pearl
and silver [???] tall and fair and shapely [???] and its [???] glittered as if it
were wrought of crystals ; and white banners broke and [???] from the
battlements in the morning breeze ' and high and far he heard a clear ringing
as of silver trumpets .
so [???] and [???] rode to the great gate of the men of [???] at
the rising of the sun [???] and its iron doors rolled back before them .

' [???] ! [???] ! ' men cried . ' now we know that the storm is
indeed nigh ! '
' it is upon you [???] ' said [???] . ' i have ridden on its wings . let me
pass ! i must come to your lord [???] [???] while his stewardship lasts .
whatever betide [???] you have come to the end of the [???] that you have
known .
let me pass ! '
then men fell back before the command of his voice and questioned him
no further [???] though they gazed in wonder at the hobbit that sat before him
and at the horse that bore him . for the people of the city used horses very
little and they were seldom seen in their streets [???] save only those ridden by
the errand - riders of their lord . and they said : ' surely that is one of the
great steeds of the king of [???] ? maybe the [???] will come soon to
strengthen us . ' but [???] walked proudly up the long winding road .
for the fashion of minas [???] was such that it was built on seven
levels [???] each delved into the hill [???] and about each was set a wall [???] and in
each wall was a gate . but the gates were not set in a line : the great gate
in the city wall was at the east point of the circuit [???] but the next faced
half south [???] and the third half north [???] and so to and fro upwards ; so that the
paved way that climbed towards the [???] turned first this way and then
that across the face of the hill . and each time that it passed the line of
the great gate it went through an arched tunnel [???] piercing a vast pier of
rock whose huge out - thrust bulk divided in two all the circles of the city
save the first . for partly in the primeval shaping of the hill [???] partly by
the mighty craft and labour of old [???] there stood up from the rear of the wide
court behind the gate a towering bastion of stone [???] its edge sharp as a
ship - keel facing east . up it rose [???] even to the level of the topmost circle [???]
and there was crowned by a battlement ; so that those in the [???] might [???]
like [???] in a mountainous ship [???] look from its peak sheer down upon the
gate seven hundred feet below . the entrance to the [???] also looked
eastward [???] but was delved in the heart of the rock ; thence a long lamp - lit
slope ran up to the seventh gate . thus men reached at last the high court [???]
and the place of the fountain before the feet of the white tower : tall and
shapely [???] fifty fathoms from its base to the [???] [???] where the banner of
the stewards floated a thousand feet above the plain .
a strong [???] it was indeed [???] and not to be taken by a host of
enemies [???] if there were any within that could hold weapons ; unless some foe

could come behind and scale the lower skirts of [???] [???] and so come upon
the narrow shoulder that joined the hill of guard to the mountain mass . but
that shoulder [???] which rose to the height of the fifth wall [???] was hedged with
great [???] right up to the [???] that [???] its western end ; and
in that space stood the houses and domed tombs of [???] kings and lords [???]
for ever silent between the mountain and the tower .
[???] gazed in growing wonder at the great stone city [???] vaster and more
[???] than anything that he had dreamed of ; greater and stronger than
[???] [???] and far more beautiful . yet it was in truth falling year by year
into decay ; and already it lacked half the men that could have dwelt at ease
there . in every street they passed some great house or court over whose
doors and arched gates were carved many fair letters of strange and ancient
shapes : names [???] guessed of great men and kindreds that had once dwelt
there ; and yet now they were silent [???] and no [???] rang on their wide
pavements [???] nor voice was heard in their halls [???] nor any face looked out from
door or empty window .
at last they came out of shadow to the seventh gate [???] and the warm sun
that shone down beyond the river [???] as [???] walked in the glades of [???] [???]
glowed here on the smooth walls and rooted pillars [???] and the great arch with
keystone carven in the likeness of a crowned and kingly head . [???]
[???] [???] for no horse was allowed in the [???] [???] and [???] suffered
himself to be led away at the soft word of his master .
the guards of the gate were robed in black [???] and their helms were of
strange shape [???] high - crowned [???] with long cheek - guards close - fitting to the
face [???] and above the cheek - guards were set the white wings of sea - birds ; but
the helms gleamed with a flame of silver [???] for they were indeed wrought of
[???] [???] [???] from the glory of old days . upon the black [???] were
[???] in white a tree blossoming like snow beneath a silver crown and
many - pointed stars . this was the livery of the heirs of [???] [???] and none
wore it now in all [???] [???] save the guards of the [???] before the court
of the fountain where the white tree once had grown .
already it seemed that word of their coming had gone before them : and
at once they were admitted [???] silently [???] and without question . quickly [???]
strode across the white - paved court . a sweet fountain played there in the
morning sun [???] and a sward of bright green lay about it ; but in the midst .
drooping over the pool [???] stood a dead tree [???] and the falling drops dripped
sadly from its barren and broken branches back into the clear water .

[???] glanced at it as he hurried after [???] . it looked mournful [???]
he thought [???] and he wondered why the dead tree was left in this place where
everything else was well tended .
seven stars and seven stones and one white tree .
the words that [???] had murmured came back into his mind . and then
he found himself at the doors of the great hall beneath the gleaming tower ;
and behind the [???] he passed the tall silent door - wardens and entered the
cool echoing shadows of the house of stone .
they walked down a paved passage [???] long and empty [???] and as they went
[???] spoke softly to [???] . ' be careful of your words [???] master [???] !
this is no time for hobbit pertness . [???] is a kindly old man . [???]
is of another sort [???] proud and subtle [???] a man of far greater lineage and
power [???] though he is not called a king . but he will speak most to you [???] and
question you much [???] since you can tell him of his son [???] . he loved him
greatly : too much perhaps ; and the more so because they were unlike . but
under cover of this love he will think it easier to learn what he witches
from you rather than from me . do not tell him more than you need [???] and leave
quiet the matter of [???] ' s errand . i will deal with that in due time . and
say nothing about [???] either [???] unless you must . '
' why not ? what is wrong with strider ? ' [???] whispered . ' he meant to
come here [???] didn ' t he ? and he ' ll be arriving soon himself anyway . '
' maybe [???] maybe [???] ' said [???] . ' though if he comes [???] it is likely to be
in some way that no one expects [???] not even [???] . it will be better so . at
least he should come [???] by us . '
[???] halted before a tall door of polished metal . ' see [???] master
[???] [???] there is no t ime to instruct you now in the history of [???] ;
though it might have been better [???] if you had learned something of it [???] when
you were still birds - nesting and playing truant in the woods of the shire .
do as i bid ! it is scarcely wise when bringing the news of the death of his
heir to a mighty lord to speak over much of the coming of one who will [???] if
he comes [???] claim the kingship . is that enough ? '
' kingship ? ' said [???] amazed .
' yes [???] ' said [???] . ' if you have walked all these days with closed
ears and mind asleep [???] wake up now ! ' he knocked on the door .
the door opened [???] but no one could be seen to open it . [???] looked
into a great hall . it was lit by deep windows in the wide [???] at either
side [???] beyond the rows of tall pillars that [???] the roof . [???] of

black marble [???] they rose to great capitals carved in many strange figures of
beasts and leaves ; and far above in shadow the wide vaulting gleamed with
dull gold [???] inset with flowing traceries of many colours . no hangings nor
storied webs [???] nor any things of woven stuff or of wood [???] were to be seen in
that long solemn hall ; but between the pillars there stood a silent company
of tall images graven in cold stone .
suddenly [???] was reminded of the hewn rocks of [???] [???] and awe
fell on him [???] as he looked down that avenue of kings long dead . at the far
end upon a dais of many steps was set a high throne under a canopy of marble
shaped like a crowned helm ; behind it was carved upon the wall and set with
gems an image of a tree in flower . but the throne was empty . at the foot of
the dais [???] upon the lowest step which was broad and deep [???] there was a stone
chair [???] black and [???] [???] and on it sat an old man gazing at his lap . in
his hand was a white rod with a golden [???] . he did not look up . solemnly
they paced the long floor towards him [???] until they stood three paces from his
[???] . then [???] spoke .
' hail [???] lord and steward of minas [???] [???] [???] son of [???] ! i
am come with counsel and tidings in this dark hour . '
then the old man looked up . [???] saw his carven face with its proud
bones and skin like ivory [???] and the long curved nose between the dark deep
eyes ; and he was reminded not so much of [???] as of [???] n . ' dark
indeed
is the hour [???] ' said the old man [???] ' and at such times you are wont to come [???]
[???] . but though all the signs [???] that the doom of [???] is
drawing nigh [???] less now to me is that darkness than my own darkness . it has
been told to me that you bring with you one who saw my son die . is this he ? '
' it is [???] ' said [???] . ' one of the twain . the other is with [???] of
[???] and may come hereafter . halflings they are [???] as you see [???] yet this is
not he of whom the [???] spoke . '
' yet a halfling still [???] ' said [???] grimly [???] ' and little love do i
bear the name [???] since those accursed words came to trouble our counsels and
drew away my son on the wild errand to his death . my [???] ! now we
have
need of you . [???] should have gone in his stead . '
' he would have gone [???] ' said [???] . ' be not unjust in your grief !
[???] claimed the errand and would not suffer any other to have it . he was
a masterful man [???] and one to take what he desired . i journeyed far with him

and learned much of his mood . but you speak of his death . you have had news
of that ere we came ? '
' i have received this [???] ' said [???] [???] and laying down his rod he
lifted from his lap the thing that he had been gazing at . in each hand he
held up one half of a great horn cloven through the middle : a wild - ox horn
bound with silver .
' that is the horn that [???] always wore ! ' cried [???] .
' verily [???] ' said [???] . ' and in my turn i bore it [???] and so did each
eldest son of our house [???] far back into the vanished years before the failing
of the kings [???] since [???] father of mardil hunted the wild kine of araw
in the far fields of rhyn . i heard it blowing dim upon the northern marches
thirteen days ago [???] and the river brought it to me [???] broken : it will wind no
more . ' he paused and there was a heavy silence . suddenly he turned his black
glance upon [???] . ' what say you to that [???] halfling ? '
' thirteen [???] thirteen days [???] ' faltered [???] . ' yes [???] i think that would be
so . yes [???] i stood beside him [???] as he blew the horn . but no help came . only
more [???] . '
' so [???] ' said [???] [???] looking keenly at [???] ' s face . ' you were there ?
tell me more ! why did no help come ? and how did you escape [???] and yet he
did
not [???] so mighty a man as he wa s [???] and only [???] to withstand him ? '
[???] [???] and forgot his fear . ' the mightiest man may be slain by
one arrow [???] ' he said ; ' and [???] was pierced by many . when last i saw him
he sank beside a tree and plucked a black - feathered shaft from his side .
then i swooned and was made captive . i saw him no more [???] and know no
more .
but i honour his memory [???] for he was very valiant . he died to save us [???] my
kinsman [???] and myself [???] [???] in the woods by the soldiery of the
dark lord ; and though he fell and failed [???] my gratitude is none the less . '
then [???] looked the old man in the eye [???] for pride stirred strangely
within him [???] still stung by the scorn and suspicion in that cold voice .
' little service [???] no doubt [???] will so great a lord of men think to find in a
hobbit [???] a halfling from the northern shire ; yet such as it is [???] i will offer
it [???] in payment of my debt . ' [???] aside his grey cloak [???] [???] drew
forth his small sword and laid it at [???] ' s feet .
a pale smile [???] like a gleam of cold sun on a winter ' s evening [???] passed
over the old man ' s face ; but he bent his head and held out his hand [???] laying

the shards of the horn aside . ' give me the weapon ! ' he said .
[???] lifted it and presented the hilt to him . ' whence came this ? '
said [???] . ' many [???] many years lie on it . surely this is a blade wrought
by our own kindred in the north in the deep past ? '
' it came out of the mounds that lie on the borders of my country ' said
[???] . ' but only evil [???] dwell there now [???] and i will not willingly tell
more of them . '
' i see that strange tales are woven about you [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and
once again it is shown that looks may belie the man - or the halfling . i
accept your service . for you are not [???] by words ; and you have
courteous speech [???] strange though the sound of it may be to us in the south .
and we shall have need of all folk of courtesy [???] be they great or small [???] in
the days to come . swear to me now ! '
' take the hilt [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and speak after the lord [???] if you are
resolved on this . '
' i am [???] ' said [???] .
the old man laid the sword along his lap [???] and [???] put his hand to
the hilt [???] and said slowly after [???] :
' here do i swear fealty and service to [???] [???] and to the lord and
steward of the realm [???] to speak and to be silent [???] to do and to let be [???] to
come and to go [???] in need or plenty [???] in peace or war [???] in living or dying [???] from
this hour henceforth [???] until my lord release me [???] or death take me [???] or the
world end . so say i [???] [???] son of [???] of the shire of the halflings . '
and this do i hear [???] [???] son of [???] [???] lord of [???] [???] steward
of the high king [???] and i will not forget it [???] nor fail to reward that which is
given : fealty with love [???] valour with honour [???] oath - breaking with vengeance . '
then [???] received back his sword and put it in its sheath .
' and now [???] ' said [???] [???] ' my first command to you : speak and be not
silent ! tell me your full tale [???] and see that you recall all that you can of
[???] [???] my son . sit now and begin ! ' as he spoke he struck a small silver
gong that stood near his [???] [???] and at once servants came forward .
[???] saw then that they had been standing in [???] on either side of the
door [???] unseen as he and [???] entered .
' bring wine and food and seats for the guests [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and see
that none trouble us for one hour . '
' it is all that i have to spare [???] for there is much else to heed [???] ' he
said to [???] . ' much of more import [???] it may seem [???] and yet to me less

pressing . but maybe we can speak again at the end of the day . '
' and earlier [???] it is to be hoped [???] ' said [???] . ' for i have not ridden
hither from [???] [???] one hundred and fifty leagues [???] with the speed of wind [???]
only to bring you one small warrior [???] however courteous . is it naught to you
that [???] has fought a great battle and that [???] is overthrown [???] and
that i have broken the staff of [???] ? '
' it is much to me . but i know already sufficient of these deeds for my
own counsel against the menace of the east . ' he turned his dark eyes on
[???] [???] and now [???] saw a likeness between the two [???] and he felt the
strain between them [???] almost as if he saw a line of [???] fire [???] drawn
from eye to eye [???] that might suddenly burst into flame .
[???] looked indeed much more like a great [???] than [???] did [???]
more kingly [???] beautiful [???] and powerful ; and older . yet by a sense other than
sight [???] perceived that [???] had the greater power and the deeper
wisdom [???] and a majesty that was veiled . and he was older [???] far older . ' how
much older ? ' he wondered [???] and then he thought how odd it was that he had
never thought about it before . [???] had said something about [???] [???]
but even then he had not thought of [???] as one of them . what was
[???] ? in what far time and place did he come into the world [???] and when
would he leave it ? and then his musings broke off [???] and he saw that [???]
and [???] still looked each other in the eye [???] as if reading the other ' s
mind . but it was [???] who first withdrew his gaze .
' yea [???] ' he said ; ' for though the stones be lost [???] they say [???] still the
lords of [???] have keener sight than lesser men [???] and many messages come
to
them . but sit now ! '
then men came bearing a chair and a low stool [???] and one brought a salver
with a silver flagon and cups [???] and white cakes . [???] sat down [???] but he
could not take his eyes from the old lord . was it so [???] or had he only
imagined it [???] that as he spoke of the stones a sudden gleam of his eye had
glanced upon [???] ' s face ?
' now tell me your tale [???] my liege [???] ' said [???] [???] half kindly ; half
mockingly . ' for the words of one whom my son so [???] will be
welcome
indeed . '
[???] never forgot that hour in the great hall under the piercing eye
of the lord of [???] [???] stabbed ever and anon by his shrewd questions [???] and

all the while conscious of [???] at his side [???] watching and listening [???] and
( so [???] felt ) holding in check a rising wrath and impatience . when the
hour was over and [???] again rang the gong [???] [???] felt worn out . ' it
cannot be more than nine o ' clock [???] ' he thought . ' i could now eat three
breakfasts on end . '
' lead the lord [???] to the [???] prepared for him [???] ' said
[???] [???] ' and his companion may lodge with him for the present [???] if he will .
but be it known that i have now sworn him to my service [???] and he shall be
known as [???] son of [???] and taught the lesser pass - words . send word
to the captains that they shall wait on me here [???] as soon as may be after the
third hour has rung .
' and you [???] my lord [???] [???] shall come too [???] as and when you will .
none shall hinder your coming to me at any time [???] save only in my brief hours
of sleep . let your wrath at an old man ' s folly run off and then return to my
comfort ! '
' folly ? ' said [???] . ' nay [???] my lord [???] when you are a dotard you will
die . you can use even your grief as a cloak . do you think that i do not
understand your purpose in questioning for an hour one who knows the least [???]
while i sit by ? '
' if you understand it [???] then be content [???] ' returned [???] . ' pride
would be folly that disdained help and counsel at need ; but you deal out
such gifts according to your own designs . yet the lord of [???] is not to
be made the tool of other men ' s purposes [???] however worthy . and to him there
is no purpose higher in the world as it now stands than the good of [???] ;
and the rule of [???] [???] my lord [???] is mine and no other man ' s [???] unless the king
should come again . '
' unless the king should come again ? ' said [???] . ' well [???] my lord
steward [???] it is your task to keep some kingdom still against that event [???]
which few now look to see . in that task you shall have all the aid that you
are pleased to ask for . but i will say this : the rule of no realm is mine [???]
neither of [???] nor any other [???] great or small . but all worthy things that
are in peril as the world now stands [???] those are my care . and for my part [???] i
shall not wholly fail of my task [???] though [???] should perish [???] if anything
passes through this night that can still grow fair or bear fruit and flower
again in days to come . for i also am a steward . did you not know ? ' and with
that he turned and strode from the hall with [???] running at his side .
[???] did not look at [???] or speak a word to him as they went .

their guide brought them from the doors of the hall [???] and then led them
across the court of the fountain into a lane between tall buildings of
stone . after several turns they came to a house close to the wall of the
[???] upon the north side [???] not far from the shoulder that linked the hill
with the mountain . within [???] upon the first floor above the street [???] up a wide
carven stair [???] he showed them to a fair room [???] light and airy [???] with goodly
hangings of dull gold sheen [???] . it was sparely furnished [???] having but
a small table [???] two chairs and a bench ; but at either side ther e were
curtained [???] and well - clad beds within with vessels and basins for
washing . there were three high narrow windows that looked northward over
the
great curve of [???] [???] still shrouded in mists [???] towards the emyn muil and
[???] far away . [???] had to climb on the bench to look out over the deep
stone sill .
' are you angry with me [???] [???] ? ' he said [???] as their guide went out and
closed the door . ' i did the best i could . '
' you did indeed ! ' said [???] [???] laughing suddenly ; and he came and
stood beside [???] [???] putting his arm about the hobbit ' s shoulders and gazing
out of the window . [???] glanced in some wonder at the face now close
beside his own [???] for the sound of that laugh had been gay and merry . yet in
the [???] ' s face he saw at first only lines of care and sorrow ; though as
he looked more intently he perceived that under all there was a great joy : a
fountain of mirth enough to set a kingdom laughing [???] were it to gush forth .
' indeed you did your best [???] ' said the [???] ; ' and i hope that it may be
long before you find yourself in such a tight corner again between two such
terrible old men . still the lord of [???] learned more from you than you
may have guessed [???] [???] . you could not hide the fact that bor [???] did not
lead the company from moria [???] and that there was one among you of high
honour
who was coming to minas [???] ; and that he had a famous sword . men think
much about the stories of old days in [???] ; and [???] has given long
thought to the rhyme and to the words [???] ' s bane [???] since [???] went
away .
' he is not as other men of this time [???] [???] [???] and whatever be his
descent from father to son [???] by some chance the blood of westernesse runs
nearly true in him ; as it does in his other son [???] [???] [???] and yet did not in
[???] whom he loved best . he has long sight . he can perceive [???] if he bends

his will thither [???] much of what is passing in the minds of men [???] even of those
that dwell far off . it is difficult to deceive him [???] and dangerous to try .
' remember that ! for you are now sworn to his service . i do not know
what put it into your head [???] or your heart [???] to do that . but it was well done .
i did not hinder it [???] for generous deed should not be checked by cold
counsel . it touched his heart [???] as well ( may i say it ) as pleasing his
humour . and at least you are free now to move about as you will in minas
[???] - when you are not on duty . for there is another side to it . you are
at his command ; and he will not forget . be wary still ! '
he fell silent and sighed . ' well [???] no need to brood on what tomorrow may
bring . for one thing [???] tomorrow will be certain to bring worse than today [???]
for many days to come . and there is nothing more that i can do to help it .
the board is set [???] and the pieces are moving . one piece that i greatly desire
to find is [???] [???] now the heir of [???] . i do not think that he is in
the city ; but i have had no time to gather news . i must go . [???] . i must
go to this lords ' council and learn what i can . but the enemy has the move [???]
and he is about to open his full game . and pawns are likely to see as much
of it as any [???] [???] son of [???] [???] soldier of [???] . sharpen your
blade ! '
[???] went to the door [???] and there he turned . ' i am in haste [???] [???] '
he said . ' do me a favour when you go out . even before you rest [???] if you are
not too weary . go and find [???] and see how he is housed . these
people
are kindly to beasts [???] for they are a good and wise folk [???] but they have less
skill with horses than some . '
with that [???] went out ; and as he did so [???] there came the note of a
clear sweet bell ringing in a tower of the [???] . three strokes it rang [???]
like silver in the air [???] and ceased : the third hour from the rising of the
sun .
after a minute [???] went to the door and down the stair and looked
about the street . the sun was now shining warm and bright [???] and the towers
and tall houses cast long clear - cut shadows westward . high in the blue air
mount [???] lifted its white helm and snowy cloak . armed men went to
and fro in the ways of the city [???] as if going at the striking of the hour to
changes of post and duty .
' nine o ' clock we ' d call it in the shire [???] ' said [???] aloud to himself .
' just the time for a nice breakfast by the open window in spring sunshine .

and how i should like breakfast ! do these people ever have it [???] or is it
over ? and when do they have dinner [???] and where ? '
presently he noticed a man [???] clad in black and white [???] coming along the
narrow street from the centre of the [???] towards him . [???] felt lonely
and made up his mind to speak as the man passed ; but he had no need . the man
came straight up to him .
' you are [???] the halfling ? ' he said . ' i am told that you have been
sworn to the service of the lord and of the city . welcome ! he held out his
hand and [???] took it .
' i am named [???] son of baranor . i have no duty this morning [???] and i
have been sent to you to teach you the pass - words [???] and to tell you some of
the many things that no doubt you will wish to know . and for my part [???] i
would learn of you also . for never before have we seen a halfling in this
land and though we have heard rumour of them [???] little is said of them in any
tale that we know . moreover you are a friend of [???] . do you know him
well ? '
' well [???] ' said [???] . ' i have known of him all my short life [???] as you
might say ; and lately i have travelled far with him . but there is much to
read in that book [???] and i cannot claim to have seen more than a page or two .
yet perhaps i know him as well as any but a few . [???] was the only one of
our company [???] i think [???] who really knew him . '
' [???] ? ' said [???] . ' who is he ? '
' oh [???] ' [???] [???] [???] ' he was a man who went about with us . i think
he is in [???] now . '
' you have been in [???] [???] i hear . there is much that i would ask you of
that land also ; for we put much of what little hope we have in its people .
but i am forgetting my errand [???] which was first to answer what you would ask .
what would you know [???] master [???] ? '
' er well [???] ' said [???] [???] ' if i may venture to say so [???] rather a burning
question in my mind at present is [???] well [???] what about breakfast and all that ?
i mean [???] what are the meal - times [???] if you understand me [???] and where is the
dining - room [???] if there is one ? and the inns ? i looked [???] but never a one could
i see as we rode up [???] though i had been borne up by the hope of a draught of
ale as soon as we came to the homes of wise and courtly men . '
[???] looked at him gravely . ' an old [???] [???] i see [???] ' he said .
' they say that men who go warring afield look ever to the next hope of food
and of drink ; though i am not a travelled man myself . then you have not yet

eaten today ? '
' well [???] yes [???] to speak in courtesy [???] yes [???] ' said [???] . ' but no more than
a cup of wine and a white cake or two by the kindness of your lord ; but he
racked me for it with an hour of questions [???] and that is hungry work . '
[???] laughed . ' at the table small men may do the greater deeds [???] we
say . but you have broken your fast as well as any man in the [???] [???] and
with greater honour . this is a fortress and a tower of guard and is now in
posture of war . we rise ere the sun [???] and take a morsel in the grey light [???]
and go to our duties at the opening hour . but do not despair ! ' he laughed
again [???] seeing the dismay in [???] ' s face . ' those who have had heavy duty
take somewhat to refresh their strength in the mid - morning . then there is
the [???] [???] at noon or after as duties allow ; and men gather for the
[???] [???] and such mirth as there still may be [???] about the hour of sunset .
' come ! we will walk a little and then go find us some refreshment [???] and
eat and drink on the battlement [???] and survey the fair morning . '
' one moment ! ' said [???] blushing . ' greed [???] or hunger by your courtesy [???]
put it out of my mind . but [???] [???] [???] as you call him [???] asked me to
see to his horse - [???] [???] a great steed of [???] [???] and the apple of the
king ' s eye [???] i am told [???] though he has given him to [???] for his
services . i think his new master loves the beast better than he loves many
men [???] and if his good will is of any value to this city [???] you will treat
[???] with all honour : with greater kindness than you have treated this
hobbit [???] if it is possible . '
' hobbit ? ' said [???] .
' that is what we call ourselves [???] ' said [???] .
' i am glad to learn it [???] ' said [???] [???] ' for now i may say that strange
accents do not mar fair speech [???] and [???] are a fair - spoken folk . but
come ! you shall make me acquainted with this good horse . i love beasts [???] and
we see them seldom in this stony city ; for my people came from the
mountain - vales [???] and before that from [???] . but fear not ! the visit shall
be short [???] a mere call of courtesy [???] and we will go thence to the butteries . '
[???] found that [???] had been well housed and tended . for in the
sixth circle [???] outside the walls of the [???] [???] there were some fair stables
where a few swift horses were kept [???] hard by the lodgings of the
errand - riders of the lord : messengers always ready to go at the urgent
command of [???] or his chief captains . but now all the horses and the
riders were out and away .

[???] [???] as [???] entered the stable and turned his head .
' good morning ! ' said [???] . ' [???] will come as soon as he may . he is
busy [???] but he sends greetings [???] and i am to see that all is well with you ; and
you resting [???] i hope [???] after your long labours . '
[???] tossed his head and stamped . but he allowed [???] to
handle his head gently and stroke his great flanks .
' he looks as if he were spoiling for a race [???] and not newly come from a
great journey [???] ' said [???] . ' how strong and proud he is ! where is his
harness ? it should be rich and fair . '
' none is rich and fair enough for him [???] ' said [???] . ' he will have
none . if he will consent to bear you [???] bear you he does ; and if not [???] well [???] no
bit [???] bridle [???] whip [???] or thong will tame him . farewell [???] [???] ! have
patience . battle is coming . '
[???] lifted up his head and neighed [???] so that the stable shook [???] and
they covered their ears . then they took their leave [???] seeing that the manger
was well filled .
' and now for our manger [???] ' said [???] [???] and he led [???] back to the
[???] [???] and so to a door in the north side of the great tower . there they
went down a long cool stair into a wide alley lit with lamps . there were
hatches in the walls at the side [???] and one of these was open .
' this is the storehouse and buttery of my company of the guard . ' said
[???] . ' greetings [???] [???] ! ' he called through the hatch . ' it is early
yet [???] but here is a [???] that the lord has taken into his service . he has
ridden long and far with a tight belt [???] and has had sore labour this morning [???]
and he is hungry . give us what you have ! '
they got there bread [???] and butter [???] and cheese and apples : the last of
the winter store [???] wrinkled but sound and sweet ; and a leather flagon of
new - drawn ale [???] and wooden platters and cups . they put all into a [???]
basket and climbed back into the sun ; and [???] brought [???] to a place
at the east end of the great out - thrust battlement where there was an
[???] in the walls with a stone seat beneath the sill . from there they
could look out on the morning over the world .
they ate and drank ; and they talked now of [???] and its ways and
customs [???] now of the shire and the strange countries that [???] had seen .
and ever as they talked [???] was more amazed [???] and looked with greater
wonder at the hobbit [???] swinging his short legs as he sat on the seat [???] or
standing [???] upon it to peer over the sill at the lands below .

' i will not hide from you [???] master [???] [???] ' said [???] [???] ' that to us
you look almost as one of our children [???] a lad of nine summers or so ; and yet
you have endured perils and seen marvels that few of our [???] could
boast of . i thought it was the whim of our lord to take him a noble page [???]
after the manner of the kings of old [???] they say . but i see that it is not so [???]
and you must pardon my foolishness . '
' i do [???] ' said [???] . ' though you are not far wrong . i am still little
more than a boy in the reckoning of my own people [???] and it will be four years
yet before i [???] come of age [???] [???] as we say in the shire : but do not bother about
me . come and look and tell me what i can see . '
the sun was now climbing [???] and the mists in the vale below had been
drawn up . the last of them were floating away [???] just overhead [???] as wisps of
white cloud borne on the stiffening breeze from the east [???] that was now
flapping and tugging the flags and white standards of the [???] . away down
in the valley - bottom [???] five leagues or so as the eye leaps [???] the great river
could now be seen grey and glittering [???] coming out of the north - west [???] and
bending in a mighty sweep south and west again [???] till it was lost to view in
a haze and [???] [???] far beyond which lay the sea fifty leagues away .
[???] could see all the [???] laid out before him [???] dotted into the
distance with [???] and little walls [???] barns and byres [???] but nowhere
could he see any kine or other beasts . many roads and tracks crossed the
green fields [???] and there was much coming and going : wains moving in lines
towards the great gate [???] and others passing out . now and again a horseman
would ride up [???] and leap from the saddle and hasten into the city . but most
of the traffic went out along the chief highway [???] and that turned south [???] and
then bending swifter than the river [???] the hills and passed soon from
sight . it was wide and well - paved [???] and along its eastern edge ran a broad
green riding - track [???] and beyond that a wall . on the ride horsemen [???] to
and fro [???] but all the street seemed to be choked with great covered wains
going south . but soon [???] saw that all was in fact well - ordered : the
wains were moving in three lines [???] one swifter drawn by horses ; another
slower [???] great waggons with fair [???] of many colours [???] drawn by oxen ; and
along the west rim of the road many smaller carts hauled by [???] men .
' that is the road to the vales of [???] and [???] [???] and the
mountain - villages [???] and then on to [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' there go the
last of the wains that bear away to [???] the aged the children [???] and the
women that must go with them . they must all be gone from the gate and the

road clear for a league before noon : tha t was the order . it is a sad
necessity . ' he sighed . ' few [???] maybe [???] of those now sundered will meet again .
and there were always too few children in this city ; but now there are
none - save some young lads that will not depart [???] and may find some task to
do : my own son is one of them . '
they fell silent for a while . [???] gazed anxiously eastward [???] as if at
any moment he might see thousands of [???] pouring over the fields . ' what can
i see there ? ' he asked [???] pointing down to the middle of the great curve of
the [???] . ' is that another city [???] or what is it ? '
' it was a city [???] ' said [???] [???] ' the chief city of [???] [???] of which
this was only a fortress . for that is the ruin of [???] on either side
of [???] [???] which our enemies took and burned long ago . yet we won it back in
the days of the youth of [???] : not to dwell in [???] but to hold as an
[???] [???] and to rebuild the bridge for the passage of our arms . and then
came the fell riders out of minas [???] . '
' the black r iders ? ' said [???] [???] opening his eyes [???] and they were wide
and dark with an old fear re - awakened .
' yes [???] they were black [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and i see that you know
something of them [???] though you have not spoken of them in any of your tales . '
' i know of them [???] ' said [???] softly [???] ' but i will not speak of them
now [???] so near [???] so near . ' he broke off and lifted his eyes above the river [???]
and it seemed to him that all he could see was a vast and threatening
shadow . perhaps it was mountains looming on the verge of sight [???] their jagged
edges softened by [???] twenty leagues of misty air ; perhaps it was but a
cloud - wall [???] and beyond that again a yet deeper gloom . but even as he looked
it seemed to his eyes that the gloom was growing and gathering [???] very slowly [???]
slowly rising to smother the regions of the sun .
' so near to [???] ? ' said [???] quietly . ' yes [???] there it lies . we
seldom name it ; but we have dwelt ever in sight of that shadow : sometimes it
seems fainter and more distant ; sometimes nearer and darker . it is growing
and darkening now ; and therefore our fear and [???] grow too . and the
fell riders [???] less than a year ago they won back the crossings [???] and many of
our best men were slain . [???] it was that drove the enemy at last back
from this western shore [???] and we hold still the near half of [???] . for a
little while . but we [???] now a new [???] there . maybe the chief
[???] of the war that comes . '
' when ? ' said [???] . ' have you a guess ? for i saw the [???] last

night and the errand - riders ; and [???] said that it was a sign that war
had begun . he seemed in a desperate hurry . but now everything seems to have
slowed up again . '
' only because everything is now ready [???] ' said [???] . ' it is but the
deep breath before the [???] . '
' but why were the [???] lit last night ? '
' it is over - late to send for aid when you are already [???] [???] '
answered [???] . ' but i do not know the counsel of the lord and his
captains . they have many ways of gathering news . and the lord [???] is
unlike other men : he sees far . some say that as he sits alone in his high
chamber in the tower at night [???] and bends his thought this way and that [???] he
can read somewhat of the future ; and that he will at times search even the
mind of the enemy [???] wrestling with him . and so it is that he is old [???] worn
before his time . but however that may be [???] my lord [???] is abroad [???] beyond
the river on some perilous errand [???] and he may have sent tidings .
' but if you would know what i think set the [???] [???] [???] it was the
news that came [???] out of [???] . there is a great fleet drawing
near to the mouths of [???] [???] manned by the [???] of [???] in the south .
they have long ceased to fear the might of [???] [???] and they have allied them
with the enemy [???] and now make a heavy stroke in his cause . for this attack
will draw off much of the help that we looked to have from [???] and
[???] [???] where folk are hardy a nd [???] . all the more do our thoughts go
north to [???] ; and the more glad are we for these tidings of victory that
you bring .
' and yet ' - he paused and stood up [???] and looked round [???] north [???] east [???] and
south - ' the doings at [???] should warn us that we are caught now in a
great net and [???] . this is no longer a [???] at the fords [???] raiding
from [???] and from [???] [???] [???] and [???] . this is a great war
long - planned [???] and we are but one piece in it [???] whatever pride may say . things
move in the far east beyond the inland sea [???] it is reported ; and north in
[???] and beyond ; and south in harad . and now all realms shall be put to
the test [???] to stand [???] or fall - under the shadow .
' yet [???] master [???] [???] we have this honour : ever we bear the brunt of
the chief hatred of the dark lord [???] for that hatred comes down out of the
depths of time and over the deeps of the sea . here will the hammer - stroke
fall hardest . and for that reason [???] came hither in such haste . for
if we fall [???] who shall stand ? and [???] master [???] [???] do you see any hope that

we shall stand ? '
[???] did not answer . he looked at the great walls [???] and the towers and
brave banners [???] and the sun in the high sky [???] and then at the gathering gloom
in the east ; and he thought of the long fingers of that shadow : of the [???]
in the woods and the mountains [???] the treason of [???] [???] the birds of evil
eye [???] and the black riders even in the lanes of the shire - and of the winged
terror [???] the [???] . he [???] [???] and hope seemed to wither . and even at
that moment the sun for a second faltered and was obscured [???] as though a dark
wing had passed across it . almost beyond hearing he thought he caught [???] high
and far up in the heavens [???] a cry : faint [???] but heart - quelling [???] cruel and cold .
he blanched and cowered against the wall .
' what was that ? ' asked [???] . ' you also felt something ? '
' yes [???] ' muttered [???] . ' it is the sign of our fall [???] and the shadow of
doom [???] a fell rider of the air . '
' yes [???] the shadow of doom [???] ' said [???] . ' i fear that minas [???]
shall fall . night comes . the very warmth of my blood seems stolen away . '
for a time they sat together with bowed heads and did not speak . then
suddenly [???] looked up and saw that the sun was still shining and the
banners still streaming in the breeze . he shook himself . ' it is passed [???] ' he
said . ' no [???] my heart will not yet despair . [???] fell and has returned and
is with us . we may stand [???] if only on one leg [???] or at least be left still upon
our knees . '
' rightly said ! ' cried [???] [???] rising and striding to and fro . ' nay [???]
though all things must come utterly to an end in time [???] [???] shall not
perish yet . not though the walls be taken by a reckless foe that will build
a hill of carrion before them . there are still other [???] [???] and secret
ways of escape into the mountains . hope and memory shall live still in some
hidden valley where the grass is green . '
' all the same [???] i wish it was over for good or ill . ' said [???] . ' i am
no warrior at all and dislike any thought of battle ; but waiting on the edge
of one that i can ' t escape is worst of all . what a long day it seems
already ! i should be happier [???] if we were not obliged to stand and watch [???]
making no move [???] striking nowhere first . no stroke would have been struck in
[???] [???] i think [???] but for [???] . '
' ah [???] there you lay your finger on the sore that many feel ! ' said
[???] . ' but things may change when [???] returns . he is bold [???] more bold
than many deem ; for in these days men are slow to believe that a captain can

be wise and learned in the scrolls of lore and song [???] as he is [???] and yet a man
of [???] and swift judgement in the field . but such is [???] . less
reckless and eager than [???] [???] but not less resolute . yet what indeed can
he do ? we cannot assault the mountains of - of yonder realm . our reach is
shortened [???] and we cannot strike till some foe comes within it . then our hand
must be heavy ! ' he smote the hilt of his sword .
[???] looked at him : tall and proud and noble [???] as all the men that he
had yet seen in that land ; and with a glitter in his eye as he thought of
the battle . ' alas ! my own hand feels as light as a feather [???] ' he thought [???] but
he said nothing . ' a pawn did [???] say ? perhaps but on the wrong
chessboard . '
so they talked until the sun reached its height [???] and suddenly the
noon - bells were rung [???] and there was a stir in the [???] ; for all save the
watchmen were going to their meal .
' will you come with me ? ' said [???] . ' you may join my mess for this
day . i do not know to what company you will be assigned ; or the lord may
hold you at his own command . but you will be welcome . and it will be well to
meet as many men as you may [???] while there is yet time . '
' i shall be glad to come [???] ' said [???] . ' i am lonely [???] to tell you the
truth . i left my best friend behind in [???] [???] and i have had no one to talk
to or jest with . perhaps i could really join your company ? are you the
captain ? if so [???] you could take me on [???] or speak for me ? '
' nay [???] nay [???] ' [???] laughed [???] ' i am no captain . neither office nor rank
nor lordship have i [???] being but a plain man of arms of the third company of
the [???] . yet [???] master [???] [???] to be only a man of arms of the guard of
the tower of [???] is held worthy in the city [???] and such men have honour in
the land . '
' then it is far beyond me [???] ' said [???] . ' take me back to our room [???] and
if [???] is not there [???] i will go where you like - as your guest . '
[???] was not in the lodging and had sent no message ; so [???] went
with [???] and was made known to the men of the third company . and
it
seemed that [???] got as much honour from it as his guest [???] for [???] was
very welcome . there had already been much talk in the [???] about
[???] ' s companion and his long closeting with the lord ; and rumour
declared that a prince of the halflings had come out of the north to offer
allegiance to [???] and five thousand swords . and some said that when the

riders came from [???] each would bring behind him a halfling warrior [???] small
maybe [???] but [???] .
though [???] had [???] to destroy this hopeful tale [???] he could
not be rid of his new rank [???] only fitting [???] men thought [???] to one [???] by
[???] and honoured by the lord [???] ; and they thanked him for
coming
among them [???] and hung on his words and stories of the [???] [???] and gave him
as much food and ale as he could wish . indeed his only trouble was to be
' wary ' according to the counsel of [???] [???] and not to let his tongue wag
freely after the manner of a hobbit among friends .
at length [???] rose . ' farewell for this time ! ' he said . ' i have
duty now till sundown [???] as have all the others here [???] i think . but if you are
lonely [???] as you say [???] maybe you would like a merry guide about the city . my
son would go with you gladly . a good lad [???] i may say . if that pleases you [???] go
down to the lowest circle and ask for the old guesthouse in the rath
[???] [???] the [???] ' street . you will find him there with other lads
that are remaining in the city . there may be things worth seeing down at the
great gate ere the closing . '
he went out [???] and soon after all the others followed . the day was st ill
fine [???] though it was growing hazy [???] and it was hot for march [???] even so far
southwards . [???] felt sleepy [???] but the lodging seemed cheerless [???] and he
decided to go down and explore the city . he took a few [???] that he had
saved to [???] [???] and they were graciously accepted [???] though the horse
seemed to have no lack . then he walked on down many winding ways .
people stared much as he passed . to his face men were gravely
courteous [???] [???] him after the manner of [???] with bowed head and hands
upon the breast ; but behind him he heard many calls [???] as those out of doors
cried to others within to come and see the prince of the halflings [???] the
companion of [???] . many used some other tongue than the common
speech [???]
but it was not long before he learned at least what was meant by [???] i
[???] and knew that his title had gone down before him into the city .
he came at last by arched streets and many fair alleys and pavements to
the lowest and widest circle [???] a nd there he was directed to the [???] '
street [???] a broad way running towards the great gate . in it he found the old
guesthouse [???] a large building of grey weathered stone with two wings running

back from the street [???] and between them a narrow [???] [???] behind which
was
the many - windowed house [???] fronted along its whole width by a pillared porch
and a flight of steps down on to the grass . boys were playing among the
pillars [???] the only children that [???] had seen in minas [???] [???] and he
stopped to look at them . presently one of them caught sight of him [???] and with
a shout he sprang across the grass and came into the street [???] followed by
several others . there he stood in front of [???] [???] looking him up and down .
' greetings ! ' said the la d . ' where do you come from ? you are a stranger
in the city . '
' i was [???] ' said [???] ; ' but they say i have become a man of [???] . '
' oh come ! ' said the lad . ' then we are all men here . but how old are
you [???] and what is your name ? i am ten years a lready [???] and shall soon be five
feet . i am taller than you . but then my father is a guard [???] one of the
tallest . what is your father ? '
' which question shall i answer first ? ' said [???] . ' my father farms
the lands round whitwell near [???] in the shire . i am nearly
twenty - nine [???] so i pass you there ; though i am but four feet [???] and not likely
to grow any more [???] save sideways . '
' twenty - nine ! ' said the lad and whistled . ' why [???] you are quite old ! as
old as my uncle [???] . still [???] ' he added hopefully [???] ' i wager i could stand
you on your head or lay you on your back . '
' maybe you could [???] if i let you [???] ' said [???] with a laugh . ' and maybe i
could do the same to you : we know some wrestling tricks in my little
country . where [???] let me tell you [???] i am considered [???] large and
strong ; and i have never allowed anyone to stand me on my head . so if it
came to a trial and nothing else would serve [???] i might have to kill you . for
when you are older [???] you will learn that folk are not always what they seem ;
and though you may have taken me for a soft stranger - lad and easy prey [???] let
me warn you : i am not [???] i am a halfling [???] hard [???] bold [???] and wicked ! ' [???]
pulled such a grim face that the boy stepped back a pace [???] but at once he
returned with [???] fists and the light of battle in his eye .
' no ! ' [???] laughed . ' don ' t believe what strangers say of themselves
either ! i am not a fighter . but it would be politer in any case for the
challenger to say who he is . '
the boy drew himself up proudly . ' i am [???] son of [???] of the
guards [???] ' he said .

' so i thought [???] ' said [???] [???] ' for you look like your father . i know him
and he sent me to find you . '
' then why did you not say so at once ? ' said [???] [???] and suddenly a look
of dismay came over his face . ' do not tell me that he has changed his mind [???]
and will send me away with the maidens ! but no [???] the last wains have gone . '
' his message is less bad than that [???] if not good . ' said [???] . ' he says
that if you would prefer it to standing me on my head [???] you might show me
round the city for a while and cheer my loneliness . i can tell you some
tales of far countries in return . '
[???] clapped his hands [???] and laughed with relief . ' all is well [???] ' he
cried . ' come then ! we were soon going to the gate to look on . we will go
now . '
' what is happening there ? '
' the captains of the [???] are expected up the south road ere
sundown . come with us and you will see . '
[???] proved a good comrade [???] the best company [???] had had since he
parted from merry [???] and soon they were laughing and talking gaily as they
went about the streets [???] heedless of the many glances that men gave them .
before long they found themselves in a throng going towards the great gate .
there [???] went up much in the esteem of [???] [???] for when he spoke his
name and the pass - word the guard saluted him and let him pass through ; and
what was more [???] he allowed him to take his companion with him .
' that is good ! ' said [???] . ' we boys are no longer allowed to pass the
gate without an elder . now we shall see better . '
beyond the gate there was a crowd of men along the verge of the road
and of the great paved space into which all the wa ys to minas [???] ran .
all eyes were turned southwards [???] and soon a murmur rose : ' there is dust away
there ! they are coming ! '
[???] and [???] edged their way forward to the front of the crowd [???]
and waited . horns sounded at some distance [???] and the noise of cheering rolled
towards them like a gathering wind . then there was a loud trumpet - blast [???] and
all about them people were shouting .
' forlong ! forlong ! ' [???] heard men calling . ' what do they say ? ' he
asked .
' forlong has come [???] ' [???] answered ; ' old forlong the fat [???] the lord of
[???] . that is where my grandsire lives . hurrah ! here he is . good old
forlong ! '

leading the line there came walking a big thick - limbed horse [???] and on it
sat a man of wide shoulders and huge girth [???] but old and grey - bearded [???] yet
mail - clad and black - helmed and bearing a long heavy spear . behind him
marched proudly a dusty line of men [???] well - armed and bearing great
battle - axes ; grim - faced they were [???] and shorter and somewhat [???] than
any men that [???] had yet seen in [???] .
' forlong ! ' men shouted . ' true heart [???] true friend ! forlong ! ' but when
the men of [???] had passed they muttered : ' so few ! two hundreds [???]
what
are they ? we hoped for ten times the number . that will be the new tidings of
the black fleet . they are sparing only a tithe of their strength . still
every little is a gain . '
and so the companies came and were hailed and cheered and passed
through the gate [???] men of the [???] marching to defend the city of [???]
in a dark hour ; but always too few [???] always less than hope looked for or need
asked . the men of [???] vale behind the son of their lord [???] [???]
striding on foot : three hundreds . from the [???] of [???] [???] the great
[???] vale [???] tall [???] with his sons [???] [???] and [???] [???] and five
hundred bowmen . from the [???] [???] the [???] far away [???] a long line of
men of many sorts [???] hunters and [???] and men of little villages [???] scantily
equipped save for the hou sehold of [???] their lord . from [???] [???] a few
grim hillmen without a captain . fisher - folk of the [???] [???] some hundred or
more spared from the ships . [???] the fair of the green hills from [???]
gelin with three hundreds of gallant green - clad men . and last and proudest [???]
[???] [???] prince of dol amroth [???] kinsman of the lord [???] with gilded banners
bearing his token of the ship and the silver swan [???] and a company of knights
in full harness riding grey horses ; and behind them seven hundreds of men at
arms [???] tall as lords [???] grey - eyed [???] dark - haired [???] singing as they came .
and that was all [???] less than three thousands full told . no more would
come . their cries and the tramp of their feet passed into the city and died
away . the [???] stood silent for a while . dust hung in the air [???] for the
wind had died and the evening was heavy . already the closing hour was
drawing nigh [???] and the red sun had gone behind [???] . shadow came
down
on the city .
[???] looked up [???] and it seemed to him that the sky had grown
ashen - grey [???] as if a vast dust and smoke hung above them [???] and light came

dully through it . but in the west the dying sun had set all the fume on
fire [???] and now [???] stood black against a burning [???] flecked with
embers . ' so ends a fair day in wrath ! ' he said forgetful of the lad at his
side .
' so it will [???] if i have not returned before the sundown - bells [???] ' said
[???] . ' come ! there goes the trumpet for the closing of the gate . '
hand in hand they went back into the city [???] the last to pass the gate
before it was shut ; and as they reached the [???] ' street all the
bells in the towers tolled solemnly . lights sprang in many windows [???] and from
the houses and wards of the men at arms along the walls there came the sound
of song .
' farewell for this time [???] ' said [???] . ' take my greetings to my
: father [???] and thank him for the company that he sent . come again soon [???] i beg .
almost i wish now that there was no war [???] for we might have had some merry
times . we might have journeyed to [???] [???] to my grandsire ' s house ; it is
good to be there in spring [???] the woods and fields are full of flowers . but
maybe we will go thither together yet . they will never overcome our lord [???]
and my father is very valiant . farewell and return ! '
they parted and [???] hurried back towards the [???] . it seemed a
long way [???] and he grew hot and very hungry ; and night closed down swift and
dark . not a star pricked the sky . he was late for the [???] in the mess [???]
and [???] greeted him gladly [???] and sat him at his side to hear news of his
son . after the meal [???] stayed a while [???] and then took his leave [???] for a
strange gloom was on him [???] and now he desired very much to see [???]
again .
' can you find your way ? ' said [???] at the door of the small hall [???]
on the north side of the [???] [???] where they had sat . ' it is a black night [???]
and all the blacker since orders came that lights are to be dimmed within
the city [???] and none are to shine out from the walls . and i can give you news
of another order : you will be summoned to the lord [???] early tomorrow .
i fear you will not be for the third company . still we may hope to meet
again . farewell and sleep in peace ! '
the lodging was dark [???] save for a little lantern set on the table .
[???] was not there . gloom settled still more heavily on [???] . he
climbed on the bench and tried to peer out of a window [???] but it was like
looking into a pool of ink . he got down and closed the shutter and went to
bed . for a while he lay and listened for sounds of [???] ' s return [???] and

then he fell into an uneasy sleep .
in the night he was wakened by a light [???] and he saw that [???] had
come and was pacing to and fro in the room beyond the curtain of the [???] .
there were candles on the table and rolls of [???] . he heard the [???]
sigh [???] and mutter : ' when will [???] return ? '
' hullo ! ' said [???] [???] poking his head round the curtain . ' i thought you
had forgotten all about me . i am glad to see you back . it has been a long
day . '
' but the night will be too short [???] ' said [???] . ' i have come back
here [???] for i must have a little peace [???] alone . you should sleep [???] in a bed
while you still may . at the [???] i shall take you to the lord [???]
again . no [???] when the summons comes [???] not at [???] . the darkness has begun .
there will be no dawn . '




chapter 2 . the passing of the grey company



[???] was gone [???] and the [???] [???] of [???] were lost in the
night [???] when merry came back to [???] . he had only a light bundle [???] for he
had lost his pack at parth [???] [???] and all he had was a few useful things he
had picked up among the wreckage of [???] . [???] was already saddled .
legolas and [???] with their horse stood close by .
' so four of the company still remain [???] ' said [???] . ' we will ride on
together . but we shall not go alone [???] as i thought . the king is now
determined to set out at once . since the coming of the winged shadow [???] he
desires to return to the hills under cover of night . '
' and then whither ? ' said legolas .
' i cannot say yet [???] ' [???] answered . ' as for the king [???] he will go to
the muster that he commanded at [???] [???] four nights from now . and there [???] i
think [???] he will hear tidings of war [???] and the riders of [???] will go down to
minas [???] . but for myself [???] and any that will go with me . . . '
' i for one ! ' cried legolas . ' and [???] with him ! ' said the dwarf .
' well [???] for myself [???] ' said [???] [???] ' it is dark before me . i must go down
also to minas [???] [???] but i do not yet see the road . an hour long prepared
approaches . '
' don ' t leave me behind ! ' said merry . ' i have not been of much use yet ;
but i don ' t want to be laid aside [???] like [???] to be called for when all is
over . i don ' t think the riders will want to be bothered with me now . though [???]
of course [???] the king did say that i was to sit by him when he came to his
house and tell him all about the shire . '
' yes [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and your road lies with him [???] i think [???] merry . but
do not look for mirth at the ending . it will be long [???] i fear [???] ere [???]
sits at ease again in [???] . many hopes will wither in this bitter
spring . '
soon all were ready to depart : twenty - four horses [???] with [???] behind
legolas [???] and merry in front of [???] . presently they were riding swiftly
through the night . they had not long passed the mounds at the fords of isen [???]
when a rider [???] up from the rear of their line .
' my lord [???] ' he said to the king [???] ' there are horsemen behind us . as we
crossed the fords i thought that i heard them . now we are sure . they are

overtaking us [???] riding hard . '
[???] at once called a halt . the riders turned about and seized their
spears . [???] [???] and set merry on the ground [???] and drawing his
sword he stood by the king ' s stirrup . jomer and his esquire rode back to the
rear . merry felt more like [???] [???] than ever [???] and he wondered [???] if
there was a fight [???] what he should do . supposing the king ' s small escort was
trapped and overcome [???] but he escaped into the darkness - alone in the wild
fields of [???] with no idea of where he was in all the endless miles ? ' no
good ! ' he thought . he drew his sword and tightened his belt .
the sinking moon was obscured by a great sailing cloud [???] but suddenly it
rode out clear again . then they all heard the sound of [???] [???] and at the
same moment they saw dark shapes coming swiftly on the path from the fords .
the moonlight glinted here and there on the points of spears . the number of
the pursuers could not be told [???] but they seemed no fewer than the king ' s
escort [???] at the least .
when they were some fifty paces off [???] jomer cried in a loud voice :
' halt ! halt ! who rides in [???] ? '
the pursuers brought their steeds to a sudden stand . a silence
followed : and then in the moonlight [???] a horseman could be seen [???]
and walking slowly forward . his hand showed white as he held it up [???] palm
outward [???] in token of pea ce ; but the king ' s men gripped their weapons . at ten
paces the man stopped . he was tall [???] a dark standing shadow . then his clear
voice rang out .
' [???] ? [???] did you say ? that is a glad word . we seek that land in
haste from long afar . '
' you have found it [???] ' said jomer . ' when you crossed the fords yonder you
entered it . but it is the realm of [???] the king . none ride here save by
his leave . who are you ? and what is your haste ? '
' [???] d [???] [???] [???] ranger of the north i am [???] ' cried the man . ' we seek
one [???] son of [???] [???] and we heard that he was in [???] . '
' and you have found him also ! ' cried [???] . giving his reins to
merry [???] he ran forward and embraced the [???] . ' [???] ! ' he said . ' of
all joys this is the least expected ! '
merry breathed a sigh of relief . he had thought that this was some last
trick of [???] ' s [???] to waylay the king while he had only a few men about
him ; but it seemed that there would be no need to die in [???] ' s defence [???]
not yet at any rate . he sheathed his sword .

' all is well [???] ' said [???] [???] turning back . ' here are some of my own kin
from the far land where i dwelt . but why they come [???] and how many they be [???]
[???] shall tell us . '
' i have thirty with me [???] ' said [???] . ' that is all of our kindred
that could be gathered in haste ; but the brethren [???] and [???] have
ridden with us [???] desiring to go to the war . we rode as swiftly as we might
when your summons came . '
' but i did not summon you [???] ' said [???] [???] ' save only in wish . my
thoughts have often turned to you [???] and seldom more than tonight ; yet i have
sent no word . but come ! all such matters must wait . you find us riding in
haste and danger . ride with us now [???] if the king will give his leave . '
[???] was indeed glad of the news . ' it is well ! ' he said . ' if these
kinsmen be in any way like to yourself [???] my lord [???] [???] thirty such knights
will be a strength that cannot be counted by heads . '
then the riders set out again [???] and [???] n for a while rode with the
d [???] nedain ; and when they had spoken of tidings in the north and in the south [???]
[???] said to him :
' i bring word to you from my father : the days are short . if thou art in
haste [???] remember the paths of the dead . '
' always my days have seemed to me too short to achieve my desire [???] '
answered [???] . ' but great indeed will be my haste ere i take that road . '
' that will soon be seen [???] ' said [???] . ' but let us speak no more of
these things upon the open road ! '
and [???] said to [???] : ' what is that that you bear [???] kinsman ? '
for he saw that instead of a spear he bore a tall staff [???] as it were a
standard [???] but it was close - furled in a black cloth bound about with many
[???] .
' it is a gift that i bring you from the lady of [???] [???] ' answered
[???] . ' she wrought it in secret [???] and long was the making . but she also
sends word to you : the days now are short . either our hope cometh [???] or all
hopes end . therefore i send thee what i have made for thee . fare well [???]
[???] ! '
and [???] said : ' now i know what you bear . bear it still for me a
while ! ' and he turned and looked away to the north under the great stars [???]
and then he fell silent and spoke no more while the night ' s journey lasted .
the night was old and the east grey when they rode up at last from
deeping - coomb and came back to the [???] . there they were to lie and rest

for a brief while and take counsel .
merry slept until he was roused by legolas and [???] . ' the sun is
high [???] ' said legolas . ' all others are up and doing . come [???] master [???] [???]
and look at this place while you may ! '
' there was a battle here three nights ago [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and here
legolas and i played a game that i won only by a single orc . come and see
how it was ! and there are caves [???] merry [???] caves of wonder ! shall we visit
them [???] legolas [???] do you think ? '
' nay ! there is no time [???] ' said the elf . ' do not spoil the wonder with
haste ! i have given you my wor d to return hither with you [???] if a day of peace
and freedom comes again . but it is now near to noon [???] and at that hour we
eat [???] and then set out again [???] i hear . '
merry got up and yawned . his few hours ' sleep had not been nearly
enough ; he was t ired and rather dismal . he missed [???] [???] and felt that he
was only a burden [???] while everybody was making plans for speed in a business
that he did not fully understand . ' where is [???] ? ' he asked .
' in a high chamber of the burg [???] ' said legolas . ' he has neither rested
nor slept [???] i think . he went thither some hours ago [???] saying that he must take
thought [???] and only his kinsman [???] [???] [???] went with him ; but some dark doubt
or care sits on him . '
' they are a strange company [???] these [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' stout men
and lordly they are [???] and the riders of [???] look almost as boys beside
them ; for they are grim men of face [???] worn like weathered rocks for the most
part [???] even as [???] himself ; and they are silent . '
' but even as [???] they are courteous [???] if they break their silence . '
said legolas . ' and have you marked the brethren [???] and [???] ? less
[???] is their gear than the others ' [???] and they are fair and gallant as
elven - lords ; and that is not to be wondered at in the sons of [???] of
[???] . '
' why have they come ? have you heard ? ' asked merry . he had now dressed [???]
and he flung his grey cloak about his shoulders ; and the three passed out
together towards the ruined gate of the burg .
' they answered a summons [???] as you heard [???] ' said [???] . ' word came to
[???] [???] they say : [???] has need of his kindred . let the d [???] nedain ride
to him in [???] ! but whence this message came they are now in doubt .
[???]
sent it [???] i would guess . '

' nay [???] [???] [???] ' said legolas . ' did she not speak through [???] of
the ride of the grey company from the north ? '
' yes [???] you have it [???] ' said [???] . ' the lady of the wood ! she read many
hearts and desires . now why did not we wish for some of our own kinsfolk [???]
legolas ? '
legolas stood before the gate and turned his bright eyes away north and
east [???] and his fair face was troubled . ' i do not think that any would come [???] '
he answered . ' they have no need to ride to war ; war already marches on their
own lands . '
for a while the three companions walked together [???] speaking of this and
that turn of the battle [???] and they went down from the broken gate [???] and passed
the mounds of the fallen on the [???] beside the road [???] until they stood
on helm ' s dike and looked into the coomb . the death down already stood
there [???] black and tall and stony [???] and the great trampling and [???] of the
grass by the [???] could be plainly seen . the [???] and many men of
the [???] of the burg were at work on the dike or in the fields and about
the battered walls behind ; yet all seemed strangely quiet : a weary valley
resting after a great storm . soon they turned back and went to the midday
meal in the hall of the burg .
the king was already there [???] and as soon as they entered he called for
merry and had a seat set for him at his side . ' it is not as i would have
it [???] ' said [???] ; ' for this is little like my fair house in [???] . and
your friend is gone [???] who should also be here . but it may be long ere we si t [???]
you and i [???] at the high table in [???] ; there will be no time for feasting
when i return thither . but come now ! eat and drink [???] and let us speak
together while we may . and then you shall ride with me . '
' may i ? ' said merry [???] surprised and delighted . ' that would be [???] ! '
he had never felt more grateful for any kindness in words . ' i am afraid i am
only in everybody ' s way [???] ' he [???] ; ' but i should like to do anything i
could [???] you know . '
' i doubt it not [???] ' said the king . ' i have had a good hill - pony made
ready for you . he will bear you as swift as any horse by the roads that we
shall take . for i will ride from the burg by mountain paths [???] not by the
plain [???] and so come to [???] by way of [???] where the lady [???]
[???]
me . you shall be my esquire [???] if you will . is there gear of war in this
place [???] jomer [???] that my sword - thain could use ? '

' there are no great weapon - hoards here [???] lord . ' answered jomer . ' maybe a
light helm might be found to fit him ; but we have no mail or sword for one
of his stature . '
' i have a sword [???] ' said merry [???] climbing from his seat [???] and drawing from
its black sheath his small bright blade . filled suddenly with love for this
old man [???] he knelt on one knee [???] and took his hand and kissed it . ' may i lay
the sword of [???] of the shire on your lap [???] king ? ' he cried .
' receive my service [???] if you will ! '
' gladly will i take it [???] ' said the king ; and laying his long old hands
upon the brown hair of the hobbit ; he blessed him . ' rise now [???] [???] [???]
esquire of [???] of the household of [???] ! ' he said . ' take your sword
and bear it unto good fortune ! '
' as a father you shall be to me [???] ' said merry .
' for a little while [???] ' said [???] .
they talked then together as they ate [???] until presently jomer spoke . ' it
is near the hour that we set for our going [???] lord [???] ' he said . ' shall i bid men
sound the horns ? but where is [???] ? his place is empty and he has not
eaten . '
' we will make ready to ride [???] ' said [???] ; ' but let word be sent to
the lord [???] that the hour is nigh . '
the king with his guard and merry at his side passed down from the gate
of the burg to where the riders were assembling on the green . many were
already mounted . it would be a great company ; for the king was leaving only
a small [???] in the burg [???] and all who could be spared were riding to the
[???] at [???] . a thousand spears had indeed already ridden away at
night ; but still there would be some five hundred more to go with the king [???]
for the most part men from the fields and dales of westfold .
a little apart the rangers sat [???] silent [???] in an ordered company [???] armed
with spear and bow and sword . they were clad in cloaks of dark grey [???] and
their hoods were ca st now over helm and head . their horses were strong and
of proud bearing [???] but rough - haired ; and one stood there without a rider [???]
[???] ' s own horse that they had brought from the north ; [???] was his
name . there was no gleam of stone or gold [???] nor any fair thing in all their
gear and harness : nor did their riders bear any badge or token [???] save only
that each cloak was pinned upon the left shoulder by a brooch of silver
shaped like a rayed star .
the king mounted his horse [???] [???] [???] and merry sat beside him on his

pony : [???] was his name . presently jomer came out from the gate [???] and with
him was [???] [???] and [???] bearing the great staff close - furled in black [???]
and two tall men [???] neither young nor old so much alike were they [???] the sons of
[???] [???] that few could tell them apart : dark - haired [???] grey - eyed [???] and their
faces elven - fair [???] clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver - grey .
behind them walked legolas and [???] . but merry had eyes only for
[???] [???]
so startling wa s the change that he saw in him [???] as if in one night many
years had fallen on his head . grim was his face [???] grey - hued and weary .
' i am troubled in mind [???] lord [???] ' he said [???] standing by the king ' s horse .
' i have heard strange words [???] and i see new per ils far off . i have laboured
long in thought [???] and now i fear that i must change my purpose . tell me [???]
[???] [???] you ride now to [???] [???] how long will it be ere you come there ? '
' it is now a full hour past noon [???] ' said jomer . ' before the night of the
third day from now we should come to the hold . the moon will then be one
night past his full [???] and the muster that the king commanded will be held the
day after . more speed we cannot make [???] if the strength of [???] is to be
gathered . '
[???] was silent for a moment . ' three days [???] ' he murmured [???] ' and the
muster of [???] will only be begun . but i see that it cannot now be
hastened . ' he looked up [???] and it seemed that he had made some decision ; his
face was less troubled . then [???] by our leave [???] lord [???] i must take new counsel
for myself and my kindred . we must ride our own road [???] and no longer in
secret . for me the time of stealth has passed . i will ride east by the
swiftest way [???] and i will take the paths of the dead . '
' the paths of the dead ! ' said [???] [???] and trembled . ' why do you speak
of them ? ' jomer turned and gazed at [???] [???] and it seemed to merry that the
faces of the riders that sat within hearing turned pale at the words . ' if
there be in truth such paths [???] ' said [???] [???] ' their gate is in [???] ;
but no living man may pass it . '
' alas ! [???] my friend ! ' said jomer . ' i had hoped that we should ride
to war together ; but if you seek the paths of the dead [???] then our parting is
come [???] and it is little likely that we shall ever meet again under the sun . '
' that road i will take [???] nonetheless [???] ' said [???] . ' but i say to you [???]
jomer [???] that in battle we may yet meet again [???] though all the hosts of [???]
should stand between . '
' you will do as you wi ll [???] my lord [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' it is your

doom [???] maybe [???] to tread strange paths that others dare not . this parting
grieves me [???] and my strength is lessened by it ; but now i must take the
mountain - roads and delay no longer . farewell ! '
' farewell [???] lord ! ' said [???] . ' ride unto great renown ! farewell [???]
merry ! i leave you in good hands [???] better than we hoped when we hunted the
[???] to fangorn . legolas and [???] will still hunt with me [???] i hope ; but we
shall not forget you . '
' good - bye ! ' said merry . he could find no more to say . he felt very
small [???] and he was puzzled and depressed by all these gloomy words . more than
ever he missed the [???] cheerfulness of [???] . the riders were
ready [???] and their horses were [???] ; he wished they would start arid get
it over .
now [???] spoke to jomer [???] and he lifted up his hand and cried aloud [???]
and with that word the riders set forth . they rode over the dike and down
the coomb [???] and then [???] turning swiftly eastwards [???] they took a path that
[???] the [???] for a mile or so [???] until bending south it passed back
among the hills and disappeared from view . [???] rode to the dike and
watched till the king ' s men were far down the coomb . then he turned to
[???] .
' there go three that i love [???] and the smallest not the least [???] ' he said .
' he knows not to what end he rides ; yet if he knew [???] he still would go on . '
' a little people [???] but of great worth are the shire - folk [???] ' said
[???] . ' little do they know of our long labour for the [???] of
their borders [???] and yet i grudge it not . '
' and now our fates are woven together [???] ' said [???] . ' and yet [???] alas !
here we must part . well [???] i must eat a little [???] and then we also must hast en
away . come [???] legolas and [???] ! i must speak with you as i eat . '
together they went back into the burg ; yet for some time [???] sat
silent at the table in the hall [???] and the others waited for him to speak .
' come ! ' said legolas at last . ' speak and be comforted [???] and shake off the
shadow ! what has happened since we came back to this grim place in the grey
morning ? '
' a struggle somewhat grimmer for my part than the battle of the
[???] [???] ' answered [???] . ' i have looked in the stone of orthanc [???] my
friends . '
' you have looked in that accursed stone of [???] ! ' exclaimed [???]
with fear and astonishment in his face . ' did you say aught to - him ? even

[???] feared that encounter . '
' you forget to whom you speak [???] ' said [???] sternly [???] and his eyes
glinted . ' did i not openly proclaim my title before the doors of [???] ?
what do you fear that i should say to him ? nay [???] [???] [???] ' he said in a softer
voice [???] and the grimness left his face [???] and he looked like one who has
laboured in sleepless pain for many nights . ' nay [???] my friends [???] i and the
lawful master of the stone [???] and i had both the right and the strength to use
it [???] or so i judged . the right cannot be doubted . the strength was enough -
barely . '
he drew a deep breath . ' it was a bitter struggle [???] and the weariness is
slow to pass . i spoke no word to him [???] and in the end i wrenched the stone to
my own will . that alone he will find hard to endure . and he beheld me . yes [???]
master [???] [???] he saw me [???] but in other guise than you see me here . if that
will aid him [???] then i have done ill . but i do not think so . to know that i
lived and walked the earth was a blow to his heart [???] i deem ; for he knew it
not till now . the eyes in orthanc did not see through the armour of [???] ;
but [???] has not forgotten [???] and the sword of [???] . now in the
very hour of his great designs the heir of [???] and the sword are
revealed ; for l showed the blade re - forged to him . he is not so mighty yet
that he is above fear ; nay [???] doubt ever gnaws him . '
' but he [???] great dominion [???] nonetheless [???] ' said [???] ; ' and now he
will strike more swiftly . '
' the hasty stroke goes oft [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' we must press our
enemy [???] and no longer wait upon him for the move . see my friends [???] when i had
mastered the stone [???] i learned many things . a grave peril i saw coming
[???] - for upon [???] from the south that will draw off great strength
from the defence of minas [???] . if it is not countered swiftly [???] i deem
that the city will be lost ere ten days be gone . '
' then lost it must be [???] ' said [???] . ' for what help is there to send
thither [???] and how could it come there in time ? '
' i have no help to send [???] therefore i must go myself [???] ' said [???] .
' but there is only one way through the mountains that will bring me to the
[???] before all is lost . that is the paths of the dead . '
' the paths of the dead ! ' said [???] . ' it is a fell name ; and little to
the liking to the men of [???] [???] as i saw . can the living use such a road and
not perish ? and even if you pass that way [???] what will so few avail to counter
the strokes of [???] ? '

' the living have never used that road since the coming of the
[???] [???] ' said [???] [???] ' for it is closed to them . but in this dark hour
the heir of [???] may use it [???] if he dare . listen ! this is the word that
the sons of [???] bring to me from their father in [???] [???] wisest in
lore : bid [???] remember the words of the seer [???] and the paths of the
dead . '
' and what may be the words of the seer ? ' said legolas .
[???] thus spoke malbeth the seer [???] in the days of [???] [???] last king at
[???] [???] ' said [???] :
over the land there lies a long shadow [???]
westward reaching wings of darkness .
the tower trembles ; to the tombs of kings
doom approaches . the dead awaken ;
for the hour is come for the [???] ;
at the stone of erech they shall stand again
and hear there a horn in the hills ringing .
whose shall the horn be ? who shall call them
from the prey [???] [???] the forgotten people ?
the heir of him to whom the oath they swore .
from the north shall he come [???] need shall drive him :
he shall pass the door to the paths of the dead .
' dark ways doubtless [???] said [???] [???] but no darker than these staves are
to me . '
' if you would understand them better [???] then i bid you come with me [???] '
said [???] ; ' for that way i now shall take . but i do not go gladly ; only
need drives me . therefore [???] only of your free will would i have you come [???] for
you will find both toil and great fear [???] and maybe worse . '
' i will go with you even on the paths of the dead [???] and to whatever [???] end
they may lead [???] ' said [???] .
' i also will come [???] ' said legolas [???] ' for i do not fear the dead . '
' i hope that the forgotten people will not have forgotten how to
fight [???] ' said [???] ; ' for otherwise i see not why we should trouble them . '
' that we shall know if ever we come to erech [???] ' said [???] . ' but the
oath that they broke was to fight against [???] [???] and they must fight
therefore [???] if they are to fulfil it . for at erech there stands yet a black
stone that was brought [???] it was said [???] from n [???] menor by [???] ; and it was set
upon a hill [???] and upon it the king of the mountains swore allegiance to him

in the beginning of the realm of [???] . but when [???] returned and grew
in might again [???] [???] summoned the men of the mountains to fulfil their
oath [???] and they would not : for they had worshipped [???] in the dark years .
' then [???] said to their king : [???] thou shalt be the last king . and if
the west prove mightier than thy black master [???] this curse i lay upon thee
and thy folk : to rest never until your oath is fulfilled . for this war will
last through years [???] [???] and you shall be summoned once again ere the
end . [???] and they fled before the wrath of [???] [???] and did not dare to go
forth to war on [???] ' s part ; and they hid themselves in secret places in
the mountains and had no dealings with other men [???] but slowly [???] in the
barren hills . and the terror of the sleepless dead lies about the hill of
erech and all places where that people lingered . but that way i must go [???]
since there are none living to help me . '
he stood up . ' come ! ' he cried [???] and drew his sword [???] and it flashed in
the [???] hall of the burg . ' to the stone of erech ! i seek the paths of the
dead . come with me who will ! '
legolas and [???] made no answer [???] but they rose and followed [???]
from the hall . on the green there waited [???] still and silent [???] the hooded
rangers . legolas and [???] mounted . [???] sprang upon [???] .
then
[???] lifted a great horn [???] and the blast of it echoed in helm ' s deep ; and
with that they leapt away [???] riding down the coomb like thunder [???] while all the
men that were left on dike or burg stared in amaze .
and while [???] went by slow paths in the hills [???] the grey company
passed swiftly over the plain [???] and on the next day in the afternoon they
came to [???] ; and there they halted only briefly [???] ere they passed up the
valley [???] and so came to [???] as darkness fell .
the lady [???] greeted them and was glad of their coming ; for no
mightier men had she seen than the d [???] nedain and the fair sons of [???] ; but
on [???] most of all her eyes rested . and when they sat at supper with
her [???] they talked together [???] and she heard of all that had passed since
[???] rode away [???] concerning which only hasty tidings had yet reached her ;
and when she heard of the battle in helm ' s deep and the great slaughter of
their foes [???] and of the charge of [???] and his knights [???] then her eyes
shone .
but at last she said : ' lords [???] you are weary and shall now go to your
beds with such ease as can be contrived in haste . but tomorrow fairer

[???] shall be found for you . '
but [???] said : ' nay [???] lady [???] be not troubled for us ! if we may lie
here tonight and break our fast tomorrow [???] it will be enough . for i ride on
an errand most urgent [???] and with the first light of morning we must go . '
she smiled on him and said : ' then it was kindly done [???] lord [???] to ride so
many miles out of your way to bring tidings to [???] [???] and to speak with her
in her exile . '
' indeed no man would count such a journey wasted [???] ' said [???] ; ' and
yet [???] lady [???] i could not have come hither [???] if it were not that the road which
i must take leads me to [???] . '
and she answered as one that likes not what is said : [???] then [???] lord [???] you
are [???] ; for out of [???] no road runs east or south ; and you had
best return as you came . '
' nay [???] lady [???] ' said he [???] ' i am not [???] ; for i walked in this land ere
you were born to grace it . there is a road out of this valley [???] and that road
i shall take . tomorrow i shall ride by the paths of the dead . '
then she stared at him as one that is [???] [???] and her face blanched [???]
and for long she spoke no more [???] while all sat silent . ' but [???] [???] [???] ' she
said at last [???] ' is it then your errand to seek death ? for that is all that
you will find on that road . they do not suffer the living to pass . '
' they may suffer me to pass [???] ' said [???] ; ' but at the least i will
adventure it . no other road will serve . '
' but this is madness [???] ' she said . ' for here are men of renown and
[???] [???] whom you should not take into the shadows [???] but should lead to war [???]
where men are needed . i beg you to remain and ride with my brother ; for then
all our hearts will be [???] [???] and our hope be the brighter . '
' it is not madness [???] lady [???] ' he answered ; ' for i go on a path appointed .
but those who follow me do so of their free will ; and if they wish now to
remain and ride with the [???] [???] they may do so . but i shall take the
paths of the dead [???] alone [???] if needs be . '
then they said no more [???] and they ate in silence ; but her eyes were ever
upon [???] [???] and the others saw that she was in great torment of mind . at
length they arose [???] and took their leave of the lady [???] and thanked her for her
care [???] and went to their rest .
but as [???] came to the booth where he was to lodge with legolas and
[???] [???] and his companions had gone in . there came the lady [???] after him
and called to him . he turned and saw her as a glimmer in the night [???] for she

was clad in white ; but her eyes were on fire .
' [???] [???] ' she said [???] ' why will you go on this deadly road ? '
' because i must [???] ' he said . ' only so can i see any hope of doing my part
in the war against [???] . i do not choose paths of peril [???] [???] . were i to
go where my heart dwells [???] far in the north i would now be wandering in the
fair valley of [???] . '
for a while she was silent [???] as if pondering what this might mean . then
suddenly she laid her hand on his arm . ' you are a stern lord and resolute [???] '
she said ; ' and thus do men win renown . ' she paused . ' lord . ' she said [???] ' if
you must go [???] then let me ride in your following . for i am weary of [???]
in the hills [???] and wish to face peril and battle . '
' your duty is wi th your people [???] ' he answered .
' too often have i heard of duty [???] ' she cried . ' but am i not of the house
of [???] [???] a [???] and not a dry - nurse ? i have waited on faltering feet
long enough . since they falter no longer [???] it seems [???] may i not now spend my
life as i will ? '
' few may do that with honour [???] ' he answered . ' but as for you [???] lady : did
you not accept the charge to govern the people until their lord ' s return ? if
you had not been chosen [???] then some marshal or captain would have been set in
the same place [???] and he could not ride away from his charge [???] were he weary of
it or no . '
' shall i always be chosen ? ' she said bitterly . ' shall i always be left
behind when the riders depart [???] to mind the house while they win renown [???] and
find food and beds when they return ? '
' a time may come soon [???] ' said he [???] ' when none will return . then there
will be need of valour without renown [???] for none shall remember the deeds
that are done in the last defence of your homes . yet the deeds will not be
less valiant because they are [???] . '
and she answered : ' all your words are but to say : you are a woman [???] and
your part is in the house . but when the men have died in battle and honour [???]
you have leave to be burned in the house [???] for the men will need it no more .
but i am of the house of [???] and not a serving - woman . i can ride and wield
blade [???] and i do not fear either pain or death . '
' what do you fear [???] lady ? ' he asked .
' a cage [???] ' she said . ' to stay behind bars [???] until use and old age accept
them [???] and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire . '
' and yet you counselled me not to adventure on the road that i had

chosen [???] because it is perilous ? '
' so may one counsel another [???] ' she said . ' yet i do not bid you flee from
peril [???] but to ride to battle where your sword may win renown and victory . i
would not see a thing that is high and excellent cast away needlessly . '
' nor would i [???] ' he said . ' therefore i say to you [???] lady : stay ! for you
have no errand to the south . '
' neither have those others who go with thee . they go only because they
would not be parted from thee - because they love thee . ' then she turned and
vanished into the night .
when the light of day was come into the sky but the sun was not yet
risen above the high ridges in the east [???] [???] made ready to depart . his
company was all mounted [???] and he was about to leap into the saddle [???] when the
lady [???] came to bid them farewell . she was clad as a rider and girt with
a sword . in her hand she bore a cup [???] and she set it to her lips and drank a
little [???] wishing them good speed ; and then she gave the cup to [???] [???] and
he drank [???] and he said : ' farewell [???] lady of [???] ! i drink to the fortunes of
your house [???] and of you [???] and of all your people . say to your brother : beyond
the shadows we may meet again ! '
then it seemed to [???] and legolas who were nearby that she wept [???] and
in one so stern and proud that seemed the more grievous . but she said :
' [???] [???] wilt thou go ? '
' i will [???] ' he said .
' then wilt thou not let me ride with this company [???] as i have asked ? '
' i will not [???] lady [???] ' he said . ' for that i could not grant without leave
of the king and of your brother ; and they will not return until tomorrow .
but i count now every hour [???] indeed every minute . farewell ! '
then she fell on her knees [???] saying : ' i beg thee ! '
' nay [???] lady [???] ' he said [???] and taking her by the hand he raised her . then he
kissed her hand [???] and sprang into the saddle [???] and rode away [???] and did not look
back ; and only those who knew him well and were near to him saw the pain
that he bore .
but [???] stood still as a figure carven in stone [???] her hands [???]
at her sides [???] and she watched them until they passed into the shadows under
the black [???] [???] the haunted mountain [???] in which was the gate of the
dead . when they were lost to view [???] she turned [???] stumbling as one that is
blind [???] and went back to her lodging . but none of her folk saw this parting [???]
for they hid themselves in fear and would not come forth until the day was

up [???] and the reckless strangers were gone .
and some said : ' they are elvish [???] . let them go where they belong [???]
into the dark places [???] and never return . the times are evil enough . '
the light was still grey as they rode [???] for the sun had not yet climbed
over the black ridges of the haunted mountain before them . a dread fell on
them [???] even as they passed between the lines of ancient stones and so came to
the [???] . there under the gloom of black trees that not even legolas
could long endure they found a hollow place opening at the mountain ' s root [???]
and right in their path stood a single mighty stone like a finger of doom .
' my blood runs chill [???] ' said [???] [???] but the others were silent [???] and his
voice fell dead on the dank fir - needles at his feet . the horses would not
pass the threatening stone [???] until the riders [???] and led them about .
and so they came at last deep into the glen ; and there stood a sheer wall of
rock [???] and in the wall the dark door gaped before them like the mouth of
night . signs and figures were carved above its wide arch too dim to read [???]
and fear flowed from it like a grey vapour .
the company halted [???] and there was not a heart among them that did not
quail [???] unless it were the heart of legolas of the elves [???] for whom the ghosts
of men have no terror .
' this is an evil door [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and my death lies beyond it . i
will dare to pass it nonetheless ; but no horse will enter . '
' but we must go in [???] and therefore the horses must go too [???] ' said
[???] . ' for if ever we come through this darkness [???] many leagues lie
beyond [???] and every hour that is lost there will bring the triumph of [???]
nearer . follow me ! '
then [???] led the way [???] and such was the strength of his will in that
hour that all the d [???] nedain and their horses followed him . and indeed the
love that the horses of the rangers bore for their riders was so great that
they were willing to face even the terror of the door [???] if their masters '
hearts were steady as they walked beside them . but arod [???] the horse of [???] [???]
refused the way [???] and he stood sweating and trembling in a fear that was
grievous to see . then legolas laid his hands on his eyes and sang some words
that went soft in the gloom [???] until he suffered himself to be led [???] and
legolas passed in . and there stood [???] the dwarf left all alone .
his knees shook [???] and he was wroth with himself . ' here is a thing
unheard of ! ' he said . ' an elf will go underground and a dwarf dare not ! '
with that he [???] in . but it seemed to him that he dragged his feet like

lead over the [???] ; and at once a blindness came upon him [???] even upon
[???] [???] ' s son who had walked [???] in many deep places of the world .
[???] had brought torches from [???] [???] and now he went ahead
bearing one aloft ; and [???] with another went at the rear [???] and [???] [???]
stumbling behind [???] strove to overtake him . he could see nothing but the dim
flame of the tor ches ; but if the company halted [???] there seemed an endless
whisper of voices all about him [???] a murmur of words in no tongue that he had
ever heard before .
nothing assailed the company nor [???] their passage [???] and yet
steadily fear grew on the dwarf as he went on : most of all because he knew
now that there could be no turning back ; all the paths behind were thronged
by an unseen host that followed in the dark .
so time [???] passed [???] until [???] saw a sight that he was ever
afterwards loth to recall . the road was wide [???] as far as he could judge [???] but
now the company came suddenly into a great empty space [???] and there were no
longer any walls upon either side . the dread was so heavy on him that he
could hardly walk . away to the left something glittered in the gloom as
[???] ' s torch drew near . then [???] halted and went to look what it
might be .
' does he feel no fear ? ' muttered the dwarf . ' in any other cave [???]
[???] ' s son would have been the first to run to the gleam of gold . but not
here ! let it lie ! '
nonetheless he drew near [???] and saw [???] kneeling [???] while [???] held
aloft both torches . before him were the bones of a mighty man . he had been
clad in mail [???] and still his harness lay there whole ; for the cavern ' s air
was as dry as dust [???] and his [???] was gilded . his belt was of gold and
[???] [???] and rich with gold was the helm upon his bony head face downward on
the floor . he had fallen near the far wall of the cave [???] as now could be
seen [???] and before him stood a stony door closed fast : his finger - bones were
still [???] at the cracks . a notched and broken sword lay by him [???] as if he
had hewn at the rock in his last despair .
[???] did not touch him [???] but after gazing silently for a while he
rose and sighed . ' hither shall the flowers of [???] come never unto
world ' s end [???] ' he murmured . ' nine mounds and seven there are now green with
grass [???] and through all the long years he has lain at the door that he could
not unlock . whither does it lead ? why would he pass ? none shall ever know !
' for that is not my errand ! ' he cried [???] turning back and speaking to the

whispering darkness behind . ' keep your hoards and your secrets hidden in the
accursed years ! speed only we ask . let us pass [???] and then come ! i summon
you
to the stone of erech ! '
there was no answer [???] unless it were an utter silence more dreadful than
the whispers before ; and then a chill blast came in which the torches
[???] and went out [???] and could not be [???] . of the time that
followed [???] one hour or many [???] [???] remembered little . the others pressed on [???]
but he was ever hindmost [???] pursued by a groping horror that seemed always
just about to seize him ; and a rumour came after him lik e the shadow - sound
of many feet . he [???] on until he was [???] like a beast on the
ground and felt that he could endure no more : he must either find an ending
and escape or run back in madness to meet the following fear .
suddenly he heard the tinkle of water [???] a sound hard and clear as a
stone falling into a dream of dark shadow . light grew [???] and lo ! the company
passed through another gateway [???] high - arched and broad [???] and a rill ran out
beside them ; and beyond [???] going steeply down [???] was a road between sheer
cliffs [???] knife - edged against the sky far above . so deep and narrow was that
chasm that the sky was dark [???] and in it small stars glinted . yet as [???]
after learned it was still two hours ere sunset of the day on which they had
set out from [???] ; though for all that he could then tell it might have
been [???] in some later year [???] or in some other world .
the company now mounted again [???] and [???] returned to legolas . they
rode
in file [???] and evening came on and a deep blue [???] ; and still fear pursued
them . legolas turning to speak to [???] looked back and the dwarf saw before
his face the glitter in the elf ' s bright eyes . behind them rode [???] [???]
last of the company [???] but not the last of those that took the downward road .
' the dead are following [???] ' said legolas . ' i see shapes of men and of
horses [???] and pale banners like shreds of cloud [???] and spears like
winter - thickets on a misty night . the dead are following . '
' yes [???] the dead ride behind . they have been summoned [???] ' said [???] .
the company came at last out of the ravine [???] as suddenly as it they had
issued from a crack in a wall ; and there lay the [???] of a great vale
before them [???] and the stream beside them went down with a cold voice over
many falls .
' where in middle - earth are we ? ' said [???] ; and [???] answered : ' we

have descended from the [???] of the [???] [???] the long chill river that
flows at last to the sea that washes the walls of dol amroth . you will not
need to ask hereafter how comes its name : [???] men call it . '
the [???] vale made a great bay that beat up against the sheer
southern faces of the mountains . its steep [???] were grass - grown ; but all
was grey in that hour [???] for the sun had gone [???] and far below lights [???]
in the homes of men . the vale was rich and many folk dwelt there .
then without turning [???] cried aloud so that all could hear :
' friends [???] forget your weariness ! ride now [???] ride ! we must come to the stone
of erech ere this day passes [???] and long still is the way . ' so without looking
back they rode the mountain - fields [???] until they came to a bridge over the
growing torrent and found a road that went down into the land .
lights went out in house and hamlet as they came [???] and doors were shut [???]
and folk that were afield cried in terror and ran wild like hunted deer .
ever there rose the same cry in the gathering night : ' the king of the dead !
the king of the dead is come upon us ! '
bells wer e ringing far below [???] and all men fled before the face of
[???] ; but the grey company in their haste rode like hunters [???] until their
horses were stumbling with weariness . and thus [???] just ere midnight [???] and in a
darkness as black as the [???] in the mountains [???] they came at last to the
hill of erech .
long had the terror of the dead lain upon that hill and upon the empty
fields about it . for upon the top stood a black stone [???] round as a great
globe [???] the height of a man [???] though its half was buried in the ground .
[???] it looked [???] as though it had fallen from the sky [???] as some believed ;
but those who remembered still the lore of westernesse told that it had been
brought out of the ruin of n [???] menor and there set by [???] at his landing .
none of the people of the valley dared to approach it [???] nor would they dwell
near ; for they said that it was a [???] - place of the shadow - men [???] and
there they would gather in times of fear [???] thronging round the stone and
whispering .
to tha t stone the company came and halted in the dead of night . then
[???] gave to [???] a silver horn [???] and he blew upon it and it seemed to
those that stood near that they heard a sound of answering horns [???] as if it
was an echo in deep caves far away . no other sound they heard [???] and yet they
were aware of a great host gathered all about the hill on which they stood ;
and a chill wind like the breath of ghosts came down from the mountains . but

[???] [???] [???] and standing by the stone he cried in a great voice :
' [???] [???] why have ye come ? '
and a voice was heard out of the night that answered him [???] as if from
far away :
' to fulfil our oath and have peace . '
then [???] said : ' the hour is come at last . now i go to [???] upon
[???] [???] and ye shall come after me . and when all this land is clean of the
servants of [???] [???] i will hold the oath fulfilled [???] and ye shall have peace
and depart for ever . for i am [???] [???] [???] ' s heir of [???] . '
and with that he bade [???] [???] the great standard which he had
brought ; and behold ! it was black [???] and if there was any device upon it [???] it
was hidden in the darkness . then there was silence [???] and not a whisper nor a
sigh was heard again all the long night . the company camped beside the
stone [???] but they slept little [???] because of the dread of the shadows that
hedged them round .
but when the dawn came [???] cold and pale [???] [???] rose at once [???] and he led
the company forth upon the journey of greatest haste and weariness that any
among them had known [???] save he alone [???] and only his will held them to go on .
no other mortal men could have endured it [???] none but the d [???] nedain of the
north [???] and with them [???] the dwarf and legolas of the elves .
they passed [???] ' s neck and came into [???] ; and the shadow
host
pressed behind and fear went on before them [???] until they came to [???]
upon [???] [???] and the sun went down like blood behind [???] gelin away in
the west behind them . the township and the fords of [???] they found
deserted [???] for many men had gone away to war [???] and all that were left fled to
the hills at the rumour of the coming of the king of the dead . but the next
day there came no dawn [???] and the grey company passed on into the darkness
of
the storm of [???] and were lost to mortal sight ; but the dead followed
them .




chapter 3 . the muster of [???]



now all roads were running together to the east to meet the coming of
war and the onset of the shadow . and even as [???] stood at the great gate
of the city and saw the prince of dol amroth ride in with his banners [???] the
king of [???] came down out of the hills .
day was waning . in the last rays of the sun the riders cast long
pointed shadows that went on before them . darkness had already crept beneath
the murmuring fir - woods that clothed the steep mountain - sides . the king rode
now slowly at the end of the day . presently the path turned round a huge
bare shoulder of rock and [???] into the gloom of soft - sighing trees .
down [???] down they went in a long winding file . when at last they came to the
bottom of the gorge they found that evening had fallen in the deep places .
the sun was gone . [???] lay upon the [???] .
all day far below them a leaping stream had run down from the high pass
behind [???] cleaving its narrow way between pine - clad walls ; and now through a
stony gate it flowed out and passed into a wider vale . the riders followed
it [???] and suddenly [???] lay before them [???] loud with the noise of waters
in the evening . there the white [???] [???] joined by the lesser stream [???] went
rushing [???] [???] on the stones [???] down to [???] and the green hills and the
plains . away to the right at the head of the great dale the mighty [???]
loomed up above its vast [???] [???] in cloud ; but its jagged peak [???]
clothed in everlasting snow [???] gleamed far above the world [???] blue - shadowed upon
the east [???] red - stained by the sunset in the west .
merry looked out in wonder upon this strange country [???] of which he had
heard many tales upon their long road . it was a skyless world [???] in which his
eye ; through dim gulfs of shadowy air [???] saw only ever - mounting [???] [???] great
walls of stone behind great walls [???] and frowning [???] wreathed with
mist . he sat for a moment half dreaming [???] listening to the noise of water [???]
the whisper of dark trees [???] the crack of stone [???] and the vast waiting silence
that brooded behind all sound . he loved mountains [???] or he had loved the
thought of them marching on the edge of stories brought from far away ; but
now he was borne down by the [???] weight of middle - earth . he
longed
to shut out the [???] in a quiet room by a fire .
he was very tired [???] for though they had ridden slowly [???] they had ridden

with very little rest . hour after hour for nearly three weary days he had
jogged up and down [???] over passes [???] and through long dales [???] and across many
streams . sometimes where the way was broader he had ridden at the king ' s
side [???] not noticing that many of the riders smiled to see the two together :
the hobbit on his little [???] grey pony [???] and the lord of [???] on his
great white horse . then he had talked to [???] [???] telling him about his home
and the doings of the shire - folk [???] or listening in turn to tales of the mark
and its mighty men of old . but most of the time [???] especially on this last
day [???] merry had ridden by himself just behind the king [???] saying nothing [???] and
trying to understand the slow sonorous speech of [???] that he heard the men
behind him using . it was a language in which there seemed to be many words
that he knew [???] though spoken more richly and strongly than in the shire [???] yet
he could not piece the words together . at times some rider would lift up his
clear voice in stirring song [???] and merry felt his heart leap [???] though he did
not know what it was about .
all the same he had been lonely [???] and never more so than now at the
day ' s end . he wondered where in all this strange world [???] had got to ;
and what would become of [???] and legolas and [???] . then suddenly
like a
cold touch on his heart he thought of [???] and sam . ' i am forgetting them ! '
he said to himself reproachfully . ' and yet they are more important than all
the rest of us . and i came to help them ; but now they must be hundreds of
miles away [???] if they are still alive . ' he shivered .
' [???] at last ! ' said jomer . ' our journey is almost at an end . '
they halted . the paths out of the narrow gorge fell steeply . only a glimpse [???]
as through a tall window [???] could be seen of the great valley in the gloaming
below . a single small light could be seen [???] by the river .
' this journey is over [???] maybe [???] ' said [???] [???] ' but i have far yet to go .
last night the moon was full [???] and in the morning i shall ride to [???] to
the gathering of the mark . '
' but if you would take my counsel [???] ' said jomer in a low voice [???] ' you
would then return hither [???] until the war is over [???] lost or won . '
[???] smiled . ' nay [???] my son [???] for so i will call you [???] speak not the
soft words of [???] in my old ears ! ' he drew himself up and looked
back
at the long line of his men fading into the [???] behind . ' long years in the
space of days it seems since i rode west ; but never will i lean on a staff

again . if the war is lost [???] what good will be my hiding in the hills ? and if
it is won [???] what grief will it be [???] even if i fall [???] spending my last strength ?
but we will leave this now . tonight i will lie in the hold of [???] . one
evening of peace at least is left us . let us ride on ! '
in the deepening [???] they came down into the valley . here the
[???] flowed near to the western walls of the dale [???] and soon the path
led them to a ford where the shallow waters murmured loudly on the stones .
the ford was guarded . as the king approached many men sprang up out of the
shadow of the rocks ; and when they saw the king they cried with glad voices :
' [???] king ! [???] king ! the king of the mark returns ! '
then one blew a long call on a horn . it echoed in the valley . other
horns answered it [???] and lights shone out across the river .
and suddenly there rose a great chorus of trumpets from high above [???]
sounding from some hollow place [???] as it seemed [???] that gathered their notes
into one voice and sent it rolling and beating on the walls of stone .
so the king of the mark came back victorious out of the west to
[???] beneath the feet of the white mountains . there he found the
remaining strength of his people already assembled ; for as soon as his
coming was known captains rode to meet him at the ford [???] bearing messages
from [???] . d [???] nhere [???] chieftain of the folk of [???] [???] was at their
head .
' at dawn three days ago [???] lord [???] ' he said . ' [???] came like a wind
out of the west to [???] [???] and [???] brought tidings of your victory to
gladden our hearts . but he brought also word from you to hasten the
gathering of the riders . and then came the winged shadow . '
' the winged shadow ? ' said [???] . ' we saw it also [???] but that was in the
dead of night before [???] left us . '
' maybe [???] lord [???] ' said d [???] nhere . ' yet the same [???] or another like to it [???] a
flying darkness in the shape of a monstrous bird [???] passed over [???] that
morning [???] and all men were shaken with fear . for it stooped upon [???] [???]
and as it came low [???] almost to the gable [???] there came a cry that stopped our
hearts . then it was that [???] counselled us not to assemble in the
fields [???] but to meet you here in the valley under the mounta ins . and he bade
us to kindle no more lights or fires than barest need asked . so it has been
done . [???] spoke with great authority . we trust that it is as you would
wish . naught has been seen in [???] of these evil things . '
' it is well [???] ' said [???] . ' i will ride now to the hold [???] and there

before i go to rest i will meet the marshals and captains . let them come to
me as soon as may be ! '
the road now led eastward straight across the valley [???] which was at that
point little more than half a mile in width . flats and meads of rough grass [???]
grey now in the falling night [???] lay all about [???] but in front on the far side
of the dale merry saw a frowning wall [???] a last outlier of the great roots of
the [???] [???] cloven by the river in ages past .
on all the level spaces there was great concourse of men . some thronged
to the roadside [???] hailing the king and the riders from the west with glad
cries ; but stretching away into the distance behind there were ordered rows
of tents and [???] [???] and lines of [???] horses [???] and great store of arms [???]
and piled spears [???] like thickets of new - planted trees . now all the
great assembly was falling into shadow [???] and yet [???] though the night - chill blew
cold from the heights no lanterns glowed [???] no fires were lit . watchmen
heavily cloaked paced to and fro .
merry wondered how many riders there were . he could not guess their
number in the gathering gloom [???] but it looked to him like a great army [???] many
thousands strong . while he was peering from side to side the king ' s party
came up under the looming cliff on the eastern side of the valley ; and there
suddenly the path began to climb [???] and merry looked up in amazement . he
was
on a road the like of which he had never seen before [???] a great work of men ' s
hands in years beyond the reach of song . upwards it wound [???] coiling like a
snake [???] boring its way across the sheer slope of rock . steep as a stair [???] it
looped backwards and forwards as it climbed . up it horses could walk [???] and
wains could be slowly hauled ; but no enemy could come that way [???] except out
of the air [???] if it was defended from above . at each turn of the road there
were great standing stones that had been carved in the likeness of men [???] huge
and [???] - limbed [???] [???] cross - legged with their [???] arms folded on
fat bellies . some in the wearing of the years had lost all features save the
dark holes of their eyes that still stared sadly at the passers - by . the
riders hardly glanced at them . the p [???] kel - men they called them [???] and heeded
them little : no power or terror was left in them ; but merry gazed at them
with wonder and a feeling almost of pity [???] as they loomed up mournfully in
the [???] .
after a while he looked back and found that he had already climbed some
hundreds of feet above the valley [???] but still far below he could dimly see a

winding line of riders crossing the ford and filing along the road towards
the camp prepared for them . only the king and his guard were going up into
the hold .
at last the king ' s company came to a sharp brink [???] and the climbing road
passed into a cutting between walls of rock [???] and so went up a short slope
and out on to a wide upland . the [???] men called it [???] a green
mountain - field of grass and heath [???] high above the deep - delved courses of the
[???] [???] laid upon the lap of the great mountains behind : the [???]
southwards [???] and northwards the saw - toothed mass of [???] [???] between which
there faced the riders [???] the grim black wall of the [???] [???] the haunted
mountain rising out of steep [???] of [???] pines . dividing the upland
into two there marched a double line of [???] standing stones that
[???] into the [???] and vanished in the trees . those who dared to follow
that road came soon to the black [???] under [???] [???] and the menace
of
the pillar of stone [???] and the yawning shadow of the forbidden door .
such was the dark [???] [???] the work of long - forgotten men . their name
was lost and no song or legend remembered it . for what purpose they had
made
this place [???] as a town or secret temple or a tomb of kings [???] none could say .
here they laboured in the dark years [???] before ever a ship came to the western
shores [???] or [???] of the d [???] nedain was built ; and now they had vanished [???] and
only the old p [???] kel - men were left [???] still sitting at the turnings of the road .
merry stared at the lines of marching stones : they were worn and black ;
some were leaning [???] some were fallen [???] some cracked or broken ; they looked
like rows of old and hungry teeth . he wondered what they could be [???] and he
hoped that the king was not going to follow them into the darkness beyond .
then he saw that there were [???] of tents and [???] on either side of
the stony way ; but these were not set near the trees [???] and seemed rather to
[???] away from them towards the brink of the cliff . the greater number
were on the right [???] where the [???] was wider ; and on the left there was
a smaller camp [???] in the midst of which stood a tall [???] . from this side
a rider now came out to meet them [???] and they turned from the road .
as they drew near merry saw that the rider was a woman with long
braided hair gleaming in the [???] [???] yet she wore a helm and was clad to
the waist like a warrior and girded with a sword .
' hail [???] lord of the mark ! ' she cried . ' my heart is glad at your

returning . '
' and you [???] [???] [???] ' said [???] [???] ' is all well with you ? '
' all is well [???] ' she answered ; yet it seemed to merry that her voice
belied her [???] and he would have thought that she had been weeping [???] if that
could be believed of one so stern of face . ' all is well . it was a weary road
for the people to take [???] torn suddenly from their homes . there were hard
words [???] for it is long since war has driven us from the green fields ; but
there have been no evil deeds . all is now ordered [???] as you see . and your
lodging is prepared for you ; for i have had full tidings of you and knew the
hour of your coming . '
' so [???] has come then [???] ' said jomer . ' is he still here ? '
' no [???] he is gone [???] ' said [???] turning away and looking at the mountains
dark against the east and south .
' whither did he go ? ' asked jomer .
' i do not know [???] ' she answered . ' he came at night [???] and rode away
[???] [???] ere the sun had climbed over the mountain - tops . he is gone . '
' you are grieved [???] daughter [???] ' said [???] . ' what has happened ? tell me [???]
did he speak of that road ? ' he pointed away along the darkening lines of
stones towards the [???] . ' of the paths of the dead ? '
' yes [???] lord [???] ' said [???] . ' and he has passed into the shadows from which
none have returned . i could not [???] him . he is gone . '
' then our paths are sundered [???] ' said jomer . ' he is lost . we must ride
without him [???] and our hope [???] . '
slowly they passed through the short heath and upland grass [???] speaking
no more [???] until they came to the king ' s [???] . there merry found that
everything was made ready [???] and that he himself was not forgotten . a little
tent had been pitched for him beside the king ' s lodging ; and there he sat
alone [???] while men passed to and fro [???] going in to the king and taking counsel
with him . night came on [???] and the half - seen heads of the mountains westward
were crowned with stars [???] but the east was dark and blank . the marching
stones faded slowly from sight [???] but still beyond them [???] blacker than the
gloom [???] brooded the vast [???] shadow of the [???] .
' the paths of the dead [???] ' he muttered to himself . ' the paths of the
dead ? what does all this mean ? they have all left me now . they have all gone
to some doom : [???] and [???] to war in the east ; and sam and [???] to
[???] ; and strider and legolas and [???] to the paths of the dead . but my
turn will come soon enough [???] i suppose . i wonder what they are all talking

about [???] and what the king means to do . for i must go where he goes now . '
in the midst of these gloomy thoughts he suddenly remembered that he
was very hungry [???] and he got up to go and see if anyone else in this strange
camp felt the same . but at that very moment a trumpet sounded [???] and a man
came summoning him [???] the king ' s esquire [???] to wait at the king ' s board .
in the inner part of the [???] was a small space [???] curtained off with
[???] hangings [???] and strewn with skins : and there at a small table sat
[???] with jomer and [???] [???] and d [???] nhere [???] lord of [???] . merry
stood
beside the king ' s stool and waited on him till presently the old man [???] coming
out of deep thought [???] turned to him and smiled .
' come [???] master [???] ! ' he said . ' you shall not stand . you shall sit
beside me [???] as long as i remain in my own lands [???] and lighten my heart with
tales . '
room was made for the hobbit at the king ' s left hand [???] but no one called
for any tale . there was indeed little speech [???] and they ate and drank for the
most part in silence [???] until at last [???] plucking up courage [???] merry asked the
question that was tormenting him .
' twice now [???] lord [???] i have heard of the paths of the dead [???] ' he said .
' what are they ? and where has strider [???] i mean the lord [???] where has he
gone ? '
the king sighed [???] but no one answered [???] until at last jomer spoke . ' we do
not know [???] and our hearts are heavy [???] ' he said . ' but as for the paths of the
dead [???] you have yourself walked on their first steps . nay . i speak no words
of ill omen ! the road that we have climbed is the approach to the door [???]
yonder in the [???] . but what lies beyond no man knows . '
' no man knows [???] ' said [???] : ' yet ancient legend [???] now seldom spoken [???]
has somewhat to report . if these old tales speak true that have come down
from father to son in the house of [???] [???] then the door under [???]
leads to a secret way that goes beneath the mountain to some forgotten end .
but none have ever ventured in to search its secrets [???] since baldor [???] son of
brego [???] passed the door and was never seen among men again . a rash vow
he
spoke [???] as he drained the horn at that feast which brego made to hallow
new - built [???] [???] and he came never to the high seat of which he was the
heir .
' folk say that dead men out of the dark years guard the way and will

suffer no living man to come to their hidden halls ; but at whiles they may
themselves be seen passing out of the door like shadows and down the stony
road . then the people of [???] shut fast their doors and shroud their
windows and are afraid . but the dead come seldom forth and only at times of
great unquiet and coming death . '
' yet it is said in [???] [???] ' said [???] in a low voice . ' that in the
moonless nights but little while ago a great host in strange array passed
by . whence they came none knew [???] but they went up the stony road and
vanished
into the hill [???] as if they went to keep a tryst . '
' then why has [???] gone that way ? ' asked merry . ' don ' t you know
anything that would explain it ? '
' unless he has spoken words to you as his friend that we have not
heard [???] ' said jomer [???] ' none now in the land of the living can tell his
purpose . '
' greatly changed he seemed to me since i saw him first in the king ' s
house [???] ' said [???] : ' grimmer [???] older . fey i thought him [???] and like one whom
the dead call . '
' maybe he was called [???] ' said [???] ; ' and my heart tells me that i
shall not see him again . yet he is a kingly man of high destiny . and take
comfort in this [???] daughter [???] since comfort you seem to need in your grief for
this guest . it is said that when the [???] came out of the north and
passed at length up the [???] [???] seeking strong places of [???] in time
of need [???] brego and his son baldor climbed the stair of the hold and so came
before the door . on the [???] sat an old man [???] aged beyond guess of
years ; tall and kingly he had been [???] but now he was withered as an old stone .
indeed for stone they took him [???] for he moved not [???] and he said no word [???] until
they sought to pass him by and enter . and then a voice came out of him [???] as
it were out of the ground [???] and to their amaze it spoke in the western
tongue : the way is shut .
' then they halted and looked at him and saw that he lived still ; but he
did not look at them . the way is shut [???] his voice said again it was made by
those who are dead [???] and the dead keep it [???] until the time comes . the way is
shut .
' and when will that time be ? said baldor . but no answer did he ever
get . for the old man died in that hour and fell upon his face ; and no other
tidings of the ancient dwellers in the mountains have our folk ever learned .

yet maybe at last the time foretold has come [???] and [???] may pass . '
' but how shall a man discover whether that time be come or no [???] save by
daring the door ? ' said jomer . ' and that way i would not go though all the
hosts of [???] stood before me [???] and i were alone and had no other [???] .
alas that a fey mood should fall on a man so [???] in this hour of
need ! are there not evil things enough abroad without seeking them under the
earth ? war is at hand . '
he paused [???] for at that moment there was a noise outside [???] a man ' s voice
crying the name of [???] [???] and the challenge of the guard .
presently the captain of the guard thrust aside the curtain . ' a man is
here [???] lord [???] ' he said [???] ' an errand - rider of [???] . he wishes to come before
you at once . '
' let him come ! ' said [???] .
a tall man entered [???] and merry choked back a cry ; for a moment it seemed
to him that [???] was alive again and had returned . then he saw that it
was not so ; the man was a stranger [???] though as like to [???] as if he were
one of his kin [???] tall and grey - eyed and proud . he was clad as a rider with a
cloak of dark green over a coat of fine mail ; on the front of his helm was
wrought a small silver star . in his hand he bore a single arrow [???]
black - feathered and barbed with steel [???] but the point was painted red .
he sank on one knee and presented the arrow to [???] . ' hail lord of
the [???] [???] friend of [???] ! ' he said . ' [???] i am [???] errand - rider of
[???] [???] who bring you this token of war . [???] is in great need . often
the [???] have aided us [???] but now the lord [???] asks for all your
strength and all your speed ; lest [???] fall at last . '
' the red arrow ! ' said [???] [???] holding it [???] as one who receives a
summons long expected and yet dreadful when it comes . his hand trembled .
' the red arrow has not been seen in the mark in all my years ! has it indeed
come to that ? and what does the lord [???] reckon that all my strength
and all my speed may be ? '
' that is best known to yourself [???] lord [???] ' said [???] . ' but ere long it
may well come to pass that minas [???] is surrounded [???] and unless you have
the strength to break a siege of many powers [???] the lord [???] bids me say
that he judges that the strong arms of the [???] would be better within
his walls than without . '
' but he knows that we are a people who fight rather upon [???] and
in the open [???] and that we are also a scattered people and time is needed for

the gathering of our riders . is it not true [???] [???] [???] that the lord of minas
[???] knows more than he sets in his message ? for we are already at war [???] as
you may have seen [???] and you do not find us all [???] . [???] the grey
has been among us [???] and even now we are mustering for battle in the ea st . '
' what the lord [???] may know or guess of all these things i cannot
say [???] ' answered [???] . ' but indeed our case is desperate . my lord does not
issue any command to you [???] he begs you only to remember old friendship and
oaths long spoken [???] and for your own good to do all that you may . it is
reported to us that many kings have ridden in from the east to the service
of [???] . from the north to the field of [???] there is [???] and
rumour of war . in the south the [???] are moving [???] and fear has fallen on
all our [???] [???] so that little help will come to us thence . make haste !
for it is before the walls of minas [???] that the doom of our time will be
decided [???] and if the tide be not [???] there [???] then it will flow over all
the fair fields of [???] [???] and even in this hold among the hills there shall
be no [???] . '
' dark tidings [???] ' said [???] [???] ' yet not all [???] . but say to
[???] that even if [???] itself felt no peril [???] still we would come to his
aid . but we have suffered much loss in our battles with [???] the traitor [???]
and we must still think of our frontier to the north and east [???] as his own
tidings make clear . so great a power as the dark lord seems now to wield
might well contain us in battle before the city and yet strike with great
force across the river away beyond the gate of kings .
' but we will speak no longer counsels of [???] . we will come . the
[???] was set for the morrow . when all is ordered we will set out . ten
thousand spears i might have sent riding over the plain to the dismay of
your foes . it will be less now [???] i fear ; for i will not leave my [???]
all [???] . yet six thousands at the least shall ride behind me . for say
to [???] that in this hour the king of the mark himself will come down to
the land of [???] [???] though maybe he will not ride back . but it is a long
road [???] and man and beast must reach the end with strength to fight . a week it
may be from tomorrow ' s morn ere you hear the cry of the sons of [???] coming
from the north .
' a week ! ' said [???] . ' if it must be so [???] it must . but you are like to
find only ruined walls in seven days from now [???] unless other help
[???] - for comes . still [???] you may at the least disturb the [???] and [???]
men from their feasting in the white tower . '

' at the least we will do that [???] ' said [???] . ' but i myself am new - come
from battle and long journey [???] and i will now go to rest . tarry here this
night . then you shall look on the muster of [???] and ride away the gladder
for the sight [???] and the swifter for the rest . in the morning counsels are
best [???] and night changes many thoughts .
with that the king stood up [???] and they all rose . ' go now each to your
rest . ' he said [???] ' and sleep well . and you [???] master [???] [???] i need no more
tonight . but be ready to my call as soon as the sun is risen . '
' i will be ready [???] ' said merry [???] ' even if you bid me ride with you on the
paths of the dead . '
' speak not words of omen ! ' said the k ing . ' for there may be more roads
than one that could bear that name . but i did not say that i would bid you
ride with me on any road . good night ! '
' i won ' t be left behind [???] to be called for on return ! ' said merry . ' i
won ' t be left [???] i won ' t . ' and repeating this over and over again to himself
he fell asleep at last in his tent .
he was wakened by a man shaking him . ' wake up [???] wake up . master
[???] ! ' he cried ; and at length merry came out of deep dreams and sat up
with a start . it still seemed very dark [???] he thought .
' what is the matter ? ' he asked .
' the king calls for you . '
' but the sun has not risen [???] yet [???] ' said merry .
' no [???] and will not rise today [???] master [???] . nor ever again [???] one
would think under this cloud . but time does not stand still [???] though the sun
be lost . make haste ! '
flinging on some clothes [???] merry looked outside . the world was darkling .
the very air seemed brown [???] and all things about were black and grey and
shadowless ; there was a great stillness . no shape of cloud could be seen [???]
unless it were far away westward [???] where the furthest groping fingers of the
great gloom still [???] onwards and a little light leaked through them .
overhead there hung a heavy roof [???] [???] and featureless [???] and light seemed
rather to be failing than growing .
merry saw many folk standing [???] looking up and muttering : all their faces
were grey and sad [???] and some were afraid . with a sinking heart he made his
way to the king . [???] the rider of [???] was there before him [???] and beside
him stood now another man [???] like him and dressed alike [???] but shorter and
broader . as merry entered he was speaking to the king .

' it comes from [???] [???] lord [???] ' he said . ' it began last night at sunset .
from the hills in the eastfold of your realm i saw it rise and creep across
the sky [???] and all night as i rode it came behind eating up the stars . now the
great cloud hangs over all the land between here and the mountains of
shadow ; and it is deepening . war has a lready begun . '
for a while the king sat silent . at last he spoke . ' so we come to it in
the end [???] ' he said : ' the great battle of our time [???] in which many things shall
pass away . but at least there is no longer need for hiding . we will ride the
straight way and the open road and with all our speed . the muster shall
begin at once [???] and wait for none that tarry . have you good store in minas
[???] ? for if we must ride now in all haste [???] then we must ride light [???] with
but meal and water enough to last u s into battle . '
' we have very great store long prepared [???] ' answered [???] . ride now as
light and as swift as you may ! '
' then call the heralds [???] jomer [???] ' said [???] . ' let the riders be
marshalled ! '
jomer went out [???] and presently the trumpets rang in the hold and were
answered by many others from below ; but their voices no longer sounded clear
and brave as they had seemed to merry the night before . dull they seemed and
harsh in the heavy air [???] braying [???] .
the king turned to merry . ' i am going to war [???] master [???] [???] ' he
said . ' in a little while i shall take the road . i release you from my
service [???] but not from my friendship . you shall abide here [???] and if you will [???]
you shall serve the lady [???] [???] who will govern the folk in my stead . '
' but [???] but [???] lord [???] ' merry [???] [???] ' i offered you my sword . i do not
want to be parted from you like this [???] [???] king . and as all my friends
have gone to the battle ' i should be ashamed to stay behind . '
' but we ride on horses tall and swift [???] ' said [???] ; ' and great though
your heart be [???] you cannot ride on such beasts . '
' then tie me on to the back of one [???] or let me hang on a stirrup [???] or
something [???] ' said merry . ' it is a long way to run ; but run i shall [???] if i
cannot ride [???] even if i wear my feet off and arrive weeks too late . '
[???] smiled . ' rather than that i would bear you with me on
[???] [???] ' he said . ' but at the least you shall ride with me to [???] and
look on [???] ; for that way i shall go . so far [???] can bear you : the
great race will not begin till we reach the plains . '
then [???] rose up . ' come now [???] [???] ! ' she said . ' i will show you

the gear that i have prepared fur you . ' they went out together . ' this
request only did [???] make to me [???] ' said [???] [???] as they passed among the
tents [???] ' that you should be armed for battle . i have granted it [???] as i could .
for my heart tells me that you will need such gear ere the end . '
now she led merry to a booth among the lodges of the king ' s guard and
there an armourer brought out to her a small helm [???] and a round shield [???] and
other gear .
' no mail have we to fit you [???] ' said [???] [???] ' nor any time for the forging
of such a [???] ; but here is also a stout jerkin of leather [???] a belt [???] and a
knife . a sword you have . '
merry bowed [???] and the lady showed him the shield [???] which was like the
shield that had been given to [???] [???] and it bore on it the device of the
white horse . ' take all these things [???] ' she said [???] ' and bear them to good
fortune ! farewell now [???] master [???] ! yet maybe we shall meet again [???] you
and i . '
so it was that amid a gathering gloom the king of the mark made ready
to lead all his riders on the eastward road . hearts were heavy and many
[???] in the shadow . but they were a stern people [???] loyal to their lord [???]
and little weeping or murmuring was heard [???] even in the camp in the hold
where the exiles from [???] were housed [???] women and children and old men .
doom hung over them [???] but they faced it silently .
two swift hours passed [???] and now the king sat upon his white horse [???]
[???] in the half light . proud and tall he seemed [???] though the hair that
flowed beneath his high helm was like snow ; and many marvelled a t him and
took heart to see him unbent and [???] .
there on the wide flats beside the noisy river were marshalled in many
companies well nigh five and fifty hundreds of riders fully armed [???] and many
hundreds of other men with spare horses lightly burdened . a single trumpet
sounded . the king raised his hand [???] and then silently the host of the mark
began to move . foremost went twelve of the king ' s household - men [???] riders of
renown . then the king followed with jomer on his right . he had said farewell
to [???] above in the hold [???] and the memory was grievous ; but now he turned
his mind to the road that lay ahead . behind him merry rode on [???] with
the errand riders of [???] [???] and behind them again twelve more of the king ' s
household . they passed down the long ranks of waiting men with stern and
[???] faces . but when they had come almost to the end of the line one
looked up glancing keenly at the hobbit . a young man [???] merry thought as he

returned the glance [???] less in height and girth than most . he caught the glint
of clear grey eyes ; and then he shivered [???] for it came suddenly to him that
it was the face of one without hope who goes in search of death .
on down the grey road they went beside the [???] rushing on its
stones ; through the hamlets of [???] and [???] [???] where many sad
faces
of women looked out from dark doors ; and so without horn or harp or music of
men ' s voices the great ride into the east began with which the songs of
[???] were busy for many long lives of men thereafter .
from dark [???] in the dim morning
with thane and captain rode [???] ' s son :
to [???] he came [???] the ancient halls
of the mark - wardens mist - [???] ;
golden timbers were in gloom mantled .
farewell he bade to his free people [???]
hearth and high - seat [???] and the hallowed places [???]
where long he had feasted ere the light faded .
forth rode the king [???] fear behind him [???]
fate before him . fealty kept he ;
oaths he had taken [???] all fulfilled them .
forth rode [???] . five nights and days
east and onward rode the [???]
through folde and [???] and the [???] [???]
six thousand spears to [???] [???]
[???] the mighty under [???] [???]
sea - kings ' city in the south - kingdom
foe - [???] [???] fire - [???] .
doom drove them on . darkness took them [???]
horse and horseman ; [???] afar
sank into silence : so the songs tell us .
it was indeed in deepening gloom that the king came to [???] [???] although
it was then but noon by the hour . there he halted only a short while and
strengthened his host by some three score of riders that came late to the
[???] . now having eaten he made ready to set out again [???] and he wished
his esquire a kindly farewell . but merry begged for the last time not to be
parted from him .
' this is no journey for such steeds as [???] [???] as i have told you '

said [???] . ' and in such a battle as we think to make on the fields of
[???] what would you do [???] master [???] [???] sword - thain though you be [???]
and
greater of heart than of stature ? '
' as for that [???] who can tell ? ' answered merry . ' but why [???] lord [???] did you
receive me as sword - thain [???] if not to stay by your side ? and i would not have
it said of me in song only that i was always left behind ! '
' i received you for your safe - keeping [???] ' answered [???] ; ' and also to
do as i might bid . none of my riders can bear you as burden . if the battle
were before my gates [???] maybe your deeds would be remembered by the
[???] ;
but it is a hundred leagues and two to [???] where [???] is lord . i
will say no more . '
merry bowed and went away unhappily [???] and stared at the lines of
horsemen . already the companies were preparing to start : men were tightening
girths [???] looking to saddles [???] caressing their horses ; some gazed [???] at
the lowering sky . [???] a rider came up and spoke softly in the hobbit ' s
ear .
' where will wants not [???] a way opens [???] so we say [???] ' he whispered ; ' and so i
have found myself . ' merry looked up and saw that it was the young rider
whom
he had noticed in the morning . ' you wish to go whither the lord of the mark
goes : i see it in your face . '
' i do [???] ' said merry .
' then you shall go with me [???] ' said the rider . ' i will bear you before
me [???] under my cloak until we are far afield [???] and this darkness is yet darker .
such good will should not be denied . say no more to any man [???] but come ! '
' thank you indeed ! ' said merry . ' thank you [???] sir [???] though i do not know
your name . '
' do you not ? ' said the rider softly . ' then call me [???] . '
thus it came to pass that when the king set out [???] before [???] sat
[???] the hobbit [???] and the great grey steed [???] made little of the
burden ; for [???] was less in weight than many men [???] though lithe and
well - knit in frame .
on into the shadow they rode . in the willow - thickets where [???]
flowed into [???] [???] twelve leagues east of [???] [???] they camped that night .
and then on again through the folde ; and through the [???] [???] where to

their right great [???] climbed on the skirts of the hills under the
shades of dark [???] by the borders of [???] ; but away to their left
the mists lay on the marshes fed by the mouths of [???] . and as they rode
rumour came of war in the north . lone men [???] riding wild [???] brought word of foes
assailing their east - borders [???] of orc - hosts marching in the wold of [???] .
' ride on ! ride on ! ' cried jomer . ' too late now to turn aside . the fens
of [???] must guard our flank . haste now we need . ride on ! '
and so king [???] departed from his own realm [???] and mile by mile the
long road wound away [???] and the beacon hills marched past : [???] [???]
min - [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] . but their fires were quenched . all the lands
were grey and still ; and ever the shadow deepened before them [???] and hope
waned in every heart .




chapter 4 . the siege of [???]



[???] was roused by [???] . candles were lit in their chamber [???] for
only a dim [???] came through the windows ; the air was heavy as with
approaching thunder .
' what is the time ? ' said [???] yawning .
' past the second hour [???] ' said [???] . ' time to get up and make yourself
presentable . you are summoned to the lord of the city to learn your new
duties . '
' and will he provide breakfast ? '
' no ! i have provided it : all that you will get till noon . food is now
doled out by order . '
[???] looked ruefully at the small loaf and ( he thought ) very
[???] pat of butter which was set out for him [???] beside a cup of thin
milk . ' why did you bring me here ? ' he said .
' you know quite well [???] ' said [???] . ' to keep you out of mischief ; and
if you do not like being here [???] you can remember that you brought it on
yourself . ' [???] said no more .
before long he was walking with [???] once more down the cold
corridor to the door of the tower hall . there [???] sat in a grey gloom [???]
like an old patient spider [???] [???] thought : he did not seem to have moved
since the day before . he beckoned [???] to a seat [???] but [???] was left for
a while standing [???] . presently the old man turned to him :
' well [???] master [???] [???] i hope that you used yesterday to your profit [???]
and to your liking ? though i fear that the board is barer in this city than
you could wish . '
[???] had an uncomfortable feeling that most of what he had said or
done was somehow known to the lord of the city [???] and much was guessed of
what
he thought as well . he did not answer .
' what would you do in my service ? '
' i thought [???] sir [???] that you would tell me my duties . '
' i will [???] when i learn what you are fit for [???] ' said [???] . ' but that i
shall learn soonest [???] maybe [???] if i keep you beside me . the esquire of my
chamber has begged leave to go to the out - [???] [???] so you shall take his

place for a while . you shall wait on me [???] bear errands [???] and talk to me [???] if
war and council leave me any leisure . can you sing ? '
' yes [???] ' said [???] . ' well [???] yes [???] well enough for my own people . but we
have no songs fit for great halls and evil times [???] lord . we seldom sing of
anything more terrible than wind or rain . and most of my songs are about
things that make us laugh ; or about food and drink [???] of course . '
' and why should such songs be unfit for my halls [???] or for such hours as
these ? we who have lived long under the shadow may surely listen to echoes
from a land [???] by it ? then we may feel that our vigil was not
fruitless [???] though it may have been thank less . '
[???] ' s heart sank . he did not relish the idea of singing any song of
the shire to the lord of minas [???] [???] certainly not the comic ones that he
knew best ; they were too [???] well [???] rustic for such an occasion . he was however
spared the ordeal for the present . he was not commanded to sing . [???]
turned to [???] [???] asking questions about the [???] and their [???] [???]
and the position of jomer [???] the king ' s nephew . [???] marvelled at the amount
that the lord seemed to know about a people that lived far away [???] though it
must [???] he thought [???] be many years since [???] himself had ridden abroad .
presently [???] waved to [???] and dismissed him again for a while .
' go to the armouries of the [???] [???] ' he said [???] ' and get you there the livery
and gear of the tower . it will be ready . it was commanded yesterday . return
when you are clad ! '
it was as he said ; and [???] soon found himself arrayed in strange
garments [???] all of black and silver . he had a small [???] [???] its rings forged
of steel [???] maybe [???] yet black as jet ; and a high - crowned helm with small
raven - wings on either side [???] set with a silver star in the centre of the
circlet . above the mail was a short [???] of black [???] but [???] on the
breast in silver with the token of the tree . his old clothes were folded and
put away [???] but he was permitted to keep the grey cloak of [???] [???] though not
to wear it when on duty . he looked now [???] had he known it [???] verily [???] i
[???] [???] the prince of the halflings [???] that folk had called him ; but he
felt uncomfortable . and the gloom began to weigh on his spirits .
it was dark and dim all day . from the sunless dawn until evening the
heavy shadow had deepened [???] and all hearts in the city were oppressed . far
above a great cloud streamed slowly westward from the black land [???]
devouring
light [???] borne upon a wind of war ; but below the air was still and breathless [???]

as if all the vale of [???] waited for the onset of a ruinous storm .
about the eleventh hour [???] released at last for a while from service .
[???] came out and went in search of food and drink to cheer his heavy
heart and make his task of waiting more supportable . in the messes he met
[???] again [???] who had just come from an errand over the [???] out to
the guard - towers upon the causeway . together they strolled out to the walls ;
for [???] felt imprisoned [???] [???] and [???] even in the lofty [???] .
now they sat side by side again in the [???] looking eastward [???] where
they had eaten and talked the day before .
it was the sunset - hour [???] but the great pall had now stretched far into
the west [???] and only as it sank at last into the sea did the sun escape to
send out a brief farewell gleam before the night [???] even as [???] saw it a t
the cross - roads touching the head of the fallen king . but to the fields of
the [???] [???] under the shadow of [???] [???] there came no gleam : they were
brown and drear .
already it seemed years to [???] since he had sat there before [???] in
some half - forgotten time when he had still been a hobbit [???] a light - hearted
wanderer touched little by the perils he had passed through . now he was one
small soldier in a city preparing for a great assault [???] clad in the proud but
[???] manner of the tower of guard .
in some other time and place [???] might have been pleased with his
new array [???] but he knew now that he was taking part in no play ; he was in
deadly earnest the servant of a grim master in the greatest peril . the
[???] was burdensome [???] and the helm weighed upon his head . his cloak he
had
cast aside upon the seat . he turned his tired gaze away from the darkling
fields below and yawned [???] and then he sighed .
' you are weary of this day ? ' said [???] .
' yes [???] ' said [???] [???] ' very : tired out with idleness and waiting . i have
kicked my heels at the door of my master ' s chamber for many slow hours [???]
while he has debated with [???] and the prince and other great persons .
and i ' m not used [???] master [???] [???] to waiting hungry on others while they
eat . it is a sore trial for a hobbit [???] that . no doubt you will think i should
feel the honour more deeply . but what is the good of such honour ? indeed
what is the good even of food and drink under this creeping shadow ? what
does it mean ? the very air seems thick and brown ! do you often have such
[???] when the wind is in the east ? '

' nay [???] ' said [???] [???] ' this is no weather of the world . this is some
device of his malice ; some broil of fume from the mountain of fire that he
sends to darken hearts and counsel . and so it doth indeed . i wish the lord
[???] would return . he would not be dismayed . but now [???] who knows if he
will ever come back across the river out of the darkness ? '
' yes [???] ' said [???] [???] ' [???] [???] too [???] is anxious . he was disappointed . i
think [???] not to find [???] here . and where has he got to himself ? he left
the lord ' s council before the noon - meal [???] and in no good mood either [???] i
thought . perhaps he has some [???] of bad news . '
suddenly as they talked they were [???] dumb [???] frozen as it were to
listening stones . [???] cowered down with his hands pressed to his ears ;
but [???] [???] who had been looking out from the battlement as he spoke of
[???] [???] remained there [???] stiffened [???] staring out with starting eyes . [???]
knew the [???] cry that he had heard : it was the same that he had heard
long ago in the marish of the shire [???] but now it was grown in power and
hatred [???] piercing the heart with a poisonous despair .
at last [???] spoke with an effort . ' they have come ! ' he said . ' take
courage and look ! there are fell things below . '
[???] [???] climbed on to the seat and looked out over the wall .
the [???] lay dim beneath him [???] fading away to the scarce guessed line of
the great river . but now wheeling swiftly across it [???] like shadows of
untimely night [???] he saw in the middle airs below him five birdlike forms [???]
horrible as carrion - fowl yet greater than eagles [???] cruel as death . now they
[???] near [???] venturing almost within [???] of the walls [???] now they circled
away .
' black riders ! ' muttered [???] . ' black riders of the air ! but see [???]
[???] ! ' he cried . ' they are looking for something [???] surely ? see how they
wheel and swoop [???] always down to that point over there ! and can you see
something moving on the ground ? dark little things . yes [???] men on horses : four
or five . ah ! i cannot stand it ! [???] ! [???] save us ! '
another long screech rose and fell [???] and he threw himself back again
from the wall [???] panting like a hunted animal . faint and seemingly remote
through that [???] cry he heard winding up from below the sound of a
trumpet ending on a long high note .
' [???] ! the lord [???] ! it is his call ! ' cried [???] . ' brave
heart ! but how can he win to the gate [???] if these foul hell - hawks have other
weapons than fear ? but look ! they hold on . they will make the gate . no ! the

horses are running mad . look ! the men are thrown ; they are running on foot .
no [???] one is still up [???] but he rides back to the others . that will be the
captain : he can master both beasts and men . ah ! there one of the foul things
is stooping on him . help ! help ! will no one go out to him ? [???] ! '
with that [???] sprang away and ran off into the gloom . ashamed of
his terror [???] while [???] of the guard thought first of the captain whom he
loved [???] [???] got up and peered out . at that moment he caught a flash of
white and silver coming from the north [???] like a small star down on the [???]
fields . it moved with the speed of an arrow and grew as it came [???] [???]
swiftly with the flight of the four men towards the gate . it seemed to
[???] that a pale light was spread about it and the heavy shadows gave way
before it ; and then as it drew near he thought that he heard [???] like an echo
in the walls [???] a great voice calling .
' [???] ! ' he cried . ' [???] ! he always turns up when things are
darkest . go on ! go on [???] white rider ! [???] [???] [???] ! ' he shouted wildly [???]
like an [???] at a great race urging on a runner who is far beyond
encouragement .
but now the dark [???] shadows were aware of the [???] . one
wheeled towards him ; but it seemed to [???] that he raised his hand [???] and
from it a shaft of white light stabbed upwards . the [???] gave a long
wailing cry and [???] away ; and with that the four others wavered [???] and
then rising in swift spirals they passed away eastward vanishing into the
lowering cloud above ; and down on the [???] it seemed for a while less
dark .
[???] watched [???] and he saw the horseman and the white rider meet and
halt [???] waiting for those on foot . men now hurried out to them from the city ;
and soon they all passed from sight under the outer walls [???] and he knew that
they were entering the gate . guessing that they would come at once to the
tower and the steward [???] he hurried to the entrance of the [???] . there he
was joined by many others who had watched the race and the rescue from the
high walls .
it was not long before a clamour was heard in the streets leading up
from the outer circles [???] and there was much cheering and crying of the names
of [???] and [???] . presently [???] saw torches [???] and followed by a
press of people two horsemen riding slowly : one was in white but shining no
longer [???] pale in the [???] as if his fire was spent or veiled ; the other
was dark and his head was bowed . they [???] [???] and as grooms took

[???] and the other horse [???] they walked forward to the [???] at the
gate : [???] steadily [???] his grey cloak flung back [???] and a fire still
[???] in his eyes ; the other [???] clad all in green [???] slowly [???] swaying a
little as a weary or a wounded man .
[???] pressed forward as they passed under the lamp beneath the
gate - arch [???] and when he saw the pale face of [???] he caught his breath . it
was the face of one who has been assailed by a great fear or anguish [???] but
has mastered it and now is quiet . proud and grave he stood for a moment as
he spoke to the guard [???] and [???] gazing at him saw how closely he resembled
his brother [???] - whom [???] had liked from the first [???] admiring the
great man ' s lordly but kindly manner . yet suddenly for [???] his heart was
strangely moved with a feeling that he had not known before . here was one
with an air of high nobility such as [???] at times revealed [???] less high
perhaps [???] yet also less [???] and remote : one of the kings of men born
into a later time [???] but touched with the wisdom and sadness of the elder
race . he knew now why [???] spoke his name with love . he was a
captain
that men would follow [???] that he would follow [???] even under the shadow of the
black wings .
' [???] ! ' he cried aloud with the others . ' [???] ! ' and [???]
catching his strange voice among the clamour of the men of the city [???] turned
and looked down at him and was amazed .
' whence come you ? ' he said . ' a halfling [???] and in the livery of the
tower ! whence . . . ? '
but with that [???] stepped to his side and spoke . ' he came with me
from the land of the halflings [???] ' he said . ' he came with me . but let us not
tarry here . there is much to say and to do [???] and you are weary . he shall come
with us . indeed he must [???] for if he does not forget his new duties more
easily than i do [???] he must attend on his lord again within this hour . come [???]
[???] [???] follow us ! '
so at length they came to the private chamber of the lord of the city .
there deep seats were set about a [???] of [???] ; and wine was brought ;
and there [???] [???] hardly noticed [???] stood behind the chair of [???] and
felt his weariness little [???] so eagerly did he listen to all that was said .
when [???] had taken white bread and drunk a draught of wine [???] he sat
upon a low chair at his father ' s left hand . removed a little upon the other
side sat [???] in a chair of carven wood ; and he seemed at first to be

asleep . for at the beginning [???] spoke only of the errand upon which he
had been sent out ten days before [???] and he brought tidings of [???] and of
movements of the enemy and his allies ; and he told of the fight on the road
when the men of harad and their great beast were overthrown : a captain
reporting to his master such matters as had often been heard before [???] small
things of border - war that now seemed useless and petty [???] shorn of their
renown .
then suddenly [???] looked at [???] . ' but now we come to strange
matters [???] ' he said . ' for this is not the first halfling that i have seen
walking out of northern [???] into the [???] . '
at that [???] sat up and gripped the arms of his chair ; but he said
nothing [???] and with a look stopped the exclamation on [???] ' s lips . [???]
looked at their faces and nodded his head [???] as though in sign that he had
read much there before it was spoken . slowly [???] while the others sat silent
and still [???] [???] told his tale [???] with his eyes for the most part on
[???] [???] though now and again his glance strayed to [???] [???] as if to refresh
his memory of others that he had seen .
as his story was unfolded of his meeting with [???] and his servant and
of the events at [???] annyn [???] [???] became aware that [???] ' s hands
were trembling as they clutched the carven wood . white they seemed now
and
very old [???] and as he looked at them [???] suddenly with a thrill of fear [???]
knew that [???] [???] [???] himself [???] was troubled [???] even afraid . the air of
the room was close and still . at last when [???] spoke of his parting with
the travellers [???] and of their resolve to go to [???] ungol [???] his voice fell [???]
and he shook his head and sighed . then [???] sprang up .
' [???] ungol ? [???] vale ? ' he said . ' the time [???] [???] [???] the time ?
when did you part with them ? when would they reach that accursed valley ? '
' i parted with them in the morning two days ago [???] ' said [???] . ' it is
fifteen leagues thence to the vale of the [???] [???] if they went straight
south ; and then they would be still five [???] es westward of the accursed
tower . at swiftest they could not come there before today [???] and maybe they
have not come there yet . indeed i see what you fear . but the darkness is not
due to their venture . it began [???] [???] and all [???] was under sha dow
last night . it is clear to me that the enemy has long planned an assault on
us [???] and its hour had already been determined before ever the travellers left
my keeping . '

[???] paced the floor . ' the morning of two days ago [???] nigh on three
days of journey ! how far is the place where you parted ? '
' some twenty - five leagues as a bird flies [???] ' answered [???] . ' but i
could not come more swiftly . [???] i lay at cair andros [???] the long isle
in the river northward which we hold in defence ; and horses are kept on the
hither bank . as the dark drew on i knew that haste was needed [???] so i rode
thence with three others that could also be horsed . the rest of my company i
sent south to strengthen the [???] at the fords of [???] . i hope that
i have not done ill ? ' he looked at his father .
' ill ? ' cried [???] [???] and his eyes flashed suddenly . ' why do you ask ?
the men were under your command . or do you ask for my judgement on all
your
deeds ? your bearing is lowly in my presence [???] yet it is long now since you
turned from your own way at my counsel . see [???] you have spoken [???] [???] as
ever ; but i [???] have i not seen your eye fixed on [???] [???] seeking whether
you said well or too much ? he has long had your heart in his keeping .
' my son [???] your father is old but not yet dotard . i can see and hear [???] as
was my wont ; and little of what you have half said or left unsaid is now
hidden from me . i know the answer to many [???] . alas [???] alas for [???] ! '
' if what i have done displeases you [???] my father [???] ' said [???] quietly [???]
' i wish i had known your counsel before the burden of so weighty a judgement
was thrust on me . '
' would that have [???] to change your judgement ? ' said [???] . ' you
would still have done just so [???] i deem . i k now you well . ever your desire is
to appear lordly and generous as a king of old [???] gracious [???] gentle . that may
well befit one of high race [???] if he sits in power and peace . but in desperate
hours gentleness may be repaid with death . '
' so be it [???] ' said [???] .
' so be it ! ' cried [???] . ' but not with your death only [???] lord
[???] : with the death also of your father [???] and of all your people [???] whom it
is your part to protect now that [???] is gone . '
' do you wish then [???] ' said [???] [???] ' that our places had been exchanged ? '
' yes [???] i wish that indeed [???] ' said [???] . ' for [???] was loyal to me
and no [???] ' s pupil . he would have remembered his father ' s need [???] and would
not have [???] what fortune gave . he would have brought me a mighty
gift . '
for a moment [???] ' s restraint gave way . ' i would ask you [???] my father [???]

to remember why it was that i [???] not he [???] was in [???] . on one occasion at
least your counsel has prevailed [???] not long ago . it was the lord of the city
that gave the errand to him . '
' stir not the bitterness in the cup that i mixed for myself [???] ' said
[???] . ' have i not tasted it now many nights upon my tongue [???]
that worse yet lay in the dregs ? as now indeed i find . would it were not so !
would that this thing had come to me ! '
' comfort yourself ! ' said [???] . ' in no case would [???] have
brought it to you . he is dead [???] and died well ; may he sleep in peace ! yet you
deceive yourself . he would have stretched out his hand to this thing [???] and
taking it he would have fallen . he would have kept it for his own [???] and when
he returned you would not have known your son . '
the face of [???] set hard and cold . ' you found [???] less apt to
your hand [???] did you not ? ' he said softly . ' but i who was his father say that
he would have brought it to me . you are wise [???] maybe [???] [???] [???] yet with
all your subtleties you have not all wisdom . counsels may be found that are
neither the webs of [???] nor the haste of fools . i have in this matter
more lore and wisdom than you deem . '
' what then is your wisdom ? ' said [???] .
' enough to perceive that there are two follies to avoid . to use this
thing is perilous . at this hour [???] to send it in the hands of a witless
halfling into the land of the enemy himself [???] as you have done [???] and this son
of mine [???] that is madness . '
' and the lord [???] what would he have done ? '
' neither . but most surely not for any argument would he have set this
thing at a hazard beyond all bu t a fool ' s hope [???] risking our utter ruin [???] if
the enemy should recover what he lost . nay [???] it should have been kept [???]
hidden [???] hidden dark and deep . not used [???] i say [???] unless at the uttermost end
of need [???] but set beyond his grasp [???] save by a victory so final that what then
befell would not trouble us [???] being dead . '
' you think [???] as is your wont [???] my lord [???] of [???] only [???] ' said [???] .
' yet there are other men and other lives [???] and time still to be . and for me [???]
i pity even his slaves . '
' and wher e will other men look for help [???] if [???] falls ? ' answered
[???] . ' if i had this thing now in the deep vaults of this [???] [???] we
should not then shake with dread under this gloom [???] fearing the worst [???] and
our counsels would be [???] . if you do not trust me to endure the

test [???] you do not know me yet . '
' nonetheless i do not trust you [???] ' said [???] . ' had i done so [???] i could
have sent this thing hither to your keeping and spared myself and others
much anguish . and now hearing you speak i trust you less [???] no more than
[???] . nay [???] stay your wrath ! i do not trust myself in this [???] and i refused
this thing [???] even as a freely given gift . you are strong and can still in
some matters govern yourself [???] [???] ; yet if you had received this thing [???]
it would have overthrown you . were it buried beneath the roots of
[???] [???] still it would burn your mind away [???] as the darkness grows [???] and
the yet worse things follow that soon shall come upon us . '
for a moment the eyes of [???] glowed again as he faced [???] [???] and
[???] felt once more the strain between their wills ; but now almost it
seemed as if their glances were like blades from eye to eye [???] [???] as
they fenced . [???] trembled fearing some dreadful stroke . but suddenly
[???] [???] and grew cold again . he [???] his shoulders .
' if i had ! if you had ! ' he said . ' such words and ifs are vain . it has
gone into the shadow [???] and only time will show what doom [???] it and us .
the time will not be long . in what is left [???] let all who fight the enemy in
their fashion be at one [???] and keep hope while they may [???] and after hope still
the [???] to die free . ' he turned to [???] . ' what think you of the
[???] at [???] ? '
' it is not strong [???] ' said [???] . ' i have sent the company of [???]
to strengthen it [???] as i have said . '
' not enough [???] i deem [???] ' said [???] . ' it is there that the first blow
will fall . they will have need of some stout captain there . '
' there and elsewhere in many places [???] ' said [???] [???] and sighed . ' alas
for my brother [???] whom i too loved ! ' he rose . ' may i have your leave [???] father ? '
and then he swayed and leaned upon his father ' s chair .
' you are weary [???] i see [???] ' said [???] . ' you have ridden fast and far [???]
and under shadows of evil in the air [???] i am told . '
' let us not speak of that ! ' said [???] .
' then we will not [???] ' said [???] . ' go now and rest as you may .
tomorrow ' s need will be sterner . '
all now took leave of the lor d of the city and went to rest while they
still could . outside there was a starless blackness as [???] with [???]
beside him bearing a small torch [???] made his way to their lodging . they did
not speak until they were behind closed doors . then at last [???] took

[???] ' s hand .
' tell me [???] ' he said [???] ' is there any hope ? for [???] [???] i mean ; or at least
mostly for [???] . '
[???] put his hand on [???] ' s head . ' there never was much hope [???] ' he
answered . ' just a fool ' s hope [???] as i have been told . and when i heard of
[???] ungol - - - - - - ' he broke off and strode to the window as if his eyes
could pierce the night in the east . ' [???] ungol ! ' he muttered . ' why that
way [???] i wonder ? ' he turned . ' just now [???] [???] [???] my heart almost failed me [???]
hearing that name . and yet in truth i believe that the news that [???]
brings has some hope in it . for it seems clear that our enemy has opened his
war at last and made the first move while [???] was still free . so now for
many days he will have his eye turned this way and that [???] away from his own
land . and yet [???] [???] [???] i feel from afar his haste and fear . he has begun
sooner than he would . something has happened to stir him . '
[???] stood for a moment in thought . ' maybe [???] ' he muttered . ' maybe
even your foolishness helped [???] my lad . let me see : some five days ago now he
would discover that we had thrown down [???] and had taken the stone .
still what of that ? we could not use it to much purpose [???] or without his
knowing . ah ! i wonder . [???] ? his time draws near . and he is strong and
stern underneath [???] [???] ; bold [???] determined [???] able to take his own counsel and
dare great risks at need . that may be it . he may have used the stone and
shown himself to the enemy [???] challenging him [???] for this very purpose . i
wonder . well [???] we shall not know the answer till the riders of [???] come [???] if
they do not come too late . there are evil days ahead . to sleep while we
may ! '
' but [???] ' said [???] .
' but what ? ' said [???] . ' only one but will i allow tonight . '
' [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' how on earth could they be going about with
him [???] even following him ? and i could see that [???] did not like the place
he was taking them to any more than you do . what is wrong ? '
' i cannot answer that now [???] ' said [???] . ' yet my heart guessed that
[???] and [???] would meet before the end . for good [???] or for evil . but of
[???] ungol i will not speak tonight . treachery [???] treachery i fear ;
treachery of that miserable creature . but so it must be . let us remember
that a traitor may betray himself and do good that he does not intend . it
can be so [???] sometimes . good night ! '
the next day came with a morning like a brown [???] [???] and the hearts of

men [???] lifted for a while by the return of [???] [???] sank low again . the winged
shadows were not seen again that day [???] yet ever and anon [???] high above the
city [???] a faint cry would come [???] and many who heard it would stand [???]
with a passing dread [???] while the less stout - hearted [???] and wept .
and now [???] was gone again . ' they give him no rest [???] ' some murmured .
' the lord drives his son too hard [???] and now he must do the duty of two [???] for
himself and for the one that will not return . ' and ever men looked
northward [???] asking : ' where are the riders of [???] ? '
in truth [???] did not go by his own choosing . but the lord of the
city was master of his council [???] and he was in no mood that day to bow to
others . early in the morning the council had been summoned . there all the
captains judged that because of the threat in the south their force was too
weak to make any stroke of war on their own part [???] unless perchance the
riders of [???] yet should come . meanwhile they must man the walls and
wait .
' yet [???] ' said [???] [???] ' we should not lightly abandon the outer
defences [???] the rammas made with so great a labour . and the enemy must
pay
dearly for the crossing of the river . that he cannot do [???] in force to assail
the city [???] either north of cair andros because of the marshes [???] or southwards
towards [???] because of the breadth of the river [???] that needs many boats .
it is at [???] that he will put his weight [???] as before when [???]
denied him the passage . '
' that was but a trial [???] ' said [???] . ' today we may make the enemy pay
ten times our loss at the passage and yet rue the exchange . for he can
afford to lose a host better than we to lose a company . and the retreat of
those that we put out far afield will be per ilous [???] if he wins across in
force . '
' and what of cair andros ? ' said the prince . ' that [???] too [???] must be held [???]
if [???] is defended . let us not forget the danger on our left . the
[???] may come [???] and they may not . but [???] has told us of great
strength drawing ever to the black gate . more than one host may issue from
it [???] and strike for more than one passage . '
' much must be risked in war [???] ' said [???] . ' cair andros is manned and
no more can be sent so far . but i will not yield the river and the [???]
unfought - not if there is a captain here who has still the courage to do
his lord ' s will . '

then all were silent [???] but at length [???] said : ' i do not oppose your
will [???] sire . since you are robbed of [???] [???] i will go and do what i can in
his stead - if you command it . '
' i do so [???] ' said [???] .
' then farewell ! ' said [???] . ' but if i should return [???] think better of
me ! '
' that depends on the manner of your return [???] ' said [???] .
[???] it was that last spoke to [???] ere he rode east . ' do not
throw your live away rashly or in bitterness [???] ' he said . ' you will be needed
here [???] for other things than war . your father loves you [???] [???] [???] and will
remember it ere the end . farewell ! '
so now the lord [???] had gone forth again [???] and had taken with him
such strength of men as were willing to go or could be spared . on the walls
some gazed through the gloom towards the ruined city [???] and they wondered
what
chanced there [???] for nothing could be seen . and others [???] as ever [???] looked north
and counted the leagues to [???] in [???] . ' will he come ? will he
remember
our old alliance ? ' they said .
' yes [???] he will come [???] ' said [???] [???] ' even if he comes too late . but
think ! at best the red arrow cannot have reached him more than two days
ago [???]
and the miles are long from [???] . '
it was night again ere news came . a man rode in haste from the fords [???]
saying that a host had issued from minas [???] and was already drawing nigh
to [???] ; and it had been joined by regiments from the south [???] [???] [???]
cruel and tall . ' and we have learned ' said the messenger [???] ' that the black
captain leads them once again [???] and the fear of him has passed before him
over the river . '
with those ill - boding words the third day closed since [???] came to
minas [???] . few went to rest [???] for small hope had any now that even [???]
could hold the fords for long .
the next day [???] though the darkness had reached its full and grew no
deeper [???] it weighed heavier on men ' s hearts [???] and a great dread was on them .
ill news came soon again . the passage of [???] was won by the enemy .
[???] was retreating to the wall of the [???] [???] [???] his men to the
causeway forts ; but he was ten times [???] .

' if he wins back at all across the [???] [???] his enemies will be on his
heels [???] ' said the messenger . ' they have paid dear for the crossing but less
dearly than we hoped . the plan has been well laid . it is now seen that in
secret they have long been building floats and barges in great numbers in
east [???] . they swarmed across like beetles . but it is the black
captain that defeats us . few will stand and abide even the rumour of his
coming . his own folk quail at him [???] and they would slay themselves at his
bidding . '
' then i am needed there more than here [???] ' said [???] [???] and rode off at
once [???] and the glimmer of him faded soon from sight . and all that night
[???] alone and sleepless stood upon the wall and gazed eastward .
the bells of day had scarcely rung out again [???] a mockery in the
[???] dark [???] when far away he saw fires spring up [???] across in the dim
spaces where the walls of the [???] stood . the watchmen cried aloud [???] and
all men in the city stood to arms . now ever and anon there was a red flash [???]
and slowly through the heavy air dull rumbles could be heard .
' they have taken the wall ! ' men cried . ' they are blasting breaches in
it . they are coming ! '
' where is [???] ? ' cried [???] in dismay . ' say not that he has
fallen ! '
it was [???] that brought the first tidings . with a handful of
horsemen he came in the middle morning [???] riding as escort to a line of wains .
they were filled with wounded men [???] all that could be sa ved from the wreck of
the causeway forts . at once he went to [???] . the lord of the city sat
now in a high chamber above the hall of the white tower with [???] at his
side ; and through the dim windows [???] north and south and east [???] he bent his
dark eyes [???] as if to pierce the shadows of doom that ringed him round . most
to the north he looked [???] and would pause at whiles to listen as if by some
ancient art his ears might hear the thunder of [???] on the plains far away .
' is [???] come ? ' he a sked .
' no [???] ' said [???] . ' but he still lived when i left him . yet he is
resolved to stay with the [???] [???] lest the retreat over the [???]
become a rout . he may [???] perhaps [???] hold his men together long enough [???] but i
doubt it . he is pitted against a foe too great . for one has come that i
feared . '
' not - the dark lord ? ' cried [???] [???] forgetting his place in his
terror .

[???] laughed bitterly . ' nay [???] not yet [???] master [???] ! he will not
come save only to triumph over me when all is won . he uses others as his
weapons . so do all great lords [???] if they are wise [???] master halfling . or why
should i sit here in my tower and think [???] and watch [???] and wait [???] spending even
my sons ? for i can still wield a brand . '
he stood up and cast open his long black cloak [???] and behold ! he was clad
in mail beneath [???] and girt with a long sword [???] great - [???] in a sheath of
black and silver . ' thus have i walked [???] and thus now for many years have i
slept [???] ' he said [???] ' lest with age the body should grow soft and timid . '
' yet now under the lord of barad - dyr the most fell of all his captains
is already master of your outer walls [???] ' said [???] . ' king of [???] long
ago [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] lord of the [???] [???] a spear of terror in the hand
of [???] [???] shadow of despair . '
' then [???] [???] [???] you had a foe to match you [???] ' said [???] . ' for
myself [???] i have long known who is the chief captain of the hosts of the dark
tower . is this all that you have returned to say ? or can it be that you have
withdrawn because you are [???] ? '
[???] trembled [???] fearing that [???] would be stung to sudden wrath [???]
but his fear was needless . ' it might be so [???] ' [???] answered softly . ' but
our trial of strength is not yet come . and if words spoken of old be true [???]
not by the hand of man shall he fall [???] and hidden from the wise is the doom
that [???] him . however that may be [???] the captain of despair does not press
forward [???] yet . he rules rather according to the wisdom that you have just
spoken [???] from the rear [???] driving his slaves in madness on before .
' nay [???] i came rather to guard the hurt men that can yet be healed ; for
the rammas is breached far and wide [???] and soon the host of [???] will enter
in at many points . and i came chiefly to say this . soon there will be battle
on the fields . a sortie must be made ready . let it be of mounted men . in
them lies our brief hope [???] for in one thing only is the enemy still poorly
provided : he has few horsemen . '
' and we also have few . now would the coming of [???] be in the nick of
time [???] ' said [???] .
' we are likely to see other [???] first [???] ' said [???] . ' [???]
from cair andros have already reached us . the isle has fallen . another army
is come from the black gate [???] crossing from the north - east . '
' some have accused you [???] [???] [???] of delighting to bear ill news [???] '
said [???] [???] ' but to me this is no longer news : it was known to mw ere

nightfall yesterday . as for the sortie [???] i had already given thought to it .
let us go down . '
time passed . at length watchers on the walls could see the retreat of
the out - companies . small bands of weary and often wounded men came first
with little order ; some were running wildly as if pursued . away to the
ea stward the distant fires [???] ; and now it seemed that here and there
they crept across the plain . houses and barns were burning . then from many
points little rivers of red flame came hurrying on [???] winding through the
gloom [???] [???] towards the line of the broad road that led from the
city - gate to [???] .
' the enemy [???] ' men murmured . ' the dike is down . here they come pouring
through the breaches ! and they carry torches [???] it seems . where are our own
folk ? '
it drew now to evening by the hour [???] and the light was so dim that even
far - sighted men upon the [???] could discern little clearly out upon the
fields [???] save only the burnings that ever [???] [???] and the lines of fire
that grew in length and speed . at last [???] less than a mile from the city [???] a
more ordered mass of men came into view [???] marching not running [???] still holding
together .
the watchers held their breath . ' [???] must be there [???] ' they said . ' he
can govern man and beast . he will make it yet . '
now the main retreat was scarcely two [???] distant . out of the
gloom behind a small company of horsemen [???] [???] all that was left of the
[???] . once again they turned at bay [???] facing the [???] lines of fire .
then suddenly there was a tumult of fierce cries . horsemen of the enemy
swept up . the lines of fire became flowing [???] [???] file upon file of [???]
bearing flames [???] and wild southron men with red banners [???] shouting with harsh
tongues [???] surging up [???] overtaking the retreat . and with a piercing cry out of
the dim sky fell the winged shadows [???] the [???] stooping to the kill .
the retreat became a rout . already men were breaking away [???] flying wild
and witless here and there [???] flinging away their weapons [???] crying out in fear [???]
falling to the ground .
and then a trumpet rang from the [???] [???] and [???] at last released
the sortie . drawn up within the shadow of the gate and under the looming
walls outside they had waited for his signal : all the mounted men that were
left in the city . now they sprang forward [???] formed [???] quickened to a gallop [???]
and charged with a great shout . and from the walls an answering shout went

up ; for foremost on the field rode the swan - knights of dol amroth with their
prince and his blue banner at their head .
' amroth for [???] ! ' they cried . ' amroth to [???] ! '
like thunder they broke upon the enemy on either flank of the retreat ;
but one rider outran them all [???] swift as the wind in the grass : [???]
bore him [???] shining [???] [???] once more [???] a light starting from his [???]
hand .
the [???] [???] and swept away [???] for their captain was not yet come
to challenge the white fire of his foe . the hosts of [???] intent on their
prey [???] taken at [???] in wild career [???] broke [???] scattering like sparks in a
gale . the out - companies with a great cheer turned and smote their pursuers .
hunters became the hunted . the retreat became an [???] . the field was
strewn with [???] [???] and men [???] and a reek arose of torches cast away [???]
[???] ou t in [???] smoke . the [???] rode on .
but [???] did not permit them to go far . though the enemy was
checked [???] and for the moment driven back [???] great forces were flowing in from
the east . again the trumpet rang [???] sounding the retreat . the [???] of
[???] halted . behind their screen the out - companies re - formed . now steadily
they came marching back . they reached the gate of the city and entered [???]
stepping proudly : and proudly the people of the city looked on them and
cried their praise [???] and yet they were troubled in heart . for the companies
were grievously reduced . [???] had lost a third of his men . and where was
he ?
last of all he came . his men passed in . the mounted knights returned [???]
and at their rear the banner of dol amroth [???] and the prince . and in his arms
before him on his horse he bore the body of his kinsman [???] [???] son of
[???] [???] found upon the [???] field .
' [???] ! [???] ! ' men cried [???] weeping in the streets . but he did not
answer [???] and they bore him away up the winding road to the [???] and his
father . even as the [???] had [???] aside from the onset of the white
rider [???] there came flying a deadly dart [???] and [???] [???] as he held at bay a
mounted champion of harad [???] had fallen to the earth . only the charge of dol
amroth had saved him from the red southland swords that would have hewed
him
as he lay .
the prince [???] brought [???] to the white tower [???] and he said :
your son has returned [???] lord [???] after great deeds [???] and he told all that he had

seen . but [???] rose and looked on the face of his son and was silent .
then he bade them make a bed in the chamber and lay [???] upon it and
depart . but he himself went up alone into the secret room under the summit
of the tower ; and many who looked up thither at that time saw a pale light
that gleamed and [???] from the narrow windows for a while [???] and then
flashed and went out . and when [???] descended again he went to
[???]
and sat beside him withou t speaking [???] but the face of the lord was grey [???] more
deathlike than his son ' s .
so now at last the city was [???] [???] enclosed in a ring of foes . the
rammas was broken [???] and all the [???] abandoned to the enemy . the last
word to come from outside the walls was brought by men flying down the
northward road ere the gate was shut . they were the [???] of the guard
that was kept at that point where the way from [???] and [???] ran into
the [???] : ingold led them [???] the same who had admitted [???] and [???]
less than five days before [???] while the sun still rose and there was hope in
the morning .
' there is no news of the [???] [???] ' he said . ' [???] will not come now .
or if they come [???] it will not avail us . the new host that we had tidings of
has come first [???] from over the river by way of andros [???] it is said . they are
strong : [???] of [???] of the eye [???] and countless companies of men of a
new sort that we have not met before . not tall [???] but broad and grim [???] bearded
like [???] [???] [???] great axes . out of some savage land in the wide east
they come [???] we deem . they hold the northward road ; and many have passed
on
into [???] . the [???] cannot come . '
the gate was shut . all night watchmen on the walls heard the rumour of
the enemy that roamed outside [???] burning field and tree [???] and hewing any man
that they found abroad [???] living or dead . the numbers that had already passed
over the river could not be guessed in the darkness [???] but when morning [???] or
its dim shadow [???] stole over the plain [???] it was seen that even fear by night
had scarcely over - counted them . the plain was dark with their marching
companies [???] and as far as eyes could strain in the mirk there [???] [???] like
a foul [???] - growth [???] all about the [???] city great camps of tents [???]
black or [???] red .
busy as ants hurrying [???] were digging [???] digging lines of deep trenches
in a huge ring [???] just out of [???] from the walls ; and as the trenches were

made each was filled with fire [???] though how it was kindled or fed [???] by art or
devilry [???] none could see . all day the labour went forward [???] while the men of
minas [???] looked on [???] unable to hinder it . and as each length of trench
was completed [???] they could see great wains approaching ; and soon yet more
companies of the enemy were swiftly setting up [???] each behind the cover of a
trench [???] great engines for the casting of missiles . there were none upon the
city walls large enough to reach so far or to stay the work .
at first men laughed and did not greatly fear such devices . for the
main wall of the city was of great height and marvellous thickness [???] built
ere the power and craft of n [???] menor waned in exile ; and its outward face was
like to the tower of orthanc [???] hard and dark and smooth [???] [???] by
steel or fire [???] [???] except by some convulsion that would rend the
very earth on which it stood .
' nay [???] ' they said [???] ' not if the nameless one himself should come [???] not
even he could enter here while we yet live . ' but some answered : ' while we
yet live ? how long ? he has a weapon that has brought low many strong places
since the world began . hunger . the roads are cut . [???] will not come . '
but the engines did not waste shot upon the [???] wall . it was no
[???] or orc - chieftain that ordered the assault upon the lord of [???] ' s
greatest foe . a power and mind of malice guided it . as soon as the great
[???] were set [???] with many yells and the creaking of rope and winch [???] they
began to throw missiles marvellou sly high [???] so that they passed right above
the battlement and fell [???] within the first circle of the city ; and
many of them by some secret art burst into flame as they came [???] down .
soon there was great peril of fire behind the wall [???] and all who could
be spared were busy quelling the flames that sprang up in many places . then
among the greater casts there fell another hail [???] less ruinous but more
horrible . all about the streets and lanes behind the gate it tumbled down [???]
small round shot that did not burn . but when men ran to learn what it might
be [???] they cried aloud or wept . for the enemy was flinging into the city all
the heads of those who had fallen fighting at [???] [???] or on the rammas [???]
or in the fields . they were grim to look on ; for though some were crushed
and shapeless [???] and some had been cruelly hewn [???] yet many had features that
could be told [???] and it seemed that they had died in pain ; and all were
branded with the foul token of the [???] eye . but marred and dishonoured
as they were [???] it often chanced that thus a man would see again the face of
someone that he had known [???] who had walked proudly once in arms [???] or tilled

the fields [???] or ridden in upon a holiday from the green vales in the hills .
in vain men shook their fists at the pitiless foes that swarmed before
the gate . curses they heeded not [???] nor understood the tongues of western men ;
crying with harsh voices like beasts and carrion - birds . but soon there were
few left in minas [???] who had the heart to stand up and defy the hosts of
[???] . for yet another weapon [???] swifter than hunger [???] the lord of the dark
tower had : dread and despair .
the [???] came again [???] and as their dark lord now grew and put forth
his strength [???] so their voices [???] which uttered only his will and his malice [???]
were filled with evil and horror . ever they circled above the city [???] like
[???] that expect their fill of doomed men ' s flesh . out of sight and shot
they flew [???] and yet were ever present [???] and their deadly voices rent the air .
more [???] they became [???] not less [???] at each new cry . at length even the
stout - hearted would fling themselves to the ground as the hidden menace
passed over them [???] or they would stand [???] letting their weapons fall from
[???] hands while into their minds a blackness came [???] and they thought no
more of war [???] but only of hiding and of [???] [???] and of death .
during all this black day [???] lay upon his bed in the chamber of
the white tower [???] wandering in a desperate fever ; dying someone said [???] and
soon ' dying ' all men were saying upon the walls and in the streets . and by
him his father sat [???] and said nothing [???] but watched [???] and gave no longer any
heed to the defence .
no hours so dark had [???] known [???] not even in the clutches of the
[???] - hai . it was his duty to wait upon the lord [???] and wait he did [???] forgotten
it seemed [???] standing by the door of the unlit chamber [???] mastering his own
fears as best he could . and as he watched [???] it seemed to him that [???]
grew old before his eyes [???] as if something had snapped in his proud will [???] and
his stern mind was overthrown . grief maybe had wrought it [???] and remorse . he
saw tears on that once tearless face [???] more [???] than wrath .
' do not weep [???] lord [???] ' he [???] . ' perhaps he will get well . have you
asked [???] ? '
' comfort me not with [???] ! ' said [???] . ' the fool ' s hope has
failed . the enemy has found it [???] and now his power waxes ; he sees our very
thoughts [???] and all we do is ruinous .
' i sent my son forth [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] out into needless peril [???]
and here he lies with poison in his veins . nay [???] nay [???] whatever may now betide
in war [???] my line too is ending [???] even the house of the stewards has failed .

mean folk shall rule the last [???] of the kings of men [???] lurking in the
hills until all are hounded out . '
men came to the door crying for the lord of the city . ' nay [???] i will not
come down [???] ' he said . ' i must stay beside my son . he might still speak before
the end . but that is near . follow whom you will [???] even the grey fool [???] though
his hope has failed . here i stay . '
so it was that [???] took command of the last defence of the city of
[???] . wherever he came men ' s hearts would lift again [???] and the winged
shadows pass from memory . [???] he strode from [???] to gate [???] from
north to south about the wall ; and with him went the prince of dol amroth in
his shining mail . for he and his knights still held themselves like lords in
whom the race of n [???] menor ran true . men that saw them whispered saying :
' belike the old tales speak well ; there is elvish blood in the veins of that
folk [???] for the people of [???] dwelt in that land once long ago . ' and then
one would sing amid the gloom some staves of the lay of [???] [???] or other
songs of the vale of [???] out of vanished years .
and yet - when they had gone [???] the shadows closed on men again [???] and
their hearts went cold [???] and the valour of [???] withered into ash . and so
slowly they passed out of a dim day of fears into the darkness of a
desperate night . fires now raged [???] in the first circle of the city [???]
and the [???] upon the outer wall was already in many places cut off from
retreat . but the faithful who remained there at their posts were few ; most
had fled beyond the second gate .
far behind the battle the river had been swiftly bridged [???] and all day
more force and gear of war had poured across . now at last in the middle
night the assault was loosed . the [???] passed through the trenches of
fire by many devious paths that had been left between them . on they came [???]
reckless of their loss as they approached [???] still [???] and herded [???] within
the range of bowmen on the wall . but indeed there were too few now left
there to do them great damage [???] though the light of the fires showed up many
a mark for archers of such skill as [???] once had boasted . then perceiving
that the valour of the city was already beaten down [???] the hidden captain put
forth his strength . slowly the great siege - towers built in [???] rolled
forward through the dark .
messengers came again to the chamber in the white tower [???] and [???] let
them enter [???] for they were urgent . [???] turned his head slowly from
[???] ' s face [???] and looked at them silently .

' the first circle of the city is burning [???] lord [???] ' they said . ' what are
your commands ? you are still the lord and steward . not all will follow
[???] . men are flying from the walls and leaving them unmanned . '
' why ? why do the fools fly ? ' said [???] . ' better to burn sooner than
late [???] for burn we must . go back to your [???] ! and i ? i will go now to my
pyre . to my pyre ! no tomb for [???] and [???] . no tomb ! no long
slow
sleep of death [???] . we wil l burn like heathen kings before ever a ship
sailed hither from the west . the west has failed . go back and burn ! '
the messengers without bow or answer turned and fled .
now [???] stood up and released the fevered hand of [???] that he
had held . ' he is burning [???] already burning [???] ' he said sadly . ' the house of his
spirit [???] . ' then stepping softly towards [???] he looked down at him .
' farewell ! ' he said . ' farewell [???] [???] son of [???] ! your service
has been short [???] and now it is drawing to an end . i release you from the
little that remains . go now [???] and die in what way seems best to you . and with
whom you will [???] even that friend whose folly brought you to this death . send
for my servants and then go . farewell ! '
' i will not say farewell [???] my lord [???] ' said [???] kneeling . and then
suddenly hobbit - like once more [???] he stood up and looked the old man in the
eyes . ' i will take your leave [???] sir [???] ' he said ; ' for i want to see [???]
very much indeed . but he is no fool ; and i will not think of dying until he
despairs of life . but from my word and your service i do not wish to be
released while you live . and if they come at last to the [???] [???] i hope to
be here and stand beside you and earn perhaps the arms that you have given
me . '
' do as you will [???] master halfling [???] ' said [???] . ' but my life is
broken . send for my servants ! ' he turned back to [???] .
[???] left him and called for the servants [???] and they came : six men of
the household [???] strong and fair ; yet they trembled at the summons . but in a
quiet voice [???] bade them lay warm coverlets on [???] ' s bed and take
it up . and they did so [???] and lifting up the bed they bore it from the
chamber . slowly they paced to trouble the fevered man as little as might be [???]
and [???] [???] now bending on a staff [???] followed them ; and last came [???] .
out from the white tower they walked [???] as if to a funeral [???] out into the
darkness [???] where the [???] cloud was lit beneath with [???] of dull
red . softly they paced the great courtyard [???] and at a word from [???]

halted beside the withered tree .
all was silent [???] save for the rumour of war in the city down below [???] and
they heard the water dripping sadly from the dead branches into the dark
pool . then they went on through the [???] gate [???] where the [???] stared
at them in wonder and dismay as they passed by . turning westward they came
at length to a door in the rearward wall of the sixth circle . fen hollen it
was called [???] for it was kept ever shut save at times of funeral [???] and only the
lord of the city might use that way [???] or those who bore the token of the
tombs and tended the houses of the dead . beyond it went a winding road that
descended in many curves down to the narrow land under the shadow of
[???] ' s [???] where stood the mansions of the dead kings and of
their stewards .
a porter sat in a little house beside the way [???] and with fear in his
eyes he came forth bearing a lantern in his hand . at the lord ' s command he
unlocked the door [???] and silently it swung back ; and they passed through [???]
taking the lantern from his hand . it was dark on the climbing road between
ancient walls and many - pillared [???] looming in the swaying
lantern - beam . their slow feet echoed as they walked down [???] down [???] until at
last they came to the silent street [???] rath [???] [???] between pale domes and
empty halls and images of men long dead ; and they entered into the house of
the stewards and set down their burden .
there [???] [???] staring [???] about him [???] saw that he was in a wide
vaulted chamber [???] draped as it were with the great shadows that the little
lantern threw upon its shrouded walls . and dimly to be seen were many rows
of tables [???] carved of marble ; and upon each table lay a sleeping form [???] hands
folded [???] head pillowed upon stone . but one table near at hand stood broad and
bare . upon it at a sign from [???] they laid [???] and his father side
by side [???] and covered them with one covering [???] and stood then with bowed heads
as mourners beside a bed of death . then [???] spoke in a low voice .
' here we will wait [???] ' he said . ' but send not for the [???] . bring us
wood quick to burn [???] and lay it all about us [???] and beneath ; and pour oil upon
it . and when i bid you thrust in a torch . do this and speak no more to me .
farewell ! '
' by your leave [???] lord ! ' said [???] and turned and fled in terror from
the deathly house . ' poor [???] ! ' he thought . ' i must find [???] . poor
[???] ! quite likely he needs medicine more than tears . oh [???] where can i
find [???] ? in the thick of things [???] i suppose ; and he will have no time to

spare for dying men or madmen . '
at the door he turned to one of the servants who had remained on guard
there . ' your master is not himself [???] ' he said . ' go slow ! bring no fire to
this place while [???] lives ! do nothing until [???] comes ! '
' who is the master of minas [???] ? ' the man answered . ' the lord
[???] or the grey wanderer ? '
' the grey wanderer or no one [???] it would seem [???] ' said [???] [???] and he sped
back and up the winding way as swiftly as his feet would carry him [???] past the
astonished porter [???] out through the door [???] and on [???] till he came near the gate
of the [???] . the [???] hailed him as he went by [???] and he recognized the
voice of [???] .
' whither do you run [???] master [???] ? ' he cried .
' to find [???] [???] ' [???] answered .
' the lord ' s errands are urgent and should not be hindered by me [???] ' said
[???] ; ' but tell me quickly [???] if you may : what goes forward ? whither has
my lord gone ? i have just come on duty [???] but i heard that he passed towards
the closed door [???] and men were bearing [???] before him . '
' yes [???] ' said [???] [???] ' to the silent street . '
[???] bowed his head to hide his tears . ' they said that he was
dying [???] ' he sighed [???] ' and now he is dead . '
' no [???] ' said [???] [???] ' not yet . and even now his death might be prevented [???]
i think . but the lord of the city [???] [???] [???] has fallen before his city is
taken . he is fey and dangerous . ' quickly he told of [???] ' s strange words
and deeds . ' i must find [???] at once . '
' then you must go down to the battle . '
' i know . the lord has given me leave . but [???] [???] [???] if you can [???] do
someth ing to stop any dreadful thing happening . '
' the lord does not permit those who wear the black and silver to leave
their post for any cause [???] save at his own command . '
' well [???] you must choose between orders and the life of [???] [???] ' said
[???] . ' and as for orders [???] i think you have a madman to deal with [???] not a
lord . i must run . i will return if i can . '
he ran on [???] down [???] down towards the outer city . men flying back from the
burning passed him [???] and some seeing his livery turned and shouted [???] but he
paid no heed . at last he was through the second gate [???] beyond which great
fires leaped up between the walls . yet it seemed strangely silent . no noise
or shouts of battle or din of arms could be heard . then suddenly there was a

dreadful cry a nd a great shock [???] and a deep echoing boom . forcing himself on
against a gust of fear and horror that shook him almost to his knees . [???]
turned a corner opening on the wide place behind the city gate . he stopped
dead . he had found [???] ; but he shrank back [???] cowering into a shadow .
ever since the middle night the great assault had gone on . the drums
rolled . to the north and to the south company upon company of the enemy
pressed to the walls . there came great beasts [???] like moving houses in the red
and fitful light [???] the [???] of the harad dragging through the lanes amid
the fires huge towers and engines . yet their captain cared not greatly what
they did or how many might be slain : their purpose was only to test the
strength of the defence and to keep the men of [???] busy in many places .
it was against the gate that he would throw his heaviest weight . very strong
it might be [???] wrought of steel and iron [???] and guarded with towers and bastions
of [???] stone [???] yet it was the key [???] the weakest point in all that high
and [???] wall .
the drums rolled louder . fires leaped up . great engines [???] across
the field ; and in the midst was a huge ram [???] great as a forest - tree a hundred
feet in length [???] swinging on mighty chains . long had it been forging in the
dark smithies of [???] [???] and its hideous head [???] founded of black steel [???] was
shaped in the likeness of a ravening wolf ; on it spells of ruin lay . grond
they named it [???] in memory of the hammer of the [???] of old . great
beasts drew it [???] [???] surrounded it [???] and behind walked mountain - [???] to
wield it .
but about the gate resistance still was stout [???] and there the knights of
dol amroth and the hardiest of the [???] stood at bay . shot and dart fell
thick ; siege - towers [???] or blazed suddenly like torches . all before the
walls on either side of the gate the ground was choked with wreck and with
bodies of the slain ; yet still driven as by a madness more and more came up .
grond [???] on . upon its [???] no fire would catch ; and though now
and again some great beast that hauled it would go mad and spread stamping
ruin among the [???] [???] that guarded it [???] their bodies were cast
aside from its path and others took their place .
grond [???] on . the drums rolled wildly . over the hills of slain a
hideous shape appeared : a horseman [???] tall [???] hooded [???] cloaked in black . slowly [???]
trampling the fallen [???] he rode forth [???] heeding no longer any dart . he halted
and held up a long pale sword . and as he did so a great fear fell on all [???]
defender and foe alike ; and the hands of men drooped to their sides [???] and no

bow sang . for a moment all was still .
the drums rolled and rattled . with a vast rush grond was hurled forward
by huge hands . it reached the gate . it swung . a deep boom rumbled through
the city like thunder running in the clouds . but the doors of iron and posts
of steel [???] the stroke .
then the black captain rose in his [???] and cried aloud in a
dreadful voice [???] speaking in some forgotten tongue words of power and terror
to rend both heart and stone .
thrice he cried . thrice the great ram boomed . and suddenly upon the
last stroke the gate of [???] broke . as if [???] by some blasting spell
it burst asunder : there was a flash of searing lightning [???] and the doors
tumbled in riven fragments to the ground .
in rode the lord of the [???] . a great black shape against the fires
beyond he loomed up [???] grown to a vast menace of despair . in rode the lord of
the [???] [???] under the archway that no enemy ever yet had passed [???] and all
fled before his face .
all save one . there waiting [???] silent and still in the space before the
gate [???] sat [???] upon [???] : [???] who alone among the free
horses
of the earth endured the terror [???] [???] [???] steadfast as a graven image in
rath [???] .
' you cannot enter here [???] ' said [???] [???] and the huge shadow halted . ' go
back to the [???] prepared for you ! go back ! fall into the nothingness that
[???] you and your master . go ! '
the black rider flung back his hood [???] and behold ! he had a kingly crown ;
and yet upon no head visible was it set . the red fires shone between it and
the mantled shoulders vast and dark . from a mouth unseen there came a deadly
laughter .
' old fool ! ' he said . ' old fool ! this is my hour . do you not know death
when you see it ? die now and curse in vain ! ' and with that he lifted high
his sword and flames ran down the blade .
[???] did not move . and in that very moment [???] away behind in some
courtyard of the city [???] a cock crowed . shrill and clear he crowed [???] recking
nothing of [???] or war [???] welcoming only the morning that in the sky far
above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn .
and as if in answer there came from far away another note . horns [???]
horns [???] horns . in dark [???] ' s sides they dimly echoed . great horns of

the north wildly blowing . [???] had come at last .




chapter 5 . the ride of the [???]



it was dark and merry could see nothing as he lay on the ground rolled
in a blanket ; yet though the night was airless and windless [???] all about him
hidden trees were sighing softly . he lifted his head . then he heard it
again : a sound like faint drums in the wooded hills and mountain - steps . the
throb would cease suddenly and then be taken up again at some other point [???]
now nearer [???] now further off . he wondered if the watchmen had heard it .
he could not see them [???] but he knew that all round him were the
companies of the [???] . he could smell the horses in the dark [???] and could
hear their shiftings and their soft stamping on the needle - covered ground .
the host was [???] in the pine - woods that [???] about [???]
beacon [???] a tall hill standing up from the long ridges of the dr [???] adan forest
that lay beside the great road in east [???] .
tired as he was merry could not sleep . he had ridden now for four days
on end [???] and the ever - deepening gloom had slowly weighed down his heart . he
began to wonder why he had been so eager to come [???] when he had been given
every excuse [???] even his lord ' s command [???] to stay behind . he wondered [???] too [???] if
the old king knew that he had been [???] and was angry . perhaps not .
there seemed to be some understanding between [???] and [???] [???]
the
marshal who commanded the jored in which they were riding . he and all his
men ignored merry and pretended not to hear if he spoke . he might have been
just another bag that [???] was carrying . [???] was no comfort : he
never spoke to anyone . merry felt small [???] [???] [???] and lonely . now the time
was anxious [???] and the host was in peril . they were less than a day ' s ride
from the out - walls of minas [???] that [???] the [???] . scouts had
been sent ahead . some had not returned . others hastening back had reported
that the road was held in force against them . a host of the enemy was
[???] upon it [???] three miles west of amon don [???] and some strength of men
was
already thrusting along the road and was no more than three leagues away .
[???] were roving in the hills and woods along the roadside . the king and
jomer held council in the watches of the night .
merry wanted somebody to talk to [???] and he thought of [???] . but that

only increased his restlessness . poor [???] [???] shut up in the great city of
stone [???] lonely and afraid . merry wished he was a tall rider like jomer and
could blow a horn or something and go [???] to his rescue . he sat up [???]
listening to the drums that were beating again [???] now nearer at hand .
presently he heard voices speaking low [???] and he saw dim half - shrouded
lanterns passing through the trees . men nearby began to move uncertainly in
the dark .
a tall figure loomed up and [???] over him [???] cu rsing the tree - roots .
he recognized the voice of the marshal [???] [???] .
' i am not a tree - root [???] sir [???] ' he said [???] ' nor a bag [???] but a bruised hobbit .
the least you can do in amends is to tell me what is afoot . '
' anything that can keep so in this devi l ' s mirk [???] ' answered [???] .
' but my lord sends word that we must set ourselves in readiness : orders may
come for a sudden move . '
' is the enemy coming then ? ' asked merry anxiously . ' are those their
drums ? i began to think i was imagining them [???] as no one else seemed to take
any notice of them . '
' nay [???] nay [???] ' said [???] [???] ' the enemy is on the road not in the hills .
you hear the woses [???] the wild men of the woods : thus they talk together from
afar . they still haunt dr [???] adan forest [???] it is said . [???] of an older time
they be [???] living few and secretly [???] wild and wary as the beasts . they go not
to war with [???] or the mark ; but now they are troubled by the darkness
and the coming of the [???] : they fear lest the dark years be returning [???] as
seems likely enough . let us be thankful that they are not hunting us : for
they use poisoned arrows [???] it is said [???] and they are [???] beyond
compare . but they have offered their services to [???] . even now one of
their headmen is being taken to the king . yonder go the lights . so much i
have heard but no more . and now i must busy myself with my lord ' s
commands .
pack yourself up [???] master bag ! ' he vanished into the shadows .
merry did not like this talk of wild men and poisoned darts [???] but quite
apart from that a great weight of dread was on him . waiting was [???] .
he longed to know what was going to happen . he got up and soon was
walking
warily in pursuit of the last lantern before it disappeared among the trees .
presently he came to an open space where a small tent had been set up
for the king under a great tree . a large lantern [???] covered above [???] was hanging

from a bough and cast a pale circle of light below . there sat [???] and
jomer [???] and before them on the ground sat a strange squat shape of a man [???]
[???] as an old stone [???] and the hairs of his scanty beard [???] on his
lumpy chin like dry moss . he was short - legged and fat - armed [???] thick and
[???] [???] and clad only with grass about his waist . merry felt that he had
seen him before somewhere [???] and suddenly he remembered the p [???] kel - men
of
[???] . here was one of those old images brought to life [???] or maybe a
creature descended in true line through endless years from the models used
by the forgotten [???] long ago .
there was a silence as merry crept nearer [???] and then the wild man began
to speak [???] in answer to some question [???] it seemed . his voice was deep and
[???] [???] yet to merry ' s surprise he spoke the common speech [???] though in a
halting fashion [???] and uncouth words were mingled with it .
' no [???] father of horse - men [???] ' he said [???] ' we fight not . hunt only . kill
[???] in woods [???] hate orc - folk . you hate [???] too . we help as we can . wild
men have long ears and long eyes ; know all paths . wild men live here before
stone - houses ; before tall men come up out of water . '
' but our need is for aid in battle [???] ' said jomer . ' how will you and your
folk help us ? '
' bring news [???] ' said the wild man . ' we look out from hills . we climb big
mountain and look down . stone - city is shut . fire burns there outside ; now
inside too . you wish to come there ? then you must be quick . but [???] and
men out of far - away [???] ' he waved a short [???] arm eastward [???] ' sit on
horse - road . very many [???] mor e than horse - men . '
' how do you know that ? ' said jomer .
the old man ' s flat face and dark eyes showed nothing [???] but his voice was
sullen with displeasure . ' wild men are wild [???] free [???] but not children [???] ' he
answered . ' i am great headman [???] [???] - buri - [???] . i count many things : stars in
sky [???] leaves on trees [???] men in the dark . you have a score of scores counted
ten times and five . they have more . big fight [???] and who will win ? and many
more walk round walls of stone - houses . '
' alas ! he speaks all too shrewdly [???] ' said [???] . ' and our scouts say
that they have cast trenches and stakes across the road . we cannot sweep
them away in sudden onset . '
' and yet we need great haste [???] ' said jomer . ' [???] is on fire ! '
' let [???] - buri - [???] finish ! ' said the wild man . ' more than one road he

knows . he will lead you by road where no pits are [???] no [???] walk [???] only wild
men and beasts . many paths were made when stonehouse - folk were
stronger .
they carved hills as hunters carve beast - flesh . wild men think they ate
stone for food . they went through dr [???] adan to [???] with great wains .
they
go no longer . road is forgotten [???] but not by wild men . over hill and behind
hill it lies still under grass and tree [???] there behind [???] and down to
don [???] and back at the end to horse - men ' s road . wild men will show you that
road . then you will kill [???] and drive away bad dark with bright iron [???]
and wild men can go back to sleep in the wild woods . '
jomer and the king spoke together in their own tongue . at length
[???] turned to the wild man . ' we will receive your offer [???] ' he said . ' for
though we leave a host of foes behind [???] what matter ? if the stone - city falls [???]
then we shall have no returning . if it is saved [???] then the orc - host itself
will be cut off . if you are faithful [???] [???] - buri - [???] [???] then we will give you
rich reward [???] and you shall have the friendship of the mark for ever . '
' dead men are not friends to living men [???] and give them no gifts [???] ' said
the wild man . ' but if you live after the darkness [???] then leave wild men alone
in the woods and do not hunt them like beasts any more . [???] - buri - [???] will
not lead you into trap . he will go himself with father of horse - men [???] and if
he leads you wrong [???] you will kill him . '
' so be it ! ' said [???] .
' how long will it take to pass by the enemy and come back to the road ? '
asked jomer . ' we must go at foot - pace [???] if you guide us ; and i doubt not the
way is narrow . '
' wild men go quick on feet [???] ' said [???] . ' way is wide for four horses in
[???] valley yonder [???] ' he waved his hand southwards ; ' but narrow at
beginning and at end . wild man could walk from here to don between [???]
and noon . '
' then we must allow at least seven hours for the leaders [???] ' said jomer ;
' but we must reckon rather on some ten hours for all . things [???] may
hinder us [???] and if our host is all strung out [???] it will be long ere it can be
set in order when we issue from the hills . what is the hour now ? '
' who knows ? ' said [???] . ' all is night now . '
' it is all dark [???] but it is not all night . ' said [???] . ' when sun comes
we feel her [???] even when she is hidden . already she climbs over

east - mountains . it is the opening of day in the sky - fields . '
' then we must set out as soon as may be [???] ' said jomer . ' even so we
cannot hope to come to [???] ' s aid today . '
merry waited to hear no more [???] but slipped away to get ready for the
summons to the march . this was the last stage before the battle . it did not
seem likely to him that many of them would survive it . but he thought of
[???] and the flames in minas [???] and thrust down his own dread .
all went well that day [???] and no sight or sound had they of the enemy
waiting to waylay them . the wild men had put out a screen of wary hunters [???]
so that no orc or roving spy should learn of the movements in the hills . the
light was more dim than ever as they drew nearer to the [???] city [???]
and the riders passed in long files like dark shadows of men and hor ses .
each company was guided by a wild woodman ; but old [???] walked beside
the
king . the start had been slower than was hoped [???] for it had taken time for
the riders [???] walking and leading their horses [???] to find paths over the thickly
wooded ridges behind their camp and down into the hidden [???] valley .
it was late in the afternoon when the leaders came to wide grey thickets
stretching beyond the eastward side of amon don [???] and masking a great gap in
the line of hills that from [???] to don ran east and west . through the gap
the forgotten wain - road long ago had run down [???] back into the main horse - way
from the city through [???] ; but now for many lives of men trees had had
their way with it [???] and it had vanished [???] broken and buried under the leaves
of [???] years . but the thickets offered to the riders their last hope
of cover before they went into open battle ; for beyond them lay the road and
the plains of [???] [???] while east and southwards the [???] were bare and
rocky [???] as the [???] hills gathered themselves together and climbed up [???]
bastion upon bastion [???] into the great mass and shoulders of [???] .
the leading company was halted [???] and as those behind filed up out of the
trough of the [???] valley they spread out a nd passed to camping - places
under the grey trees . the king summoned the captains to council . jomer sent
out scouts to spy upon the road ; but old [???] shook his head .
' no good to send horse - men [???] ' he said . ' wild men have already seen all
that can be seen in the bad air . they will come soon and speak to me here . '
the captains came ; and then out of the trees crept warily other
p [???] kel - shapes so like old [???] that merry could hardly tell them apart . they
spoke to [???] in a strange throaty language .

presently [???] turned to the king . ' wild men say many things ' he said .
' first [???] be wary ! still many men in camp beyond don [???] an hour ' s walk yonder [???] '
he waved his arm west towards the black beacon . ' but none to see between
here and stone - folk ' s new walls . many busy there . walls stand up no longer :
[???] knock them down with earth - thunder and with clubs of black iron . they
are unwary and do not look about them . they think their friends watch all
roads ! ' at that old [???] made a curious [???] noise [???] and it seemed that
he was laughing .
' good tidings ! ' cried jomer . ' even in this gloom hope gleams again . our
enemy ' s devices oft serve us in his despite . the accursed darkness itself
has been a cloak to us . and now [???] lusting to destroy [???] and throw it down
stone from stone [???] his [???] have taken away my greatest fear . the out - wall
could have been held long against us . now we can sweep through - if once we
win so far . '
' once again i thank you [???] [???] - buri - [???] of the woods [???] ' said [???] .
' good fortune go with you for tidings and for [???] ! '
' kill [???] ! kill orc - folk ! no other words please wild men ' answered
[???] . ' drive away bad air and darkness with bright iron ! '
' to do these things we have ridden far [???] ' said the king [???] ' and we shall
attempt them . but what we shall achieve only tomorrow will show . '
[???] - buri - [???] [???] down and touched the earth with his horny brow
in token of farewell . then he got up as if to depart . but suddenly he stood
looking u p like some startled woodland animal snuffling a strange air . a
light came in his eyes .
' wind is changing ! ' he cried [???] and with that [???] in a [???] as it
seemed [???] he and his fellows had vanished into the [???] [???] never to be seen by
any rider of [???] again . not long after far away eastward the faint drums
[???] again . yet to no heart in all the host came any fear that the wild
men were [???] [???] strange and [???] though they might appear .
' we need no further [???] [???] ' said e [???] ; ' for there are riders in
the host who have ridden down to [???] in days of peace . i for one . when
we come to the road it will veer south [???] and there will lie before us still
seven leagues ere we reach the wall of the [???] . along most of that way
there is much grass on either side of the road . on that stretch the
errand - riders of [???] reckoned to make their greatest speed . we may ride
it swiftly and without great rumour . '
' then since we must look for fell deeds and the need of all our

strength [???] ' said jomer [???] ' i counsel that we rest now [???] and set out hence by
night [???] and so time our going that we come upon the fields when tomorrow is
as light as it will be [???] or when our lord gives the signal . '
to this the king assented [???] and the captains departed . but soon [???]
returned . ' the scouts have found naught to report beyond the grey wood [???]
lord [???] ' he said [???] ' save two men only : two dead men and two dead horses . '
' well ? ' said jomer . ' what of it ? '
' this [???] lord : they were errand - riders of [???] ; [???] was one maybe .
at least his hand still clasped the red arrow [???] but his head was hewn off .
and this also : it would seem by the signs that they were [???] westward
when they fell . as i read it [???] they found the enemy already on the out - wall [???]
or assailing it [???] when they returned - and that would be two nights ago [???] if
they used fresh horses from the posts [???] as is their wont . they could not
reach the city and turned back . '
' alas ! ' said [???] . ' t hen [???] has heard no news of our riding
and will despair of our coming . '
' need brooks no delay [???] yet late is better than never [???] ' said jomer . ' and
[???] in this time shall the old saw be proved truer than ever before since
men spoke with mouth . '
it was night . on either side of the road the host of [???] was moving
silently . now the road passing about the skirts of [???] turned
southward . far away and almost straight ahead there was a red glow under the
black sky and the sides of the great mountain loomed dark against it . they
were drawing near the rammas of the [???] ; but the day was not yet come .
the king rode in the midst of the leading company [???] his household - men
about him . [???] ' s jored came next ; and now merry noticed that [???]
had left his place and in the darkness was moving steadily forward [???] until at
last he was riding just in rear of the king ' s guard . there came a check .
merry heard voices in front speaking softly . out - riders had come back who
had ventured forward almost to the wall . they came to the king .
' there are great fires [???] lord [???] ' said one . ' the city is all set about
with flame [???] and the field is full of foes . but all seem drawn off to the
assault . as well as we could guess [???] there are few left upon the out - wall [???]
and they are heedless [???] busy in destruction . '
' do you remember the wild man ' s words [???] lord ? ' said another . ' i live
upon the open wold in days of peace ; [???] is my name [???] and to me also the
air brings messages . already the wind is turning . there comes a breath out

of the south ; there is a sea - tang in it [???] faint though it be . the morning
will bring new things . above the reek it will be dawn when you pass the
wall . '
' if you speak truly [???] [???] [???] then may you live beyond this day in
years of blessedness ! ' said [???] . he turned to the men of his household
who were near [???] and he spoke now in a clear voice so that many also of the
riders of the first jored heard him :
' now is the hour come [???] riders of the mark [???] sons of [???] ! foes and fire
are before you [???] and your homes far behind . yet [???] though you fight upon an
alien field [???] the glory that you reap there shall be your own for ever . oaths
ye have taken : now fulfil them all [???] to lord and land and league of
friendship ! '
men [???] spear upon shield .
' jomer [???] my son ! you lead the first jored [???] ' said [???] ; ' and it shall
go behind the king ' s banner in the centre . [???] [???] lead your company to the
right when we pass the wall . and [???] shall lead his towards the left .
let the other companies behind follow these three that lead [???] as they have
chance . strike wherever the enemy gathers . other plans we cannot make [???] for
we know not yet how things stand upon the field . forth now [???] and fear no
darkness ! '
the leading company rode off as swiftly as they could [???] for it was still
deep dark [???] whatever change [???] might [???] . merry was riding
behind
[???] [???] clutching with the left hand while with the other he tried to
loosen his sword in its sheath . he felt now bitterly the truth of the old
king ' s words : in such a battle what would you do [???] ? just this [???] ' he
thought : ' encumber a rider [???] and hope at best to stay in my seat and not be
pounded to death by [???] [???] ! '
it was no more than a league to where the out - walls had stood . they
soon reached them ; too soon for merry . wild cries broke out [???] and there was
some clash of arms [???] but it was brief . the [???] busy about the walls were few
and amazed [???] and they were quickly slain or driven off . before the ruin of
the north - gate in the rammas the king halted again . the first jored drew up
behind him and about him on either side . [???] kept close to the king [???]
though [???] ' s company was away on the right . [???] ' s men turned
aside
and passed round to a great gap in the wall further eastward .

merry peered from behind [???] ' s back . far away [???] maybe ten miles or
more [???] there was a great burning [???] but between it and the riders lines of fire
blazed in a vast [???] [???] at the nearest point less than a league distant .
he could make out little more on the dark plain [???] and as yet he neither saw
any hope of morning [???] nor felt any wind [???] changed or unchanged .
now silently the host of [???] moved forward into the field of [???] [???]
pouring in slowly but steadily [???] like the rising tide through breaches in a
dike that men have thought secure . but the mind and will of the black
captain were bent wholly on the falling city [???] and as yet no tidings came to
him warning that his designs held any flaw .
after a while the king led his men away somewhat eastward [???] to come
between the fires of the siege and the outer fields . still they were
[???] [???] and still [???] gave no signal . at last he halted once
again . the city was now nearer . a smell of burning was in the air and a very
shadow of death . the horses were uneasy . but the king sat upon [???] [???]
motionless [???] gazing upon the agony of minas [???] [???] as i f [???] suddenly
by anguish [???] or by dread . he seemed to shrink down [???] cowed by age . merry
himself felt as if a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him .
his heart beat slowly . time seemed poised in uncertainty . they were too
late ! too late was worse than never ! perhaps [???] would quail [???] bow his
old head [???] turn [???] slink away to hide in the hills .
then suddenly merry felt it at last [???] beyond doubt : a change . wind was
in his face ! light was [???] . far [???] far away [???] in the south the clouds
could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes [???] rolling up [???] drifting : morning lay
beyond them .
but at that same moment there was a flash [???] as if lightning had sprung
from the earth beneath the city . for a searing second it stood [???] far
off in black and white [???] its topmost tower like a glittering needle : and then
as the darkness closed again there came rolling over the fields a great
boom .
at that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect . tall
and proud he seemed again ; and rising in his [???] he cried in a loud
voice [???] more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before :
arise [???] arise [???] riders of [???] !
fell deeds awake : fire and slaughter !
spear shall be shaken [???] shie ld be [???] [???]
a sword - day [???] a red day [???] ere the sun rises !

ride now [???] ride now ! ride to [???] !
with that he seized a great horn from [???] his banner - bearer [???] and he
blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder . and straightway all the
horns in the host were lifted up in music [???] and the blowing of the horns of
[???] in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the
mountains .
ride now [???] ride now ! ride to [???] !
suddenly the king cried to [???] and the horse sprang away . behind
him his banner blew in the wind [???] white horse upon a field of green [???] but he
[???] it . after him thundered the knights of his house [???] but he was ever
before them . jomer rode there [???] the white [???] on his helm floating in
his speed [???] and the front of the first jored roared like a breaker foaming to
the shore [???] but [???] could not be overtaken . fey he seemed [???] or the
battle - fury of his fathers ran like new tire in his veins [???] and he was borne
up on [???] lik e a god of old [???] even as [???] the great in the battle of
the valar when the world was young . his golden shield was uncovered [???] and lo !
it shone like an image of the sun [???] and the grass flamed into green about the
white feet of his steed . for morning came [???] morning and a wind from the sea ;
and the darkness was removed [???] and the hosts of [???] wailed [???] and terror
took them [???] and they fled [???] and died [???] and the [???] of wrath rode over them .
and then all the host of [???] burst into song [???] and they sang as they slew [???]
for the joy of battle was on them [???] and the sound of their singing that was
fair and terrible came even to the city .




chapter 6 . the battle of the [???]
fields



but it was no orc - chieftain or [???] that led the assault upon
[???] . the darkness was breaking too soon [???] before the date that his master
had set for it : fortune had betrayed him for the moment [???] and the world had
turned against him ; victory was slipping from his grasp even as he stretched
out his hand to seize it . but his arm was long . he was still in command [???]
[???] great powers . king [???] [???] [???] lord of the [???] [???] he had many
weapons . he left the gate and vanished .
[???] king of the mark had reached the road from the gate to the
river [???] and he turned towards the city that was now less than a mile distant .
he slackened his speed a little [???] seeking new foes [???] and his knights came
about him [???] and [???] was with them . ahead nearer the walls [???] ' s
men
were among the siege - engines [???] hewing [???] slaying [???] driving their foes into the
fire - pits . well nigh all the northern half of the [???] was [???] [???] and
there camps were blazing [???] [???] were flying towards the river like herds
before the hunters ; and the [???] went hither and thither at their will .
but they had not yet overthrown the siege [???] nor won the gate . many foes stood
before it [???] and on the further half of the plain were other hosts still
unfought . southward beyond the road lay the main force of the [???] [???] and
there their horsemen were gathered about the standard of their chieftain .
and he looked out [???] and in the growing light he saw the banner of the king [???]
and that it was far ahead of the battle with few men about it . then he was
filled with a red wrath and shouted aloud [???] and displaying his standard [???]
black serpent upon scarlet [???] he came against the white horse and the green
with great press of men ; and the drawing of the [???] of the southrons
was like a glitter of stars .
then [???] was aware of him [???] and would not wait for his onset [???] but
crying to [???] he charged headlong to greet him . great was the clash of
their meeting . but the white fury of the northmen burned the hotter [???] and
more skilled was their knighthood with long spears and bitter . fewer were
they but they clove through the southrons like a fire - bolt in a forest .
right through the press drove [???] [???] ' s son [???] and his spear was

shivered as he threw down their chieftain . out swept his sword [???] and he
spurred to the standard [???] hewed staff and bearer ; and the black serpent
foundered . then all that was left unslain of their [???] turned and fled
far away .
but lo ! suddenly in the midst of the glory of the king his golden
shield was dimmed . the new morning was blotted from the sky . dark fell
about
him . horses reared and screamed . men cast from the saddle lay grovelling on
the ground .
' to me ! to me ! ' cried [???] . ' up [???] ! fear no darkness ! ' but
[???] wild with terror stood up on high [???] fighting with the air [???] and then
with a great scream he [???] upon his side : a black dart had pierced him .
the king fell beneath him .
the great shadow descended like a falling cloud . and behold ! it was a
winged creature : if bird [???] then greater than all other birds [???] and it was
naked [???] and neither quill nor feather did it bear [???] and its vast pinions were
as webs of hide between horned fingers ; and it stank . a creature of an older
world maybe it was [???] whose kind [???] fingering in forgotten mountains cold
beneath the moon [???] [???] their day [???] and in hideous eyrie bred this last
untimely brood [???] apt to evil . and the dark lord took it [???] and nursed it with
fell meats [???] until it grew beyond the measure of all other things that fly ;
and he gave it to his servant to be his steed . down [???] down it came [???] and then [???]
folding its fingered webs [???] it gave a croaking cry [???] and settled upon the body
of [???] [???] digging in its claws [???] stooping its long naked neck .
upon it sat a shape [???] black - mantled [???] huge and threatening . a crown of
steel he bore [???] but between rim and robe naught was there to see [???] save only a
deadly gleam of eyes : the lord of the [???] . to the air he had returned [???]
summoning his steed ere the darkness failed [???] and now he was come again [???]
bringing ruin [???] turning hope to despair [???] and victory to death . a great black
mace he [???] .
but [???] was not utterly forsaken . the knights of his house lay
slain about him [???] or else mastered by the madness of their steeds were borne
far away . yet one stood there still : [???] the young [???] faithful beyond
fear ; and he wept [???] for he had loved his lord as a father . right through the
charge merry had been borne [???] behind him [???] until the shadow came ;
and
then [???] had thrown them in his terror [???] and now ran wild upon the

plain . merry [???] on all fours like a dazed beast [???] and such a horror was
on him that he was blind and sick .
' king ' s man ! king ' s man ! ' his heart cried within him . ' you must stay by
him . as a father you shall be to me [???] you said . ' but his will made no answer [???]
and his body shook . he dared not open his eyes or look up .
then out of the blackness in his mind he thought that he heard [???]
speaking ; yet now the voice seemed strange [???] recalling some other voice that
he had known .
' begone [???] foul [???] [???] lord of carrion ! leave the dead in peace ! '
a cold voice answered : ' come not between the [???] and his prey ! or he
will not slay thee in thy turn . he will bear thee away to the houses of
lamentation [???] beyond all darkness [???] where thy flesh shall be devoured [???] and thy
[???] mind be left naked to the [???] eye . '
a sword rang as it was drawn . ' do what you will ; but i will hinder it [???]
if i may . '
' hinder me ? thou fool . no living man may hinder me ! '
then merry heard of all sounds in that hour the strangest . it seemed
that [???] laughed [???] and the clear voice was like the ring of steel . ' but
no living man am i ! you look upon a woman . [???] i am [???] jomund ' s
daughter .
you stand between me and my lord and kin . begone [???] if you be not deathless !
for living or dark undead [???] i will smite you [???] if you touch him . '
the winged creature screamed at her [???] but the [???] made no answer [???]
and was silent [???] as if in sudden doubt . very amazement for a moment conquered
merry ' s fear . he opened his eyes and the blackness was lifted from them .
there some paces from him sat the great beast [???] and all seemed dark about it [???]
and above it loomed the [???] lord like a shadow of despa ir . a little to
the left facing them stood she whom he had called [???] . but the helm of
her secrecy [???] had fallen from her [???] and her bright hair [???] released from its
bonds [???] gleamed with pale gold upon her shoulders . her eyes grey as the sea
were hard and fell [???] and yet tears were on her cheek . a sword was in her
hand [???] and she raised her shield against the horror of her enemy ' s eyes .
[???] it was [???] and [???] also . for into merry ' s mind flashed the
memory of the face that he saw at the riding from [???] : the face of one
that goes seeking death [???] having no hope . pity filled his heart and great
wonder [???] and suddenly the slow - kindled courage of his race awoke . he [???]
his hand . she should not die [???] so fair [???] so desperate at least she should not

die alone [???] [???] .
the face of their enemy was not turned towards him [???] but still he hardly
dared to move [???] dreading lest the deadly eyes should fall on him . slowly [???]
slowly he began to [???] aside ; but the black captain [???] in doubt and malice
intent upon the woman before him [???] heeded him no more than a worm in the
mud .
suddenly the great beast beat its hideous wings [???] and the wind of them
was foul . again it leaped into the air [???] and then swiftly fell down upon
[???] [???] shrieking [???] striking with beak and claw .
still she did not blench : maiden of the [???] [???] child of kings [???]
slender but as a steel - blade [???] fair but terrible . a swift stroke she dealt [???]
skilled and deadly . the [???] neck she clove asunder [???] and the hewn
head fell like a stone . backward she sprang as the huge shape [???] to
ruin [???] vast wings [???] [???] [???] on the earth ; and with its fall the
shadow passed away . a light fell about her [???] and her hair shone in the
[???] .
out of the wreck rose the black rider [???] tall and threatening [???] towering
above her . with a cry of hatred that stung the very ears like venom he let
fall his mace . her shield was shivered in many pieces [???] and her arm was
broken ; she [???] to her knees . he bent over her like a cloud [???] and his
eyes glittered ; he raised his mace to kill .
but suddenly he too [???] forward with a cry of bitter pain [???] and his
stroke went wide [???] driving into the ground . merry ' s sword had stabbed him
from behind [???] shearing through the black mantle [???] and passing up beneath the
[???] had pierced the sinew behind his mighty knee .
' [???] ! [???] ! ' cried merry . then tottering [???] struggling up [???] with her
last strength she drove her sword between crown and mantle [???] as the great
shoulders bowed before her . the sword broke sparkling into many shards . the
crown rolled away with a clang . [???] fell forward upon her fallen foe . but
lo ! the mantle and [???] were empty . shapeless they lay now on the ground [???]
torn and tumbled ; and a cry went up into the [???] air [???] and faded to a
shrill wailing [???] passing with the wind [???] a voice bodiless and thin that died [???]
and was swallowed up [???] and was never heard again in that age of this world .
and there stood [???] the hobbit in the midst of the slain [???] blinking
like an owl in the daylight [???] for tears blinded him ; and through a mist he
looked on [???] ' s fair head [???] as she lay and did not move ; and he looked on
the face of the king [???] fallen in the midst of his glory [???] for [???] in his

agony had rolled away from him again ; yet he was the bane of his master .
then merry stooped and lifted his hand to kiss it [???] and lo ! [???]
opened his eyes [???] and they were clear [???] and he spoke in a quiet voice though
laboured .
' farewell [???] master [???] ! ' he said . ' my body is broken . i go to my
fathers . and even in their mighty company i shall not now be ashamed . i
felled the black serpent . a grim morn [???] and a glad day [???] and a golden sunset ! '
merry could not speak [???] bu t wept anew . ' forgive me [???] lord [???] ' he said at
last [???] ' if i broke your command [???] and yet have done no more in your service
than to weep at our parting . '
the old king smiled . ' grieve not ! it is forgiven . great heart will not
be denied . live now in blessedness ; and when you sit in peace with your
pipe [???] think of me ! for never now shall i sit with you in [???] [???] as i
promised [???] or listen to your herb - lore . ' he closed his eyes [???] and merry bowed
beside him . presently he spoke again . ' where is jomer ? for my eyes darken [???]
and i would see him ere i go . he must be king after me . and i would send
word to [???] . she [???] she would not have me leave her [???] and now i shall not see
her again [???] dearer than daughter . '
' lord [???] lord [???] ' began merry brokenly [???] ' she is - - ' ; but at that moment
there was a great clamour [???] and all about them horns and trumpets were
blowing . merry looked round : he had forgotten the war [???] and all the world
beside [???] and many hours it seemed since the king rode to his fall [???] though in
truth it was only a little while . but now he saw that they were in danger of
being caught in the very midst of the great battle that would soon be
joined .
new forces of the enemy were hastening up the road from the river ; and
from u nder the walls came the legions of [???] ; and from the southward
fields came footmen of harad with horsemen before them [???] and behind them
rose
the huge backs of the [???] with war - towers upon them . but northward the
white crest of jomer led the great front of the [???] which he had again
gathered and marshalled ; and out of the city came all the strength of men
that was in it [???] and the silver swan of dol amroth was borne in the van [???]
driving the enemy from the gate .
for a moment the thought flitted through merry ' s mind : ' where is
[???] ? is he not here ? could he not have saved the king and [???] ? ' but
thereupon jomer rode up in haste [???] and with him came the knights of the

household that still lived and had now mastered their horses . they looked in
wonder at the carcase of the fell beast that lay there : and their steeds
would not go near . but jomer leaped from the saddle [???] and grief and dismay
fell upon him as he came to the king ' s side and stood there in silence .
then one of the knights took the king ' s banner from the hand of [???]
the banner - bearer who lay dead [???] and he lifted it up . slowly [???] opened
his eyes . seeing the banner he made a sign that it should be given to jomer .
' hail [???] king of the mark ! ' he said . ' ride now to victory ! bid [???]
farewell ! ' and so he died [???] and knew not that [???] lay near him . and those
who stood by wept [???] crying : ' [???] king ! [???] king ! '
but jomer said to them :
mourn not [???] ! mighty was the fallen [???]
meet was his ending . when his mound is raised [???]
women then shall weep . war now calls us !
yet he himself wept as he spoke . ' let his knights remain here [???] ' he
said ; ' and bear his body in honour from the field [???] lest the battle ride over
it ! yea [???] and all these other of the king ' s men that lie here . ' and he looked
at the slain [???] recalling their names . then suddenly he beheld his sister
[???] as she lay [???] and he knew her . he stood a moment as a man who is
pierced
in the midst of a cry by an arrow through the heart ; and then his face went
deathly white ; and a cold fury rose in him [???] so that all speech failed him
for a while . a fey mood took him .
' [???] [???] [???] ! ' he cried at last : ' [???] [???] how come you here ? what
madness or devilry is this ? death [???] death [???] death ! death take us all ! '
then without taking counsel or waiting for the approach of the men of
the city [???] he spurred headlong back to the front of the great host [???] and blew
a horn [???] and cried aloud for the onset . over the field rang his clear voice
calling : ' death ! ride [???] ride to ruin and the world ' s ending ! '
and with that the host began to move . but the [???] sang no more .
death they cried with one voice loud and terrible [???] and gathering speed like
a great tide their battle swept about their fallen king and passed [???] roaring
away southwards .
and still [???] the hobbit stood there blinking through his tears
and no one spoke to him [???] indeed none seemed to heed him . he brushed away
the
tears [???] and stooped to pick up the green shield that [???] had given him ; and

he slung it at his back . then he looked for his sword that he had let fall ;
for even as he struck his blow his arm was numbed [???] and now he could only use
his left hand . and behold ! there lay his weapon [???] but the blade was smoking
like a dry branch that has been thrust in a fire ; and as he watched it [???] it
[???] and withered and was consumed .
so passed the sword of the barrow - downs [???] work of westernesse . but glad
would he have been to know its fate who wrought it slowly long ago in the
north - kingdom when the d [???] nedain were young [???] and chief among their foes
was
the dread realm of [???] and its [???] king . no other blade [???] not though
mightier hands had [???] it [???] would have dealt that foe a wound so bitter [???]
cleaving the undead flesh [???] breaking the spell that knit his unseen sinews to
his will .
men now raised the king [???] and laying cloaks upon spear - truncheons they
made shift to bear him away towards the city ; and others lifted [???] gently
up and bore her after him . but the men of the king ' s household they could
not yet bring from the field ; for seven of the king ' s knights had fallen
there [???] and [???] their chief was among them . so they laid them apart from
their foes and the fell beast and set spears about them . and afterwards when
all was over men returned and made a fire there and burned the carcase of
the beast ; but for [???] they dug a grave and set up a stone upon which
was carved in the tongues of [???] and the mark :
faithful servant yet master ' s bane
lightfoot ' s foal [???] swift [???] .
green and long grew the grass on [???] ' s howe [???] but ever black and
bare was the ground where the beast was burned .
now slowly and sadly merry walked beside the bearers [???] and he gave no
more heed to the battle . he was weary and full of pain [???] and his limbs
trembled as with a chill . a great rain came out of the sea [???] and it seemed
that all things wept for [???] and [???] [???] quenching the fires in the city
with grey tears . it was through a mist that presently he saw the van of the
men of [???] approaching . [???] [???] prince of dol amroth [???] rode up and
drew
rein before them .
' what burden do you bear [???] men of [???] ? ' he cried .
' [???] king [???] ' they answered . ' he is dead . but jomer king now rides in
the battle : he with the white crest in the wind . '

then the prince went from his horse [???] and knelt by the bier in honour of
the king and his great onset ; and he wept . and rising he looked then on
[???] and was amazed . ' surely [???] here is a woman ? ' he said . ' have even the
women of the [???] come to war in our need ? '
' nay ! one only [???] ' they answered . ' the lady [???] is she [???] sister of
jomer ; and we knew naught of her riding until this hour [???] and greatly we rue
it . '
then the prince seeing her beauty [???] though her face was pale and cold [???]
touched her hand as he bent to look more closely on her . ' men of [???] ! ' he
cried . ' are there no [???] among you ? she is hurt to the death maybe [???] but
i deem that she yet lives . ' and he held the bright - burnished [???] that
was upon his arm before her cold tips [???] and behold ! a little mist was laid on
it hardly to be seen .
' haste now is needed [???] ' he said [???] and he sent one riding back swiftly to
the city to bring aid . but he bowing low to the fallen [???] bade them farewell [???]
and mounting rode away into battle .
and now the fighting waxed furious on the fields of the [???] ; and
the din of arms rose upon high [???] with the crying of men and the neighing of
horses . horns were blown and trumpets were braying [???] and the [???] were
[???] as they were goaded to war . under the south walls of the city the
footmen of [???] now drove against the legions of [???] that were still
gathered there in strength . but the horsemen rode eastward to the succour of
jomer : h [???] rin the tall warden of the keys [???] and the lord of [???] [???] and
[???] of the green hills [???] and prince [???] the fair with his knights all
about him .
not too soon came their aid to the [???] ; for fortune had turned
against jomer [???] and his fury had betrayed him . the great wrath of his onset
had utterly overthrown the front of his enemies [???] and great wedges of his
riders had passed clear through the ranks of the southrons [???] [???]
their horsemen and riding their footmen to ruin . but wherever the [???]
came there the horses would not go [???] but [???] and [???] away ; and the
great monsters were unfought [???] and stood like towers of defence [???] and the
[???] [???] about them . and if the [???] at their onset were thrice
[???] by the [???] alone [???] soon their case became worse ; for new
strength came now streaming to the field out of [???] . there they had
been mustered for the sack of the city and the rape of [???] [???] waiting on
the call of their captain . he now was destroyed ; but [???] the lieutenant

of [???] had flung them into the fray ; [???] with axes [???] and [???]
of khand . southrons in scarlet [???] and out of far harad black men like
half - [???] with white eyes and red tongues . some now hastened up behind the
[???] [???] others held westward to hold off the forces of [???] and prevent
their joining with [???] .
it was even as the day thus began to turn against [???] and their hope
wavered that a new cry went up in the city [???] it being then [???] [???] and a
great wind blowing [???] and the rain flying north [???] and the sun shining . in that
clear air watchmen on the walls saw afar a new sight of fear [???] and their last
hope left them .
for [???] [???] from the bend at the [???] [???] so flowed that from the city
men could look down it lengthwise for some leagues [???] and the far - sighted
could see any ships that approached . and looking thither they cried in
dismay ; for black against the glittering stream they beheld a fleet borne up
on the wind : [???] [???] and ships of great draught with many oars [???] and with
black sails bellying in the breeze .
' the [???] of [???] ! ' men shouted . ' the [???] of [???] ! look ! the
[???] of [???] are coming ! so [???] is taken [???] and the [???] [???] and
[???] is gone . the [???] are upon us ! it is the last stroke of doom ! '
and some without order [???] for none could he found to command them in the
city [???] ran to the bells and tolled the alarm ; and some blew the trumpets
sounding the retreat . ' back to the walls ! ' they cried . ' back to the walls !
come back to the city before all are overwhelmed ! ' but the wind that sped
the ships blew all their clamour away .
the [???] indeed had no need of news or alarm . all too well they
could see for themselves the black sails . for jomer was now scarcely a mile
from the [???] [???] and a great press of his first foes was between him and
the haven there [???] while new foes came [???] behind [???] cutting him off from
the prince . now he looked to the river [???] and hope died in his heart [???] and the
wind that he had blessed he now called accursed . but the hosts of [???]
were [???] [???] and filled with a new lust and fury they came yelling to
the onset .
stern now was jomer ' s mood [???] and his mind clear again . he let blow the
horns to rally all men to his banner that could come thither ; for he thought
to make a great shield - wall at the last [???] and stand [???] and fight there on foot
till all fell [???] and do deeds of song on the fields of [???] [???] though no man
should be left in the west to remember the last king of the mark . so he rode

to a green hillock and there set his banner [???] and the white horse ran
[???] in the wind .
out of doubt [???] out of dark to the day ' s rising
i came singing in the sun [???] sword [???] .
to hope ' s end i rode and to heart ' s breaking :
now for wrath [???] now for ruin and a red nightfall !
these staves he spoke [???] yet he laughed as he said them . for once more
lust of battle was on him ; and he was still [???] [???] and he was young [???] and
he was king : the lord of a fell people . and lo ! even as he laughed at
despair he looked out again on the black ships [???] and he lifted up his sword
to defy them .
and then wonder took him [???] and a great joy ; and he cast his sword up in
the sunlight and sang as he caught it . and all eyes followed his gaze [???] and
behold ! upon the foremost ship a great standard broke [???] and the wind
displayed it as she turned towards the [???] . there flowered a white tree [???]
and that was for [???] ; but seven stars were about it [???] and a high crown
above it [???] the signs of [???] that no lord had borne for years beyond
count . and the stars flamed in the sunlight [???] for they were wrought of gems
by [???] daughter of [???] ; and the crown was bright in the morning [???] for it
was wrought of [???] and gold .
thus came [???] son of [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] ' s heir [???] out of the
paths of the dead [???] borne upon a wind from the sea to the kingdom of [???] ;
and the mirth of the [???] was a torrent of laughter and a flashing of
swords [???] and the joy and wonder of the city was a music of trumpets and a
ringing of bells . but the hosts of [???] wer e seized with [???] [???] and
a great [???] it seemed to them that their own ships should be filled
with their foes ; and a black dread fell on them [???] knowing that the tides of
fate had turned against them and their doom was at hand .
east rode the knights of dol amroth driving the enemy before them :
troll - men and [???] and [???] that hated the sunlight . south strode jomer
and men fled before his face [???] and they were caught between the hammer and
the anvil . for now men leaped from the ships to the quays of the [???] and
swept north like a storm . there came legolas [???] and [???] [???] his axe [???]
and [???] with the standard [???] and [???] and [???] with stars on their
brow [???] and the dour - handed d [???] nedain [???] rangers of the north [???] leading a great
valour of the folk of [???] and [???] and the [???] of the south . but
before all went [???] with the flame of the west [???] and [???] ril like a new fire

kindled [???] [???] re - forged as deadly as of old : and upon his brow was the
star of [???] .
and so at length jomer and [???] met in the midst of the battle [???] and
they leaned on their swords and looked on one another and were glad .
' thus we meet again [???] though all the hosts of [???] lay between us [???] '
said [???] . ' did i not say so at the [???] ? '
' so you spoke [???] ' said jomer [???] ' but hope oft deceives [???] and i knew not then
that you were a man [???] . yet twice blessed is help [???] for [???] and
never was a meeting of friends more joyful . ' and they clasped hand in hand .
' nor indeed more timely [???] ' said jomer . ' you come none too soon [???] my friend .
much loss and sorrow has befallen us . '
' then let us avenge it [???] ere we speak of it ! ' said [???] [???] and they
rode back to battle together .
hard fighting and long labour they had still ; for the southrons were
bold men and grim [???] and fierce in despair ; and the [???] were strong
and war - hardened and asked for no quarter . and so in this place and that [???] by
burned [???] or barn [???] upon hillock or mound [???] under wa ll or on field [???]
still they gathered and [???] and fought until the day wore away .
then the sun went at last behind [???] and filled all the sky with
a great burning [???] so that the hills and the mountains were dyed as with
blood ; fire glowed in the river [???] and the grass of the [???] lay red in
the nightfall . and in that hour the great battle of the field of [???] was
over ; and not one living foe was left within the circuit of the rammas . all
were slain save those who fled to die [???] or to drown in the red foam of the
river . few ever came eastward to [???] or [???] ; and to the land of the
[???] came only a tale from far off : a rumour of the wrath and terror of
[???] .
[???] and jomer and [???] rode back towards the gate of the city [???]
and they were now weary beyond joy or sorrow . these three were [???] [???]
for such was their fortune and the skill and might of their arms [???] and few
indeed had dared to abide them or look on their faces in the hour of their
wrath . but many others were hurt or [???] or dead upon the field . the axes
hewed forlong as he fought alone and [???] ; and both [???] of [???]
and his brother were trampled to death when they assailed the [???] [???]
leading their bowmen close to shoot at the eyes of the monsters . neither
[???] the fair would return to [???] gelin [???] nor [???] to [???] [???]
nor [???] to the [???] [???] dour - handed ranger . no few had fallen [???]

renowned or nameless [???] captain or soldier ; for it was a great battle and the
full count of it no tale has told . so long afterward a maker in [???] said
in his song of the mounds of [???] :
we heard of the horns in the hills ringing [???]
the swords shining in the south - kingdom .
steeds went striding to the [???]
as wind in the morning . war was kindled .
there [???] fell [???] [???] mighty [???]
to his golden halls and green pastures
in the northern fields never returning [???]
high lord of the host . harding and [???]
d [???] nhere and [???] [???] [???] [???] [???]
[???] and [???] [???] horn and fastred [???]
fought and fell there in a far country :
in the mounds of [???] under mould they lie
with their league - fellows [???] lords of [???] .
neither [???] the fair to the hills by the sea [???]
nor forlong the old to the flowering vales
ever [???] to [???] [???] to his own country
returned in triumph ; nor the tall bowmen [???]
[???] and [???] [???] to their dark waters [???]
meres of [???] under mountain - shadows .
death in the morning and at day ' s ending
lords took and lowly . long now they sleep
under grass in [???] by the great river .
grey now as tears [???] gleaming silver [???]
red then it rolled [???] roaring water :
foam dyed with blood flamed a t sunset ;
as [???] mountains burned at evening ;
red fell the dew in rammas echor .




chapter 7 . the pyre of [???]



when the dark shadow at the gate withdrew [???] still sat motionless .
but [???] rose to his feet [???] as if a great weight had been lifted from him ;
and he stood listening to the horns [???] and it seemed to him that they would
break his heart with joy . and never in after years could he hear a horn
blown in the distance without tears starting in his eyes . but now suddenly
his errand returned to his memory [???] and he ran forward . at that moment
[???] stirred and spoke to [???] [???] and was about to ride through the
gate .
' [???] [???] [???] ! ' cried [???] [???] and [???] halted .
' what are you doing here ? ' said [???] . ' is it not a law in the city
that those who wear the black and silver must stay in the [???] [???] unless
their lord gives them leave ? '
' he has [???] ' said [???] . ' he sent me away . but i am frightened . something
terrible may happen up there . the lord is out of his mind [???] i think . i am
afraid he will kill himself [???] and kill [???] too . can ' t you do something ? '
[???] looked through the gaping gate [???] and already on the fields he
heard the gathering sound of battle . he [???] his hand . ' i must go ' he
said . ' the black rider is abroad [???] and he will yet bring ruin on us . i have
no time . '
' but [???] ! ' cried [???] . ' he is not dead [???] and they will burn him
alive [???] if someone does not stop them . '
' burn him alive ? ' said [???] . ' what is this tale ? be quick ! '
' [???] has gone to the tombs [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and he has taken
[???] [???] and he says we are all to burn [???] and he will not wait [???] and they are
to make a pyre and burn him on it [???] and [???] as well . and he has sent men
to fetch wood and oil . and i have told [???] [???] but i ' m afraid he won ' t
dare to leave his post : he is on guard . and what can he do anyway ? ' so
[???] poured out his tale [???] reaching up and touching [???] ' s knee with
trembling hands . ' can ' t you save [???] ? '
' maybe i can [???] ' said [???] ; ' but if i do [???] then others will die [???] i
fear . well [???] i must come [???] since no other help can reach him . but evil and
sorrow will come of this . even in the heart of our stronghold the enemy has
power to strike us : for his will it is that is at work . '

then having made up his mind he acted swiftly ; and catching up [???]
and setting him before him [???] he turned [???] with a word . up the climbing
streets of minas [???] they [???] [???] while the noise of war rose behind
them . everywhere men were rising from their despair and dread [???] seizing their
weapons [???] crying one to another : ' [???] has come ! ' captains were shouting [???]
companies were mustering ; many already were marching down to the gate .
they met the prince [???] [???] and he called to them : ' whither now [???]
[???] ? the [???] are fighting on the fields of [???] ! we must
gather all the strength that we can find . '
' you will need every man and more [???] ' said [???] . ' make all haste . i
will come when i can . but i have an errand to the lord [???] that will
not wait . take command in the lord ' s absence ! '
they passed on ; and as they climbed and drew near to the [???] they
felt the wind blowing in their faces [???] and they caught the glimmer of morning
far away [???] a light growing in the southern sky . but it brought little hope to
them [???] not knowing what evil lay before them [???] fearing to come too late .
' darkness is passing [???] ' said [???] [???] ' but it still lies heavy on this
city . '
at the gate of the [???] they found no guard . ' then [???] has
gone [???] ' said [???] more hopefully . they turned away and hastened along the
road to the closed door . it stood wide open [???] and the porter lay before it .
he was slain and his key had been taken .
' work of the enemy ! ' said [???] . ' such deeds he loves : friend at war
with friend ; loyalty divided in confusion of hearts . ' now he [???] and
bade [???] return to his stable . ' for [???] my friend [???] ' he said [???] ' you and i
should have ridden to the fields long ago [???] but other matters delay me . yet
come swiftly if i call ! '
they passed the door and walked on down the steep winding road . light
was growing [???] and the tall [???] and carven figures beside the way went
slowly by like grey ghosts .
suddenly the silence was broken [???] and they heard below them cries and
the ringing of swords : such sounds as had not been heard in the hallowed
places since the building of the city . at last they came to rath [???] and
hastened towards the house of the stewards [???] looming in the [???] under
its great dome .
' stay ! stay ! ' cried [???] [???] springing forward to the stone stair
before the door . ' stay this madness ! '

for there were the servants of [???] with swords and torches in
their hands ; but alone in the porch upon the topmost step stood [???] [???]
clad in the black and silver of the guard ; and he held the door against
them . two of them had already fallen to his sword [???] staining the hallows with
their blood ; and the others cursed him [???] calling him outlaw and traitor to
his master .
even as [???] and [???] ran forward [???] they heard from within the
house of the dead the voice of [???] crying : ' haste [???] haste ! do as i have
bidden ! slay me this [???] ! or must i do so myself ? ' thereupon the door
which [???] held shut with his left hand was wrenched open [???] and there
behind him stood the lord of the city [???] tall and fell ; a light like flame was
in his eyes [???] a nd he held a drawn sword .
but [???] sprang up the steps [???] and the men fell back from him and
covered their eyes ; for his coming was like the [???] of a white light
into a dark place [???] and he came with great anger . he lifted up his hand [???] and
in the very stroke [???] the sword of [???] flew up and left his grasp and
fell behind him in the shadows of the house ; and [???] stepped backward
before [???] as one amazed .
' what is this [???] my lord ? ' said the [???] . ' the houses of the dead are
no places for the living . and why do men fight here in the hallows when
there is war enough before the gate ? or has our enemy come even to rath
[???] ? '
' since when has the lord of [???] been answerable to thee ? ' said
[???] . ' or may i not command my own servants ? '
' you may [???] ' said [???] . ' but others may contest your will [???] when it is
turned to madness and evil . where is your son [???] [???] ? '
' he lies within [???] ' said [???] [???] ' burning [???] already burning . they have
set a fire in his flesh . but soon all shall be burned . the west has failed .
it shall all go up in a great fire [???] and all shall be ended . ash ! ash and
smoke blown away on the wind ! '
then [???] seeing the madness that was on him feared that he had
already done some evil deed [???] and he thrust forward [???] with [???] and [???]
behind him [???] while [???] gave back until he stood beside the table within .
but there they found [???] [???] still dreaming in his fever [???] lying upon the
table . wood was piled under it [???] and high all about it [???] and all was drenched
with oil [???] even the garments of [???] and the coverlets ; but as yet no fire
had been set to the fuel . then [???] revealed the strength that lay hid in

him ; even as the light of his power was hidden u nder his grey mantle . he
leaped up on to the [???] [???] and raising the sick man lightly he sprang down
again [???] and bore him towards the door . but as he did so [???] moaned and
called on his father in his dream .
[???] started as one waking from a trance [???] and the flame died in his
eyes [???] and he wept ; and he said : ' do not take my son from me ! he calls for
me . '
' he calls [???] ' said [???] [???] ' but you cannot come to him yet . for he must
seek healing on the [???] of death [???] and maybe find it no t . whereas your
part is to go out to the battle of your city [???] where maybe death [???] you .
this you know in your heart . '
' he will not wake again [???] ' said [???] . ' battle is vain . why should we
wish to live longer ? why should we not go to death side by side ? '
' authority is not given to you [???] steward of [???] [???] to order the hour of
your death [???] ' answered [???] . ' and only the heathen kings [???] under the
domination of the dark power [???] did thus [???] slaying themselves in pride and
despair [???] murdering their kin to ease their own death . ' then passing through
the door he took [???] from the deadly house and laid him on the bier on
which he had been brought [???] and which had now been set in the porch . [???]
followed him [???] and stood trembling [???] looking with longing on the face of his
son . and for a moment [???] while all were silent and still [???] watching the lord in
his throes [???] he wavered .
' come ! ' said [???] . ' we are needed . there is much that you can yet
do . '
then suddenly [???] laughed . he stood up tall and proud again [???] and
stepping swiftly back to the table he lifted from it the pillow on which his
head had lain . then coming to the doorway he drew aside the covering [???] and
lo ! he had between his hands a [???] . and as he held it up [???] it seemed to
those that looked on that the globe began to glow with an inner flame [???] so
that the lean face of the lord was lit as with a red fire [???] and it seemed cut
out of hard stone [???] sharp with black shadows [???] noble [???] proud [???] and terrible . his
eyes glittered .
' pride and despair ! ' he cried . ' didst thou think that the eyes of the
white tower were blind ? nay [???] i have seen more than thou knowest [???] grey
fool .
for thy hope is but ignorance . go then and labour in healing ! go forth and
fight ! vanity . for a little space you may triumph on the field [???] for a day .

but against the power that now arises there is no victory . to this city only
the first finger of its hand has yet been stretched . all the east is moving .
and even now the wind of thy hope cheats thee and [???] up [???] a fleet
with black sails . the west has failed . it is time for all to depart who
would not be slaves . '
' such counsels will make the enemy ' s victory certain indeed [???] ' said
[???] .
' hope on then ! ' laughed [???] . ' do i not know thee [???] [???] ? thy
hope is to rule in my stead [???] to stand behind every throne [???] north [???] south [???] or
west . i have read thy mind and its [???] . do i not know that you
commanded this halfling here to keep silence ? that you brought him hither to
be a spy within my very chamber ? and yet in our speech together i have
learned the names and purpose of all thy companions . so ! with the left hand
thou wouldst use me for a little while as a shield against [???] [???] and with
the right bring up this ranger of the north to [???] me .
' but i say to thee [???] [???] [???] [???] i will not be thy tool ! i am
steward of the house of [???] . i will not step down to be the dotard
chamberlain of an [???] . even were his claim proved to me [???] still he comes
but of the line of [???] . i will not bow to such a one [???] last of a ragged
house long bereft of lordship and dignity . '
' what then would you have [???] ' said [???] [???] ' if your will could have its
way ? '
' i would have things as they were in all the days of my life [???] ' answered
[???] [???] ' and in the days of my [???] before me : to be the lord of
this city in peace [???] and leave my chair to a son after me [???] who would be his
own master and no [???] ' s pupil . but if doom denies this to me [???] then i will
have naught : neither life diminished [???] nor love halved [???] nor honour abated . '
' to me it would not seem that a steward who faithfully [???] his
charge is diminished in love or in honour [???] ' said [???] . ' and at the least
you shall not rob your son of his choice while his death is still in doubt . '
at those words [???] ' s eyes flamed again [???] and taking the stone under
his arm he drew a knife and strode towards the bier . but [???] sprang
forward and set himself before [???] .
' so ! ' cried [???] . ' thou hadst already stolen half my son ' s love .
now thou stealest the hearts of my knights also [???] so that they rob me wholly
of my son at the last . but in this at least thou shalt not defy my will : to
rule my own end . '

' come hither ! ' he cried to his servants . ' come [???] if you are not all
recreant ! ' then two of them ran up the steps to him . swiftly he snatched a
torch from the hand of one and sprang back into the house . before [???]
could hinder him he thrust the brand amid the fuel [???] and at once it crackled
and roared into flame .
then [???] leaped upon the table [???] and standing there wreathed in
fire and smoke he took up the staff of his stewardship that lay at his feet
and broke it on his knee . casting the pieces into the blaze he bowed and
laid himself on the table [???] clasping the [???] with both hands upon his
breast . and it was said that ever after [???] if any man looked in that stone [???]
unless he had a great strength of will to turn it to other purpose [???] he saw
only two aged hands withering in flame .
[???] in grief and horror turned his face away and closed the door .
for a while he stood in thought [???] silent upon the [???] [???] while those
outside heard the greedy roaring of the fire within . and then [???] gave
a great cry [???] and afterwards spoke no more [???] nor was ever again seen by mortal
men .
' so passes [???] [???] son of [???] [???] ' said [???] : then he turned to
[???] and the lord ' s servants that stood there [???] . ' and so pass also
the days of [???] that you have known ; for good or evil they are ended . ill
deeds have been done here ; but let now all enmity that lies between you be
put away [???] for it was contrived by the enemy and works his will . you have
been caught in a net of warring duties that you did not weave . but think [???]
you servants of the lord [???] blind in your obedience [???] that but for the treason
of [???] [???] [???] captain of the white tower [???] would now also be burned .
' bear away from this unhappy place your comrades who have fallen . and
we will bear [???] [???] steward of [???] [???] to a place where he can sleep in
peace [???] or die if that be his doom . '
then [???] and [???] taking up the bier bore it away towards the
houses of hea ling [???] while behind them walked [???] with downcast head .
but
the servants of the lord stood gazing as [???] men at the house of the
dead ; and even as [???] came to the end of rath [???] there was a great
noise . looking back they saw the dome of the house crack and smokes issue
forth ; and then with a rush and rumble of stone it fell in a [???] of fire ;
but still [???] the flames danced and [???] among the ruins . then in
terror the servants fled and followed [???] .

at length they came back to the steward ' s door [???] and [???] looked
with grief at the porter . ' this deed i shall ever rue [???] ' he said ; ' but a
madness of haste was on me [???] and he would not listen [???] but drew sword against
me . ' then taking the key that he had wr ested from the slain man he closed
the door and locked it . ' this should now be given to the lord [???] [???] ' he
said .
' the prince of dol amroth is in command in the absence of the lord [???] '
said [???] ; ' but since he is not here [???] i must take this on myself . i bid
you keep the key and guard it [???] until the city is set in order again . '
now at last they passed into the high circles of the city [???] and in the
light of morning they went their way towards the houses of healing ; and
these were fair houses set apart [???] for the care of those who were grievously
sick [???] but now they were prepared for the tending of men hurt in battle or
dying . they stood not far from the [???] - gate [???] in the sixth circle [???] nigh
to its southward wall [???] and about them was a garden and a [???] with
trees [???] the only such place in the city . there dwelt the few women that had
been permitted to remain in minas [???] [???] since they were skilled in healing
or in the service of the healers .
but even as [???] and his companions came carrying the bier to the
main door of the houses [???] they heard a great cry that went up from the field
before the gate and rising shrill and piercing into the sky passed [???] and died
away on the wind . so terrible was the cry that for a moment all stood still [???]
and yet when it had passed [???] suddenly their hearts were lifted up in such a
hope as they had not known since the darkness came out of the east ; and it
seemed to them that the light grew clear and the sun broke through the
clouds .
but [???] ' s face was grave and sad [???] and bidding [???] and [???]
to take [???] into the houses of healing [???] he went up on to the walls
nearby ; and there like a figure carven in white he stood in the new sun and
looked out . and he beheld with the sight that was given to him all that had
befallen ; and when jomer rode out from the forefront of his battle and stood
beside those who lay upon the field [???] he sighed [???] and he cast his cloak about
him again [???] and went from the walls . and [???] and [???] found him
standing in thought before the door of the houses when they came out .
they looked at him [???] and for a while he was silent . at last he spoke .
' my friends [???] ' he said [???] ' and all you people of this city and of the western
lands ! things of great sorrow and renown have come to pass . shall we weep or

be glad ? beyond hope the captain of our foes has been destroyed [???] and you
have heard the echo of his last despair . but he has not gone without woe and
bitter loss . and that i might have averted but for the madness of [???] .
so long has the reach of our enemy become ! alas ! but now i perceive how his
will was able to enter into the very heart of the city .
' though the stewards deemed that it was a secret kept only by
themselves [???] long ago i guessed that here in the white tower [???] one at least of
the seven seeing stones was preserved . in the days of his wisdom [???]
did not presume to use it [???] nor to challenge [???] [???] knowing the limits of
his own strength . but his wisdom failed ; and i fear that as the peril of his
realm grew he looked in the stone and was deceived : far too often [???] i guess [???]
since [???] departed . he was too great to be subdued to the will of the
dark power [???] he saw nonetheless only those things which that power permitted
him to see . the knowledge which he obtained was [???] doubtless [???] often of service
to him ; yet the vision of the great might of [???] that was shown to him
fed the despair of his heart until it overthrew his mind . '
' now i understand what seemed so strange to me ! ' said [???] [???]
at his memories as he spoke . ' the lord went away from the room where
[???]
lay ; and it was only when he returned that i first thought he was changed [???]
old and broken . '
' it was in the very hour that [???] was brought to the tower that
many of us saw a strange light in the topmost chamber [???] ' said [???] . ' but
we have seen that light before [???] and it has long been rumoured in the city [???]
that the lord would at times wrestle in thought with his enemy . '
' alas ! then i have guessed rightly [???] ' said [???] . ' thus the will of
[???] entered into minas [???] ; and thus i have been delayed here . and
here i shall still be forced to remain [???] for i shall soon have other charges [???]
not [???] only .
' now i must go down to meet those who come . i have seen a sight upon
the field that is very grievous to my heart [???] and greater sorrow may yet come
to pass . come with me [???] [???] ! but you [???] [???] [???] should return to the
[???] and tell the chief of the guard there what has befallen . it will be
his duty [???] i fear [???] to withdraw you from the guard ; but say to him that [???] if i
may give him counsel [???] you should be sent to the houses of healing [???] to be the
guard and servant of your captain [???] and to be at his side when he awakes - if
that shall ever be again . for by you he was saved from the fire . go now ! i

shall return soon . '
with that he turned away and went with [???] down towards the lower
city . and even as they hastened on their way the wind brought a grey rain [???]
and all the fires sank [???] and there arose a great smoke before them .




chapter 8 . the houses of healing



a mist was in merry ' s eyes of tears and weariness when they drew near
the ruined gate of minas [???] . he gave little heed to the wreck and
slaughter that lay about all . fire and smoke and stench was in the air ; for
many engines had been burned or cast into the fire - pits [???] and many of the
slain also [???] while here and there lay many [???] of the great southron
monsters [???] half - burned [???] or broken by stone - cast [???] or shot through the eyes by
the valiant archers of [???] . the flying rain had ceased for a time [???] and
the sun gleamed up above ; but all the lower city was still wrapped in a
[???] reek .
already men were labouring to clear a way through the [???] of battle ;
and now out from the gate came some bearing litters . gently they laid [???]
upon soft pillows ; but the king ' s body they covered with a great cloth of
gold [???] and they bore torches about him [???] and their flames [???] pale in the
sunlight [???] were [???] by the wind .
so [???] and [???] came to the city of [???] [???] and all who saw them
bared their heads and bowed ; and they passed through the ash and fume of the
burned circle [???] and went on and up along the streets of stone . to merry the
ascent seemed agelong [???] a meaningless journey in a hateful dream [???] going on
and on to some dim ending that memory cannot seize .
slowly the lights of the torches in front of him [???] and went
out [???] and he was walking in a darkness ; and he thought : ' this is a tunnel
leading to a tomb ; there we shall stay forever . ' but suddenly into his dream
there fell a living voice .
' well [???] merry ! thank goodness i have found you ! '
he looked up and the mist before his eyes cleared a little . there was
[???] ! they were face to face in a narrow lane [???] and but for themselves it
was empty . he rubbed his eyes .
' where is the king ? ' he said . ' and [???] ? ' then he [???] and sat
down on a doorstep and began to weep again .
' they have gone up into the [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' i think you must
have fallen asleep on your feet and taken the wrong turning . when we found
that you were not with them [???] [???] sent me to look for you . poor old
merry ! how glad i am to see you again ! but you are worn out [???] and i won ' t

bother you with any talk . but tell me [???] are you hurt [???] or wounded ? '
' no [???] ' said merry . ' well [???] no [???] i don ' t think so . but i can ' t use my right
arm [???] [???] [???] not since i stabbed him . and my sword burned all away like a
piece of wood . '
[???] ' s face was anxious . ' well [???] you had better come with me as quick
as you can [???] ' he said . ' i wish i could carry you . you aren ' t fit to walk any
further . they shouldn ' t have let you walk at all ; but you must forgive them .
so many dreadful things have happened in the city [???] merry [???] that one poor
hobbit coming in from the battle is easily overlooked . '
' it ' s not always a misfortune being overlooked [???] ' said merry . ' i was
overlooked just now by - no [???] no [???] i can ' t speak of it . help me [???] [???] ! it ' s
all going dark again [???] and my arm is so cold . '
' lean on me [???] merry lad ! ' said [???] . ' come now ! foot by foot . it ' s not
far . '
' are you going to bury me ? ' said merry .
' no [???] indeed ! ' said [???] [???] trying to sound cheerful [???] though his heart
was wrung with fear and pity . ' no [???] we are going to the houses of healing . '
they turned out of the lane that ran between tall houses and the outer
wall of the fourth circle [???] and they regained the main street climbing up to
the [???] . step by step they went [???] while merry swayed and murmured as one
in sleep .
' i ' ll never get him there [???] ' thought [???] . ' is there no one to help
me ? i can ' t leave him here . ' just then to his surprise a boy came running up
behind [???] and as he passed he recognized [???] [???] ' s son .
' hullo [???] [???] ! ' he called . ' where are you going ? glad to see you
again [???] and still alive ! '
' i am running errands for the healers [???] ' said [???] . ' i cannot stay . '
' don ' t ! ' said [???] . ' but tell them up there that i have a sick
hobbit [???] a perian mind you [???] come from the battle - field . i don ' t think he can
walk so far . if [???] is there [???] he will be glad of the message . ' [???]
ran on .
' i ' d better wait here [???] ' thought [???] . so he let merry sink gently
down on to the pavement in a patch of sunlight [???] and then he sat down beside
him [???] laying merry ' s head in his lap . he felt his body and limbs gently [???] and
took his friend ' s hands in his own . the right hand felt icy to the touch .
it was not long before [???] himself came in search of them . he
stooped over merry and caressed his brow ; then he lifted him carefully . ' he

should have been borne in honour into this city [???] ' he said . ' he has well
repaid my trust ; for if [???] had not yielded to me [???] neither of you would
have set out ; and then far more grievous would the evils of this day have
been . ' he sighed . ' and yet here is another charge on my hands [???] while all the
time the battle hangs in the balance . '
so at last [???] and [???] and [???] were laid in beds in the
houses of healing ; and there they were tended well . for though all lore was
in these latter days fallen from its fullness of old [???] the [???] of
[???] was still wise [???] and skilled in the healing of wound and hurt [???] and all
such sickness as east of the sea mortal men were subject to . save old age
only . for that they had found no cure ; and indeed the span of their lives
had now waned to little more than that of other men [???] and those among them
who passed the tale of five score years with vigour were grown few [???] save in
some houses of purer blood . but now their art and knowledge were [???] ;
for there were many sick of a malady that would not be healed ; and they
called it the black shadow [???] for it came from the [???] . and those who were
[???] with it fell slowly into an ever deeper dream [???] and then passed to
silence and a deadly cold [???] and so died . and it seemed to the tenders of the
sick that on the halfling and on the lady of [???] this malady lay heavily .
still at whiles as the morning wore away they would speak [???] murmuring in
their dreams ; and the watchers listened to all that they said [???] hoping
perhaps to learn something that would help them to understand their hurts .
but soon they began to fall down into the darkness [???] and as the sun turned
west a grey shadow crept over their faces . but [???] burned with a fever
that would not abate .
[???] went from one to the other full of care [???] and he was told all
that the watchers could hear . and so the day passed [???] while the great battle
outside went on with shifting hopes and strange tidings ; and still [???]
waited and watched and did not go forth ; till at last the red sunset filled
all the sky [???] and the light through the windows fell on the grey faces of the
sick . then it seemed to those who stood by that in the glow the faces
[???] softly as with health returning [???] but it was only a mockery of hope .
then an old wife [???] [???] [???] the eldest of the women who served in that
house [???] looking on the fair face of [???] [???] wept [???] for all the people loved
him . and she said : ' alas ! if he should die . would that there were kings in
[???] [???] as there were once upon a time [???] they say ! for it is said in old
lore : the hands of the king are the hands of a healer . and so the rightful

king could ever be known . '
and [???] [???] who stood by [???] said : ' men may long remember your words [???]
[???] ! for there is hope in them . maybe a king has indeed returned to
[???] ; or have you not heard the strange tidings that have come to the
city ? '
' i have been too busy with this and that to heed all the crying and
shouting [???] ' she answered . ' all i hope is that those murdering devils do not
come to this house and trouble the sick . '
then [???] went out in haste [???] and already the fire in the sky was
burning out [???] and the [???] hills were fading [???] while ash - grey evening
crept over the fields .
now as the sun went down [???] and jomer and [???] drew near the
city with their captains and knights ; and when they came before the gate
[???] said :
' behold the sun setting in a great fire ! it is a sign of the end and
fall of many things [???] and a change in the tides of the world . but this city
and realm has rested in the charge of the stewards for many long years [???] and
i fear that if i enter it [???] [???] then doubt and debate may arise [???] which
should not be while this war is fought . i will not enter in [???] nor make any
claim [???] until it be seen whether we or [???] shall prevail . men shall pitch
my tents upon the field [???] and here i will [???] the welcome of the lord of
the city . '
but jomer said : ' already you have raised the banner of the kings and
displayed the tokens of [???] ' s house . will you suffer these to be
challenged ? '
' no [???] ' said [???] . ' but i deem the time [???] ; and i have no mind for
strife except with our enemy and his servants . '
and the prince [???] said . your words [???] lord [???] are wise [???] if one who is
a kinsman of the lord [???] may counsel you in this matter . he is
strong - willed and proud [???] but old ; and his mood has been strange since his
son was [???] down . yet i would not have you remain like a beggar at the
door . '
' not a beggar [???] ' said [???] . ' say a captain of the rangers [???] who are
unused to cities and houses of stone . ' and he commanded that his banner
should be furled ; and he did off the star of the north kingdom and gave it
to the keeping of the sons of [???] .
then the prince [???] and jomer of [???] left him and passed through

the city and the tumult of the people [???] and mounted to the [???] ; and they
came to the hall of the tower [???] seeking the steward . but they found his chair
empty [???] and before the dais lay [???] king of the mark upon a bed of state ;
and twelve torches stood about it [???] and twelve guards [???] knights both of [???]
and [???] . and the hangings of the bed were of green and white [???] but upon
the king was laid the great cloth of gold up to his breast [???] and upon that
his [???] sword [???] and at his feet his shield [???] the light of the torches
[???] in his white hair like sun in the spray of a fountain [???] but his
face was fair and young [???] save that a peace lay on it beyond the reach of
youth ; and it seemed that he slept .
when they had stood silent for a time beside the king [???] [???] said :
' where is the steward ? and where also is [???] ? '
and one of the guards answered : ' the steward of [???] is in the houses
of healing . '
but jomer said : ' where is the lady [???] [???] my sister ; for surely she
should be lying beside the king [???] and in no less honour ? where have they
bestowed her ? '
and [???] said : ' but the lady [???] was yet living when they bore her
hither . did you not know ? '
then hope [???] - for came so suddenly to jomer ' s heart [???] and with it
the bite of care and fear renewed [???] that he said no more [???] but turned and went
swiftly from the hall ; and the prince followed him . and when they came forth
evening had fallen and many stars were in the sky . and there came [???] on
foot and with him one cloaked in grey ; and they met before the doors of the
houses of healing . and they greeted [???] and said : ' we seek the steward [???]
and men say that he is in this house . has any hurt befallen him ? and the
lady [???] [???] where is she ? '
and [???] answered : ' she lies within and is not dead [???] but is near
death . but the lord [???] was wounded by an evil dart [???] as you have heard [???]
and he is now the steward ; for [???] has departed [???] and his house is in
ashes . ' and they were filled with grief and wonder at the tale that he told .
but [???] said : ' so victory is shorn of gladness [???] and it is bitter
bought [???] if both [???] and [???] are in one day bereft of their lords . jomer
rules the [???] . who shall rule the city meanwhile ? shall we not send now
for the lord [???] ? '
and the cloaked man spoke and said : ' he is come . ' and they saw as he
stepped into the light of the lantern by the door that it was [???] [???]

wrapped in the grey cloak of [???] above his mail [???] and bearing no other
token than the green stone of [???] . ' i have come because [???] begs
me to do so [???] ' he said . ' but for the present i am but the captain of the
d [???] nedain of [???] ; and the lord of dol amroth shall rule the city until
[???] awakes . but it is my counsel that [???] should rule us all in the
days that follow and in our dealings with the enemy . ' and they agreed upon
that .
then [???] said : ' let us not stay at the door [???] for the time is
urgent . let us enter ! for it is only in the coming of [???] that any hope
remains for the sick that lie in the house . thus spake [???] [???] wise - woman of
[???] : the hands of the king are the hands of a healer [???] and so shall the
rightful king be known . '
then [???] entered first and the others followed . and there at the
door were two guards in the livery of the cita del : one tall [???] but the other
scarce the height of a boy ; and when he saw them he cried aloud in surprise
and joy .
' strider ! how [???] ! do you know [???] i guessed it was you in the black
ships . but they were all shouting [???] and wouldn ' t listen to me . how
did you do it ? '
[???] laughed [???] and took the hobbit by the hand . ' well met indeed ! ' he
said . ' but there is not time yet for travellers ' tales . '
but [???] said to jomer : ' is it thus that we speak to our kings ? yet
maybe he will wear his crown in some other name ! '
and [???] hearing him [???] turned and said : ' verily [???] for in the high
tongue of old i am [???] [???] the [???] [???] and [???] [???] the renewer ' : and
he lifted from his breast the green stone that lay there . ' but strider shall
be the name of my house [???] if that be ever established . in the high tongue it
will not sound so ill [???] and [???] i will be and all the heirs of my
body . '
and with that they passed into the house ; and as they went towards the
rooms where the sick were tended [???] told of the deeds of [???] and
[???] . ' for [???] ' he said [???] ' long have i stood by them and at first they spoke
much in their dreaming [???] before they sank into the deadly darkness . also it
is given to me to see many things far off . '
[???] went first to [???] [???] and then to the lady [???] [???] and last to
merry . when he had looked on the faces of the sick and seen their hurts he
sighed . ' here i must put forth all such power and skill as is given to me [???] '

he said . ' would that [???] were here [???] for he is the eldest of all our race [???]
and has the greater power . '
and jomer seeing that he was sorrowful and weary said : ' first you must
rest [???] surely [???] and at the least eat a little ? '
but [???] answered : ' nay [???] for these three [???] and most soon for [???] [???]
time is running out . all speed is needed . '
then he called to [???] and he said : ' you have store in this house of
the herbs of healing ? '
' yes [???] lord [???] ' she answered ; ' but not enough [???] i reckon [???] for all that will
need them . but i am sure i do not know where we shall find more ; for all
things are amiss in these dreadful days [???] what with fires and burnings [???] and
the lads that run errands so few [???] and all the roads blocked . why [???] it is days
out of count since ever a carrier came in from [???] to the market ! but
we do our best in this house with what we have [???] as i am sure your lordship
will know . '
' i will judge that when i see [???] ' said [???] . ' one thing also is short
time for speech . have you [???] ? '
' i do not know [???] i am sure [???] lord [???] ' she answered [???] ' at least not by that
name . i will go and ask of the herb - master ; he knows all the old names . '
' it is also called [???] [???] ' said [???] ; ' and maybe you know it by
that name [???] for so the country - folk call it in these latter days . ' ' oh that ! '
said [???] . ' well [???] if your lordship had named it at first i could have told
you . no [???] we have none of it [???] i am sure . why [???] i have never heard that it had
any great virtue ; and indeed i have often said to my sisters when we came
upon it growing in the woods : [???] [???] [???] i said [???] [???] ' tis a strange name [???] and
i wonder why ' tis called so ; for if i were a king [???] i would have plants more
bright in my garden [???] . still it smells sweet when bruised [???] does it not ? if
sweet is the right word : wholesome [???] maybe [???] is nearer . '
' wholesome verily [???] ' said [???] . ' and now [???] dame [???] if you love the lord
[???] [???] run as quick as your tongue and get me [???] [???] if there is a
leaf in the city . '
' and if not [???] ' said [???] [???] ' i will ride to [???] with [???]
behind me [???] and she shall take me to the woods [???] but not to her sisters . and
[???] shall show her the meaning of haste . '
when [???] was gone [???] [???] bade the other women to make water hot .
then he took [???] ' s hand in his [???] and laid the other hand upon the sick
man ' s brow . it was drenched with sweat ; but [???] did not move or make any

sign [???] and seemed hardly to breathe .
' he is nearly spent [???] ' said [???] turning to [???] . ' but this comes
not from the wound . see ! that is healing . had he been smitten by some dart
of the [???] [???] as you thought [???] he would have died that night . this hurt was
given by some southron arrow [???] i would guess . who drew it forth ? was it
kept ? '
' i drew it forth [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and [???] the wound . but i did
not keep the arrow [???] for we had much to do . it was [???] as i remember [???] just such
a dart as the southrons use . yet i believed that it came from the shadows
above [???] for else his fever and sickness were not to be understood ; since the
wound was not deep or vital . how then do you read the matter ? '
' weariness [???] grief for his father ' s mood [???] a wound [???] and over all the
black breath [???] ' said [???] . ' he is a man of [???] will [???] for already he
had come close under the shadow before ever he rode to battle on the
out - walls . slowly the dark must have crept on him [???] even as he fought and
strove to hold his [???] . would that i could have been here sooner ! '
thereupon the herb - master enter ed . ' your lordship asked for [???] [???]
as the rustics name it [???] he said ; or [???] in the noble tongue [???] or to those
who know somewhat of the [???] . . . '
' i do so [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and i care not whether you say now [???]
[???] or [???] [???] so long as you have some . '
' your pardon lord ! ' said the man . ' i see you are a lore - master [???] not
merely a captain of war . but alas ! sir [???] we do not keep this thing in the
houses of healing [???] where only the gravely hurt or sick are tended . for it
has no virtue that we know of [???] save perhaps to sweeten a fouled air [???] or to
drive away some passing heaviness . unless [???] of course [???] you give heed to
rhymes of old days which women such as our good [???] still repeat without
understanding .
when the black breath blows
and death ' s shadow grows
and all lights pass [???]
come [???] ! come [???] !
life to the dying
in the king ' s hand lying !
it is but a [???] [???] i fear [???] garbled in the memory of old wives . its
meaning i leave to your judgement [???] if indeed it has any . but old folk still
use an infusion of the herb for [???] . '

' then in the name of the king [???] go and find some old man of less lore
and more wisdom who keeps some in his house ! ' cried [???] .
now [???] knelt beside [???] [???] and held a hand upon his brow . and
those that watched felt that some great struggle was going on . for [???] ' s
face grew grey with weariness ; and ever and anon he called the name of
[???] [???] but each time more fa intly to their hearing [???] as if [???] himself
was removed from them [???] and walked afar in some dark vale [???] calling for one
that was lost .
and at last [???] came running in [???] and he bore six leaves in a cloth .
' it is [???] [???] sir [???] ' he said ; ' but not fresh [???] i fear . it must have been
culled two weeks ago at the least . i hope it will serve [???] sir ? ' then looking
at [???] he burst into tears .
but [???] smiled . ' it will serve [???] ' he said . ' the worst is now over .
stay and be comforted ! ' then taking two leaves [???] he laid them on his hands
and breathed on them [???] and then he crushed them [???] and straightway a living
freshness filled the room [???] as if the air itself awoke and [???] [???] sparkling
with joy . and then he cast the leaves into the bowls of steaming water that
were brought to him [???] and at once all hearts were lightened . for the
fragrance that came to each was like a memory of dewy mornings of
[???]
sun in some land of which the fair world in spring is itself but a fleeting
memory . but [???] stood up as one refreshed [???] and his eyes smiled as he
held a bowl before [???] ' s dreaming face .
' well now ! who would have believed it ? ' said [???] to a woman that
stood beside her . ' the weed is better than i thought . it reminds me of the
roses of [???] [???] when i was a lass [???] and no king could ask for better . '
suddenly [???] stirred [???] and he opened his eyes [???] and he looked on
[???] who bent over him ; and a light of knowledge and love was kindled in
his eyes [???] and he spoke softly . ' my lord [???] you called me . i come . what does
the king command ? '
' walk no more in the shadows [???] but awake ! ' said [???] . ' you are weary .
rest a while [???] and take food [???] and be ready when i return . '
' i will [???] lord [???] ' said [???] . ' for who would lie idle when the king has
returned ? '
' farewell then for a while ! ' said [???] . ' i must go to others who
need me . ' and he left the chamber with [???] and [???] ; but [???] and
his son remained behind [???] unable to contain their joy . as he followed [???]

and shut the door [???] heard [???] exclaim :
' king ! did you hear that ? what did i say ? the hands of a healer [???] i
said . ' and soon the word had gone out from the house that the king was
indeed come among them [???] and after war he brought healing ; and the news ran
through the city .
but [???] came to [???] [???] and he said : ' here there is a grievous hurt
and a heavy blow . the arm that was broken has been tended with due skill [???]
and it will mend in time [???] if she ha s the strength to live : it is the
shield - arm that is [???] ; but the chief evil comes through the sword - arm .
in that there now seems no life [???] although it is [???] .
' alas ! for she was pitted against a foe beyond the strength of her mind
or body . and those who will take a weapon to such an enemy must be sterner
than steel [???] if the very shock shall not destroy them . it was an evil doom
that set her in his path . for she is a fair maiden [???] fairest lady of a house
of queens . and yet i know not how i should speak of her . when i first looked
on her and perceived her unhappiness [???] it seemed to me that i saw a white
flower standing straight and proud [???] shapely as a lily [???] and yet knew that it
was hard [???] as if wrought by elf - [???] out of steel . or was it [???] maybe [???] a
frost that had turned its sap to ice [???] and so it stood [???] bitter - sweet [???] still
fair to see [???] but [???] [???] soon to fall and die ? her malady begins far back
before this day [???] does it not [???] jomer ? '
' i marvel that you should ask me [???] lord [???] ' he answered . ' for i hold you
blameless in this matter [???] as in all else ; yet i knew not that [???] [???] my
sister [???] was touched by any frost [???] until she first looked on you . care and
dread she had [???] and shared with me [???] in the days of [???] and the king ' s
bewitchment ; and she tended the king in growing fear . but that did not bring
her to this pass ! '
' my friend [???] ' said [???] [???] ' you had horses [???] and deeds of arms [???] and the
free fields ; but she [???] born in the body of a maid [???] had a spirit and courage
at least the match of yours . yet she was doomed to wait upon an old man [???]
whom she loved as a father [???] and watch him falling into a mean dishonoured
dotage ; and her part seemed to her more [???] than that of the staff he
leaned on .
' think you that [???] had poison only for [???] ' s ears ? dotard !
what is the house of [???] but a thatched barn where [???] drink in the
reek [???] and their brats roll on the floor among their dogs ? have you not heard

those words before ? [???] spoke them [???] the teacher of [???] . though
i
do not doubt that [???] at home wrapped their meaning in terms
more
cunning . my lord [???] if your sister ' s love for you [???] and her will still bent to
her duty [???] had not restrained her lips ; you might have heard even such things
as these escape them . but who knows what she spoke to the darkness [???] alone [???]
in the bitter watches of the night [???] when all her life seemed shrinking [???] and
the walls of her bower closing in about her [???] a hutch to [???] some wild
thing in ? '
then jomer was silent [???] and looked on his sister [???] as if pondering anew
all the days of their past life together . but [???] said : ' i saw also what
you saw [???] jomer . few other griefs amid the ill chances of this world have
more bitterness and shame for a man ' s heart than to behold the love of a
lady so fair and brave that cannot be returned sorrow and pity have followed
me ever since i left her desperate in [???] and rode to the paths of the
dead ; and no fear upon that way was so present as the fear for what might
befall her . and yet [???] jomer [???] i say to you that she loves you more truly than
me ; for you she loves and knows ; but in me she loves only a shadow and a
thought : a hope of glory and great deeds [???] and lands far from the fields of
[???] .
' i have [???] maybe [???] the power to heal her body [???] and to recall her from the
dark valley . but to what she will awake : hope [???] or forgetfulness [???] or despair [???]
i do not know . and if to despair [???] then she will die [???] unless other healing
comes which i cannot bring . alas ! for her deeds have set her among the
queens of great renown . '
then [???] stooped and looked in her face [???] and it was indeed white as
a lily [???] cold as frost [???] and hard as graven stone . but he bent and kissed her
on the brow [???] and called her softly [???] saying :
' [???] jomund ' s daughter [???] awake ! for your enemy has passed away ! '
she did not stir [???] but now she began again to breathe deeply [???] so that
her breast rose and fell beneath the white linen of the sheet . once more
[???] bruised two leaves of [???] and cast them into steaming water ; and
he laved her brow with it [???] and her right arm lying cold and [???] on the
coverlet .
then [???] whether [???] had indeed some forgotten power of westernesse [???]
or whether it was but his words of the lady [???] that wrought on them [???] as

the sweet influence of the herb stole about the chamber it seemed to those
who stood by that a keen wind blew through the window [???] and it bore no scent [???]
but was an air wholly fresh and clean and young [???] as if it had not before
been breathed by any living thing and came new - made from snowy
mountains
high beneath a dome of stars [???] or from shores of silver far away washed by
seas of foam .
' awake [???] [???] [???] lady of [???] ! ' said [???] n again [???] and he took her
right hand in his and felt it warm with life returning . ' awake ! the shadow
is gone and all darkness is washed clean ! ' then he laid her hand in jomer ' s
and stepped away . ' call her ! ' he said [???] and he passed silently from the
chamber .
' [???] [???] [???] ! ' cried jomer amid his tears . but she opened her eyes and
said : ' jomer ! what joy is this ? for they said that you were slain . nay [???] but
that was only the dark voices in my dream . how long have i been dreaming ? '
' not long [???] my sister [???] ' said jomer . ' but think no more on it ! '
' i am strangely weary [???] ' she said . ' i must rest a little . but tell me [???]
what of the lord of the mark ? alas ! do not tell me that that was a dream for
i know that it was not . he is dead as he foresaw . '
' he is dead [???] ' said jomer [???] ' but he bade me say farewell to [???] dearer
than daughter . he lies now in great honour in the [???] of [???] . '
' that is grievous [???] ' she said . ' and yet it is good beyond all that i
dared hope in the dark days [???] when it seemed that the house of [???] was sunk
in honour less than any shepherd ' s cot . and what of the king ' s esquire [???] the
halfling ? jomer [???] you shall make him a knight of the [???] [???] for he is
valiant ! '
' he lies nearby in this house [???] and i will go to him [???] ' said [???] .
' jomer shall stay here for a while . but do not speak yet of war or woe [???]
until you are made whole again . great gladness it is to see you wake again
to health and hope [???] so valiant a lady ! '
' to health ? ' said [???] . ' it may be so . at least while there is an
empty saddle of some fallen rider that i can fill [???] and there are deeds to
do . but to hope ? i do not know . '
[???] and [???] came to merry ' s room [???] and there they found [???]
standing by the bed . ' poor old merry ! ' cried [???] [???] and he ran to the
bedside [???] for it seemed to him that his friend looked worse [???] and a greyness
was in his face [???] as if a weight of years of sorrow lay on him ; and suddenly

a fear seized [???] that merry would die .
' do not be afraid [???] ' said [???] . ' i came in time [???] and i have called
him back . he is weary now [???] and grieved [???] and he has taken a hurt like the
lady [???] [???] daring to smite that deadly thing . but these evils can be
amended [???] so strong and gay a sp irit is in him . his grief he will not forget ;
but it will not darken his heart [???] it will teach him wisdom . '
then [???] laid his hand on merry ' s head [???] and passing his hand gently
through the brown curls [???] he touched the eyelids [???] and called him by name . and
when the fragrance of [???] stole through the room [???] like the scent of
orchards [???] and of heather in the sunshine full of bees [???] suddenly merry awoke [???]
and he said :
' i am hungry . what is the time ? '
' past supper - time now [???] ' said [???] ; ' though i daresay i could bring
you something [???] if they will let me . '
' they will indeed [???] ' said [???] . ' and anything else that this rider of
[???] may desire [???] if it can be found in minas [???] [???] where his name is in
honour . '
' good ! ' said merry . ' then i would like supper first [???] and after that a
pipe . ' at that his face clouded . ' no [???] not a pipe . i don ' t think i ' ll smoke
again . '
' why not ? ' said [???] .
' well [???] ' answered merry slowly . ' he is dead . it has brought it all back
to me . he said he was sorry he had never had a chance of talking herb - lore
with me . almost the last thing he ever said . i shan ' t ever be able to smoke
again without thinking of him [???] and that day [???] [???] [???] when he rode up to
[???] and was so polite . '
' smoke then [???] and think of him ! ' said [???] . ' for he was a gentle
heart and a great king and kept his oaths ; and he rose out of the shadows to
a last fair morning . though your service to him was brief [???] it should be a
memory glad and honourable to the end of your days . '
merry smiled . ' well then [???] ' he said [???] ' if strider will provide what is
needed [???] i will smoke and think . i had some of [???] ' s best in my pack [???] but
what became of it in the battle [???] i am sure i don ' t know . '
' master [???] [???] ' said [???] [???] ' if you think that i have passed
through the mountains and the realm of [???] with fire and sword to bring
herbs to a careless soldier who throws away his gear [???] you are mistaken . if
your pack has not been found [???] then you must send for the herb - master of this

house . and he will tell you that he did not know that the herb you desire
had any virtues [???] but that it is called [???] by the vulgar [???] and
[???] by the noble [???] and other names in other tongues more learned [???] and
after adding a few half - forgotten rhymes that he does not understand [???] he
will [???] inform you that there is none in the house [???] and he will
leave you to reflect on the history of tongues . and so now must i . for i
have not slept in such a bed as this [???] since i rode from [???] [???] nor eaten
since the dark before dawn . '
merry seized his hand and kissed it . ' i am frightfully sorry [???] ' he said .
' go at once ! ever since that night at bree we have been a [???] to you .
but it is the way of my people to use light words at such times and say less
than they mean . we fear to say too much . it robs us of the right words when
a jest is out of place . '
' i know that well [???] or i would not deal with you in the same way ' said
[???] . ' may the shire live for ever [???] ! ' and kissing merry he went
out [???] and [???] went with him .
[???] remained behind . ' was there ever any one like him ? ' he said .
' except [???] [???] of course . i think they must be related . my dear ass [???] your
pack is lying by your bed [???] and you had it on your back when i met you . he
saw it all the time [???] of course . and anyway i have some stuff of my own . come
on now ! [???] leaf it is . fill up while i run and see about some food .
and then let ' s be easy for a bit . dear me ! we tooks and [???] [???] we
can ' t live long on the heights . '
' no [???] ' said merry . ' i can ' t . not yet [???] at any rate . but at least [???] [???] [???]
we can now see them [???] and honour them . it is best to love first what you are
fitted to love [???] i suppose : you must start somewhere and have some roots [???] and
the soil of the shire is deep . still there are things deeper and higher ; and
not a [???] could tend his garden in what he calls peace but for them [???]
whether he knows about them or not . i am glad that i know about them [???] a
little . but i don ' t know why i am talking like this . where is that leaf ? and
get my pipe out of my pack [???] if it isn ' t broken . '
[???] and [???] went now to the warden of the houses of healing [???]
and they counselled him that [???] and [???] should remain there and still
be tended with care for many days .
' the lady [???] [???] ' said [???] [???] ' will wish soon to rise and depart ; but
she should not be permitted to do so [???] if you can in any way restrain her [???]
until at least ten days be passed . '

' as for [???] [???] ' said [???] [???] ' he must soon learn that his father is
dead . but the full tale of the madness of [???] should not be told to
him [???] until he is quite healed and has duties to do . see that [???] and
the perian who were present do not speak to him of these things yet ! '
and the other perian [???] who is under my care [???] what of him ? ' said
the warden .
' it is likely that he will be fit to arise tomorrow [???] for a short
while [???] ' said [???] . ' let him do so [???] if he wishes . he may walk a little in
the care of his friends . '
' they are a remarkable race [???] ' said the warden [???] nodding his head . ' very
tough in the [???] [???] i deem . '
at the doors of the houses many were already gathered to see [???] [???]
and they followed after him ; and when at last he had supped [???] men came and
prayed that he would heal their kinsmen or their friends whose lives were in
peril through hurt or wound [???] or who lay under the black shadow . and
[???]
arose and went out [???] and he sent for the sons of [???] [???] and together they
laboured far into the night . and word went through the city : ' the king is
come again indeed . ' and they named him [???] [???] because of the green stone
that he wore [???] and so the name which it was for etold at his birth that he
should bear was chosen for him by his own people .
and when he could labour no more [???] he cast his cloak about him [???] and
slipped out of the city [???] and went to his tent just ere dawn and slept for a
little . and in the morning the banner of dol amroth [???] a white ship like a
swan upon blue water [???] floated from the tower [???] and men looked up and
wondered
if the coming of the king had been but a dream .




chapter 9 . the last debate



the morning came after the day of battle [???] and it was fair with light
clouds and the wind turning westward . legolas and [???] were early abroad [???]
and they begged leave to go up into the city ; for they were eager to see
merry and [???] .
' it is good to learn that they are still alive [???] ' said [???] ; ' for they
cost us great pains in our march over [???] [???] and i would not have such pains
all wasted . '
together the elf and the dwarf entered minas [???] [???] and folk that saw
them pass marvelled to see such companions ; for legolas was fair of face
beyond the measure of men [???] and he sang an elven - song in a clear voice as he
walked in the morning ; but [???] stalked beside him [???] stroking his beard and
staring about him .
' there is some good stone - work here [???] ' he said as he looked a t the
walls ; ' but also some that is less good [???] and the streets could be better
contrived . when [???] comes into his own [???] i shall offer him the service of
[???] of the mountain [???] and we will make this a town to be proud of . '
' they need more gardens [???] ' said legolas . ' the houses are dead [???] and there
is too little here that grows and is glad . if [???] comes into his own [???]
the people of the wood shall bring him birds that sing and trees that do not
die . '
at length they came to the prince [???] [???] and legolas looked at him
and bowed low ; for he saw that here indeed was one who had elven - blood in
his veins . ' hail [???] lord ! ' he said . ' it is long since the people of [???]
left the [???] of [???] [???] and yet still one may see that no t all sailed
from amroth ' s haven west over water . '
' so it is said in the lore of my land [???] ' said the prince ; ' yet never has
one of the fair folk been seen there for years beyond count . and i marvel to
see one here now in the midst of sorrow and war . what do you seek ? '
' i am one of the nine companions who set out with [???] from
[???] [???] said legolas and with this dwarf [???] my friend [???] i came with the lord
[???] . but now we wish to see our friends . [???] and [???] [???] who are
in your keeping [???] we are told . '
' you will find them in the houses of healing [???] and i will lead you

thither [???] ' said [???] .
' it will be enough if you send one to guide us [???] lord [???] ' said legolas .
' for [???] sends this message to you . he does not wish to enter the city
again at this time . yet there is need for the captains to hold council at
once [???] and he prays that you and jomer of [???] will come down to his tents [???]
as soon as may be . [???] is already there . '
' we will come [???] ' said [???] ; and they parted with courteous words .
' that is a fair lord and a great captain of men [???] ' said legolas . ' if
[???] has such men still in these days of fading [???] great must have been its
glory in the days of its rising . '
' and doubtless the good stone - work is the older and was wrought in the
first building [???] ' said [???] . ' it is ever so with the things that men begin :
there is a frost in spring [???] or a blight in summer [???] and they fail of their
promise . '
' yet seldom do they fail of their seed [???] ' said legolas . ' and that will
lie in the dust and rot to spring up again in times and places [???] - for .
the deeds of men will [???] us [???] [???] . '
' and yet come to naught in the end but might - have - beens [???] i guess [???] ' said
the dwarf .
' to that the elves know not the answer [???] ' said legolas .
with that the servant of the prince came and led them to the houses of
healing ; and there they found their friends in the garden [???] and their meeting
was a merry one . for a while they walked and talked [???] rejoicing for a brief
space in peace and rest under the morning high up in the windy circles of
the city . then when merry became weary [???] they went and sat upon the wall
with
the [???] of the houses of healing behind them ; and away southward
before them was the [???] glittering in the sun [???] as it flowed away [???] out of
the sight even of legolas [???] into the wide flats and green haze of [???]
and south [???] .
and now legolas fell silent [???] while the others talked [???] and he looked out
against the sun [???] and as he gazed he saw white sea - birds beating up the
river .
' look ! ' he cried . ' gulls ! they are flying far inland . a wonder they are
to me and a trouble to my heart . never in all my life had i met them [???] until
we came to [???] [???] and there i heard them crying in the air as we rode to
the battle of the ships . then i stood still [???] forgetting war in middle - earth ;

for their wailing voices spoke to me of the sea . the sea ! alas ! i have not
yet beheld it . but deep in the hearts of a ll my kindred lies the
sea - longing [???] which it is perilous to stir . alas ! for the gulls . no peace
shall i have again under beech or under elm . '
' say not so ! ' said [???] . ' there are countless things still to see in
middle - earth [???] and great works to do . but if all the fair folk take to the
havens [???] it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay . '
' dull and dreary indeed ! ' said merry : ' you must not go to the havens [???]
legolas . there will always be some folk [???] big or little [???] and even a few wise
[???] like [???] [???] who need you . at least i hope so . though i feel somehow
that the worst of this war is still to come . how i wish it was all over [???] and
well over ! '
' don ' t be so gloomy ! ' cried [???] . ' the sun is shining [???] and here we
are together for a day or two at least . i want to hear more about you all .
come [???] [???] ! you and legolas have mentioned your strange journey with
strider about a dozen times already this morning . but you haven ' t told me
anything about it . '
' the sun may shine here [???] ' said [???] [???] ' but there are memories of that
road that i do not wish to recall out of the darkness . had i known what was
before me [???] i think that not for any friendship would i have taken the paths
of the dead . '
' the paths of the dead ? ' said [???] . ' i heard [???] say that and i
wondered what he could mean . won ' t you tell us some more ? '
' not willingly [???] ' said [???] . ' for upon that road i was put to shame :
[???] [???] ' s son [???] who had deemed himself more tough than men [???] and
hardier
under earth than any elf . but neither did i prove ; and i was held to the
road only by the will of [???] . '
' and by the love of him also [???] ' said legolas . ' for all those who come to
know him come to love him after his own fashion [???] even the cold maiden of the
[???] . it was at early morn of the day ere you came there [???] merry [???] that we
left [???] [???] and such a fear was on all the folk that none would look on
our going [???] save the lady [???] [???] who lies now hurt in the house below . there
was grief at that parting [???] and i was grieved to behold it . '
' alas ! i had heart only for myself [???] ' said [???] . ' nay ! i will not speak
of that journey . '
he fell silent ; but [???] and merry were so eager for news that at

last legolas said : ' i will tell you enough for your peace ; for i felt not
the horror [???] and i feared not the shadows of men [???] powerless and frail as i
deemed them . '
swiftly then he told of the haunted road under the mountains [???] and the
dark tryst at erech [???] and the gr eat ride thence [???] ninety leagues and three [???] to
[???] on [???] . ' four days and nights [???] and on into a fifth [???] we rode from
the black stone [???] ' he said . ' and lo ! in the darkness of [???] my hope rose ;
for in that gloom the shadow host seemed to grow stronger and more terrible
to look upon . some i saw riding [???] some striding [???] yet all moving with the same
great speed . silent they were [???] but there was a gleam in their eyes . in the
[???] of [???] they overtook our horses [???] and swept round us [???] and would
have passed us by [???] if [???] had not forbidden them .
' at his command they fell back . [???] even the shades of men are obedient to
his will [???] [???] i thought . [???] they may serve his needs yet ! [???]
' one day of light we rode [???] and then came the day without dawn [???] a nd
still we rode on [???] and [???] and [???] we crossed ; and on the third day we
came to [???] above the mouth of [???] . and there men of [???]
contested the fords with fell folk of [???] and harad who had sailed up the
river . but defenders and foes alike gave up the battle and fled when we
came [???] crying out that the king of the dead was upon them . only [???] [???] lord
of [???] [???] had the heart to abide us ; and [???] bade him gather his folk
and come behind [???] if they dared [???] when the grey host had passed .
' [???] at [???] the heir of [???] will have need of you [???] [???] he said .
' thus we crossed over [???] [???] driving the allies of [???] in rout
before us ; and then we rested a while . but soon [???] arose [???] saying : [???] lo !
already mina s [???] is assailed . i fear that it will fall ere we come to
its aid . [???] so we mounted again before night had passed and went on with all
the speed that our horses could endure over the plains of [???] . '
legolas paused and sighed [???] and turning his eyes southward softly he
sang :
silver flow the streams from celos to [???]
in the green fields of [???] !
tall grows the grass there . in the wind from the sea
the white lilies sway [???]
and the golden bells are shaken of [???] and [???]
in the green fields of [???] [???]
in the wind from the sea !

' green are those fields in the songs of my people ; but they were dark
then [???] grey wastes in the blackness before us . and over the wide land [???]
trampling [???] the grass and the flowers [???] we hunted our foes through a
day and a night [???] until we came at the bitter end to the great river at last .
' then i thought in my heart that we drew near to the sea ; for wide was
the water in the darkness [???] and sea - birds [???] cried on its [???] shores .
alas for the wailing of the gulls ! did not the lady tell me to beware of
them ? and now i cannot forget them . '
' for my part i heeded them not [???] ' said [???] ; ' for we came then at last
upon battle in earnest . there at [???] lay the main fleet of [???] [???] fifty
great ships and smaller vessels beyond count . many of those that we pursued
had reached the havens before us [???] and brought their fear with them ; and some
of the ships had put off [???] seeking to escape down the river or to reach the
far shore ; and many of the smaller craft were [???] . but the [???] [???]
being now driven to the brink [???] turned at bay [???] and they were fierce in
despair ; and they laughed when they looked on us [???] for they were a great army
still .
' but [???] halted and cried with a great voice : [???] now come ! by the
black stone i call you ! [???] and suddenly the shadow host that had hung back at
the last came up like a grey tide [???] sweeping all away before it . faint cries
i heard [???] and dim horns b lowing [???] and a murmur as of countless far voices : it
was like the echo of some forgotten battle in the dark years long ago . pale
swords were drawn ; but i know not whether their blades would still bite [???] for
the dead needed no longer any weapon but fear . none would withstand them .
' to every ship they came that was drawn up [???] and then they passed over
the water to those that were anchored ; and all the [???] were filled with
a madness of terror and leaped overboard [???] save the slaves chained to the
oars . reckless we rode among our [???] foes [???] driving them like leaves [???]
until we came to the shore . and then to each of the great ships that
remained [???] sent one of the d [???] nedain [???] and they comforted the captives
that were aboard [???] and bade them put aside fear and be free .
' ere that dark day ended none of the enemy were left to resist us all
were drowned [???] or were flying south in the hope to find their own lands upon
foot . strange and wonderful i thought it that the designs of [???] should
be overthrown by such [???] of fear and darkness . with its own weapons was
it worsted ! '
' strange indeed [???] ' said legolas . ' in that hour i looked on [???] and

thought how great and terrible a lord he might have become in the strength
of his will [???] had he taken the ring to himself . not for naught does [???]
fear him . but nobler is his spirit than the understanding of [???] ; for is
he not of the children of l [???] thien ? never shall that line fail [???] though the
years may lengthen beyond count . '
' beyond the eyes of the [???] are such [???] [???] ' said [???] .
' but mighty indeed was [???] that day . lo ! all the black fleet was in his
hands ; and he chose the greatest ship to be his own [???] and he went up into it .
then he let sound a great concourse of trumpets taken from the enemy ; and
the shadow host withdrew to the shore . there they stood silent [???] hardly to be
seen [???] save for a red gleam in their eyes that caught the glare of the ships
that were burning . and [???] spoke in a loud voice to the dead men [???]
crying :
' [???] hear now the words of the heir of [???] ! your oath is fulfilled .
go back and trouble not the [???] ever again ! depart and be at rest ! [???]
' and thereupon the king of the dead stood out before the host and broke
his spear and cast it down . then he bowed low and turned away ; and swiftly
the whole grey host drew off and vanished like a mist that is driven back by
a sudden wind ; and it seemed to me that i awoke from a dream .
' that night we rested while others laboured . for there were many
captives set free [???] and many slaves released who had been folk of [???]
taken in raids ; and soon also there was a great gathering of men out of
[???] and the [???] [???] and [???] of [???] came u p with all the
horsemen
that he could muster . now that the fear of the dead was removed they came to
aid us and to look on the heir of [???] ; for the rumour of that name had
run like fire in the dark .
' and that is near the end of our tale . for during that evening and
night many ships were made ready and manned ; and in the morning the fleet
set forth . long past it now seems [???] yet it was but the morn of the day ere
yesterday [???] the sixth since we rode from [???] . but still [???] was
driven by fear that time was too short .
' [???] it is forty leagues and two from [???] to the landings at the
[???] [???] [???] he said . [???] yet to the [???] we must come tomorrow or fail
utterly . [???]
' the oars were now [???] by free men [???] and manfully they laboured ; yet
slowly we passed up the great river [???] for we strove against its stream [???] and

though that is not swift down in the south [???] we had no help of wind . heavy
would my heart have been [???] for all our victory at the havens [???] if legolas had
not laughed suddenly .
' [???] up with your beard [???] durin ' s son ! [???] he said . [???] for thus is it spoken :
oft hope is born [???] when all is forlorn . [???] but what hope he saw from afar he
would not tell . when night came it did but deepen the darkness [???] and our
hearts were hot [???] for away in the north we saw a red glow under the cloud [???]
and [???] said : [???] minas [???] is burning . [???]
' but at midnight hope was indeed born anew . sea - crafty men of the [???]
gazing southward spoke of a change coming with a fresh wind from the sea .
long ere day the masted ships hoisted sail ; and our speed grew [???] until dawn
whitened the foam at our prows . and so it was [???] as you know [???] that we came in
the third hour of the morning with a fair wind and the sun [???] [???] and we
[???] the great standard in battle . it was a great day and a great hour [???]
whatever may come after . '
' follow what may [???] great deeds are not lessened in worth [???] ' said legolas .
' great deed was the riding of the paths of the dead [???] and great it shall
remain [???] though none be left in [???] to sing of it in the days that are to
come . '
' and that may well befall [???] ' said [???] . ' for the faces of [???] and
[???] are grave . much i wonder what counsels they are taking in the tents
there below . for my part [???] like merry [???] i wish that with our victory the war
was now over . yet whatever is still to do [???] i hope to have a part in it [???] for
the honour of the folk of the lonely mountain . '
' and i for the folk of the great wood [???] ' said legolas [???] ' and for the love
of the lord of the white tree . '
then the companions fell silent [???] but a while they sat there in the high
place [???] each busy with his own thoughts [???] while the captains debated .
when the prince [???] had parted from legolas and [???] [???] at once he
sent for jomer ; and he went down with him from the city [???] and they came to
the tents of [???] that were set up on the field not far from the place
where king [???] had fallen . and there they took counsel together with
[???] and [???] and the sons of [???] .
' my lords [???] ' said [???] [???] ' listen to the words of the steward of [???]
before he died : you may triumph on the fields of the [???] for a day [???] but
against the power that has now arisen there is no victory . i do not bid you
despair [???] as he did [???] but to ponder the truth in these words .

' the stones of seeing do not lie [???] and not even the lord of barad - dyr
can make them do so . he can [???] maybe [???] by his will choose what things shall be
seen by weaker minds [???] or cause them to mistake the meaning of what they see .
nonetheless it cannot be doubted that when [???] saw great forces arrayed
against him in [???] [???] and more still being gathered [???] he saw that which
truly is .
' hardly has our strength sufficed to beat off the first grea t assault .
the next will be greater . this war then is without final hope [???] as [???]
perceived . victory cannot be achieved by arms [???] whether you sit here to
endure siege after siege [???] or march out to be overwhelmed beyond the river .
you have only a choice of evils ; and [???] would counsel you to
strengthen such strong places as you have [???] and there [???] the onset ; for so
shall the time before your end be made a little longer . '
' then you would have us retreat to minas [???] [???] or dol amroth [???] or to
[???] [???] and there sit like children on sand - castles when the tide is
flowing ? ' said [???] .
' that would be no new counsel [???] ' said [???] . ' have you not done this
and little more in all the days of [???] ? but no ! i sa id this would be
[???] . i do not counsel [???] . i said victory could not be achieved by
arms . i still hope for victory [???] but not by arms . for into the midst of all
these [???] comes the ring of power [???] the foundation of barad - dyr [???] and the
hope of [???] .
' concerning this thing [???] my lords [???] you now all know enough for the
understanding of our plight [???] and of [???] ' s . if he regains it [???] your valour
is vain [???] and his victory will be swift and complete : so complete that none
can foresee the end of it while this world lasts . if it is destroyed [???] then
he will fall ; and his fall will be so low that none can foresee his arising
ever again . for he will lose the best part of the strength that was native
to him in his beginning [???] and all that was made or begun with that power will
crumble [???] and he will be [???] for ever [???] becoming a mere spirit of malice
that gnaws itself in the shadows [???] but cannot again grow or take shape . and
so a great evil of this world will be removed .
' other evils there are that may come ; for [???] is himself but a
servant or [???] . yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the
world [???] but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are
set [???] [???] the evil in the fields that we know [???] so that those who live
after may have clean earth to till . what weather they shall have is not ours

to rule .
' now [???] knows all this [???] and he knows that this precious thing which
he lost has been found again ; but he does not yet know where it is [???] or so we
hope . and therefore he is now in great doubt . for if we have found this
thing [???] there are some among us with strength enough to wield it . that too he
knows . for do i not guess rightly [???] [???] [???] that you have shown yourself to
him in the stone of orthanc ? '
' i did so ere i rode from the [???] [???] ' answered [???] . ' i deemed
that the time was ripe [???] and that the stone had come to me for just such a
purpose . it was then ten days since the ring - bearer went east from [???] [???]
and the eye of [???] [???] i thought [???] should be drawn out from his own land . too
seldom has he been challenged since he returned to his tower . though if i
had foreseen how swift would be his onset in answer [???] maybe i should not have
dared to show myself . bare time was given me to come to your aid . '
' but how is this ? ' asked jomer . ' all is vain [???] you say [???] if he has the
ring . why should he think it not vain to assail us [???] if we have it ? '
' he is not yet sure [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and he has not built up his power
by waiting until his enemies are secure [???] as we have done . also we could not
learn how to wield the full power all in a day . indeed it can be used only
by one master alone [???] not by many ; and he will look for a time of strife [???] ere
one of the great among us makes himself master and puts down the others . in
that time the ring might aid him [???] if he were sudden .
' he is watching . he sees much and hears much . his [???] are still
abroad . they passed over this field ere the [???] [???] though few of the weary
and sleeping were aware of them . he studies the signs : the sword that robbed
him of his treasure re - made ; the winds of fortune turning in our favour [???] and
the defeat [???] - for of his first assault the fall of his great captain .
' his doubt will be growing [???] even as we speak here . his eye is now
straining towards us [???] blind almost to all else that is moving . so we must
keep it . therein lies all our hope . this [???] then [???] is my counsel . we have not
the ring . in wisdom or great folly it has been sent away to be destroyed [???]
lest it destroy us . without it we cannot by force defeat his force . but we
must at all costs keep his eye from his true peril . we cannot achieve
victory by arms [???] but by arms we can give the ring - bearer his only chance [???]
frail though it be .
' as [???] has begun [???] so we must go on . we must push [???] to his
last throw . we must call out his hidden strength [???] so that he shall empty his

land . we must march out to meet him at once . we must make ourselves the
bait [???] though his jaws should close on us . he will take that bait [???] in hope
and in greed [???] for he will think that in such rashness he sees the pride of
the new ringlord : and he will say : [???] so ! he pushes out his neck too soon and
too far . let him come on [???] and behold i will have him in a trap from which he
cannot escape . there i will crush him [???] and what he has taken in his
insolence shall be mine again for ever . [???]
' we must walk open - eyed into that trap [???] with courage [???] but small hope
for ourselves . for [???] my lords [???] it may well prove that we ourselves shall
perish utterly in a black battle far from the living lands ; so that even if
barad - dyr be thrown down [???] we shall not live to see a new age . but this [???] i
deem [???] is our duty . and better so than to perish nonetheless - as we surely
shall [???] if we sit here - and know as we die that no new age shall be . '
they were silent for a while . at length [???] spoke . ' as i have
begun [???] so i will go on . we come now to the very brink [???] where hope and
despair are akin . to waver is to fall . let none now reject the counsels of
[???] [???] whose long labours against [???] come at last to their test . but
for him all would long ago have been lost . nonetheless i do not yet claim to
command any man . let others choose as they will . '
then said [???] : ' from the north we came with this purpose [???] and from
[???] our father we brought this very counsel . we will not turn back . '
' as for myself [???] ' said jomer [???] ' i have little knowledge of these deep
matters ; but i need it not . this i know [???] and it is enough [???] that as my friend
[???] succoured me and my people [???] so i will aid him when he calls . i will
go . '
' as for me [???] ' said [???] [???] ' the lord [???] i hold to be my
liege - lord [???] whether he claim it or no . his wish is to me a command . i will
go also . yet for a while i stand in the place of the steward of [???] [???] and
it is mine to think first of its people . to [???] some heed must still be
given . for we must prepare against all chances [???] good as well as evil . now [???]
it may be that we shall triumph [???] and while there is any hope of this [???] [???]
must be protected . i would not have us return with victory to a city in
ruins and a land ravaged behind us . and yet we learn from the [???] that
there is an army still unfought upon our northern flank . '
' that is true [???] ' said [???] . ' i do not counsel you to leave the city
all unmanned . indeed the force that we lead east need not be great enough
for any assault in earnest upon [???] [???] so long as it be great enough to

challenge battle . and it must move soon . therefore i ask the captains : what
force could we muster and lead out in two days ' time at the latest ? and they
must be hardy men that go willingly [???] knowing their peril . '
' all are weary [???] and very many have wounds light or grievous [???] ' said
jomer [???] ' and we have suffered much loss of our horses [???] and that is ill to
bear . if we must ride soon [???] then i cannot hope to lead even two thousands [???]
and yet leave as ma ny for the defence of the city . '
' we have not only to reckon with those who fought on this field ' said
[???] . ' new strength is on the way from the southern [???] [???] now that the
coasts have been rid . four thousands i sent marching from [???] through
[???] two days ago ; and [???] the fearless rides before them . if we
set out in two days more [???] they will draw nigh ere we depart . moreover many
were bidden to follow me up the river in any craft they could gather ; and
with this wind they will soon be at hand [???] indeed several ships have already
come to the [???] . i judge that we could lead out seven thousands of horse
and foot [???] and yet leave the city in better defence than it was when the
assault began . '
' the gate is destroyed [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and where now is the skill to
rebuild it and set it up anew ? '
' in [???] in the kingdom of [???] there is such skill [???] ' said [???] ;
' and if all our hopes do not perish [???] then in time i will send [???] [???] ' s
son to ask for [???] of the mountain . but men are better than gates [???] and
no gate will endure against our enemy if men desert it . '
this then was the end of the debate of the lords : that they should set
forth on the second morning from that day with seven thousands [???] if these
might be found ; and the great part of this force should be on foot [???] because
of the evil lands into which they would go . [???] should find some two
thousands of those that he had gathered to him in the south ; but [???]
should find three and a half thousands ; and jomer five hundreds of the
[???] who were [???] but themselves [???] [???] and he himself
should
lead five hundreds of his best riders on horse ; and another company of five
hundred horse there should be [???] among which should ride the sons of [???]
with the d [???] nedain and the knights of dol amroth : all told six thousand foot
and a thousand horse . but the main strength of the [???] that remained
horsed and able to fight [???] some three thousand under the command of [???] [???]
should waylay the west road against the enemy that was in [???] . and at

once swift riders were sent out to gather what news they could northwards ;
and eastwards from [???] and the road to minas [???] .
and when they had reck oned up all their strength and taken thought for
the journeys they should make and the roads they should choose [???] [???]
suddenly laughed aloud .
' surely [???] ' he cried [???] ' this is the greatest jest in all the history of
[???] : that we should ride with seven thousands [???] scarce as many as the
[???] of its army in the days of its power [???] to assail the mountains and
the [???] gate of the black land ! so might a child threaten a
mail - clad knight with a bow of string and green willow ! if the dark lord
knows so much as you say [???] [???] [???] will he not rather smile than fear [???]
and with his little finger crush us like a fly that tries to sting him ? '
' no [???] he will try to trap the fly and take the sting [???] ' said [???] .
' and there are names among us that are worth more than a thousand mail - clad
knights apiece . no [???] he will not smile . '
' neither shall we [???] ' said [???] . ' if this be jest [???] then it is too
bitter for laughter . nay [???] it is the last move in a great [???] [???] and for
one side or the other it will bring the end of the game . ' then he drew
and [???] ril and held it up glittering in the sun . ' you shall not be sheathed
again until the last battle is fought ; ' he said .




chapter 10 . the black gate opens



two days later the army of the west was all assembled on the [???] .
the host of [???] and [???] had turned back out of [???] [???] but harried
and scattered by the [???] they had broken and fled with little fighting
towards cair andros ; and with that threat destroyed and new strength
arriving out of the south the city was as well manned as might be . scouts
reported that no enemies remained upon the roads east as far as the
cross - roads of the fallen king . all now was ready for the last throw .
legolas and [???] were to ride again together in the company of [???]
and [???] [???] who went in the van with the d [???] nedain and the sons of [???] .
but merry to his shame was not to go with them .
' you are not fit for such a journey [???] ' said [???] . ' but do not be
ashamed . if you do no more in this war [???] you have already earned great
honour . [???] shall go and represent the [???] ; and do not grudge him
his chance of peril [???] for though he has done as well as his fortune allowed
him [???] he has yet to match your deed . but in truth all now are in like danger .
though it may be our part to find bitter end before the gate of [???] [???] if
we do so [???] then you will come also to a last stand [???] either here or wherever
the black tide overtakes you . farewell ! '
and so [???] merry now stood and watched the mustering of the
army . [???] was with him [???] and he also was downcast ; for his father was to
march leading a company of the men of the city : he could not rejoin the
guard until his case was judged . in that same company [???] was also to go [???]
as a soldier of [???] . merry could see him not far off [???] a small but upright
figure among the tall men of minas [???] .
at last the trumpets rang and the army began to move . troop by troop [???]
and company by company [???] they wheeled and went off eastward . and long
after
they had passed away out of sight down the great road to the causeway [???] merry
stood there . the last glint of the morning sun on spear and helm [???]
and was lost [???] and still he remained with bowed head and heavy heart [???] feeling
friendless and alone . everyone that he cared for had gone away into the
gloom that hung over the distant eastern sky ; and little hope at all was
left in his heart that he wou ld ever see any of them again .

as if recalled by his mood of despair [???] the pain in his arm returned [???]
and he felt weak and old [???] and the sunlight seemed thin . he was roused by the
touch of [???] ' s hand .
' come [???] master perian ! ' said the lad . ' you are still in pain [???] i see . i
will help you back to the healers . but do not fear ! they will come back . the
men of minas [???] will never be overcome . and now they have the lord
[???] [???] and [???] of the guard too . '
ere noon the army came to [???] . there all the workers and
[???] that could be spared were busy . some were strengthening the
ferries and boat - bridges that the enemy had made and in part destroyed when
they fled ; some gathered stores and booty ; and others on the eastern side
across the river were throwing up hasty works of defence .
the [???] passed on through the ruins of old [???] [???] and over the
wide river [???] and on up the long straight road that in the high days had been
made to run from the fair tower of the sun to the tall tower of the moon [???]
which now was minas [???] in its accursed vale . five miles beyond [???]
they halted [???] ending their first day ' s march .
but the horsemen pressed on and ere evening they came to the
cross - roads and the great ring of trees [???] and all was silent . no sign of any
enemy had they seen [???] no cry or call had been heard [???] no shaft had sped from
rock or thicket by the way [???] yet ever as they went forward they felt the
watchfulness of the land increase . tree and stone [???] blade and leaf were
listening . the darkness had been [???] [???] and far away westward sunset was
on the vale of [???] [???] and the white peaks of the mountains blushed in the
blue air ; but a shadow and a gloom brooded upon the [???] d [???] ath .
then [???] set trumpeters at each of the four roads that ran into the
ring of trees [???] and they blew a great [???] [???] and the heralds cried aloud :
' the lords of [???] have returned and all this land that is theirs they
take back . ' the hideous orc - head that was set upon the carven figure was
cast down and broken in pieces [???] and the old king ' s head was raised and set
in its place once more [???] still crowned with white and golden flowers : and men
laboured to wash and pare away all the foul [???] that [???] had put upon
the stone .
now in their debate some had counselled that minas [???] should first
be assailed [???] and if they might take it [???] it should be utterly destroyed .
' and [???] maybe [???] ' said [???] [???] ' the road that leads thence to the pass above
will prove an easier way of assault upon the dark lord than his northern

gate . '
but against this [???] had spoken urgently [???] because of the evil that
dwelt in the valley [???] where the minds of living men would turn to madness and
horror [???] and because also of the news that [???] had brought . for if the
ring - bearer had indeed attempted that way [???] then above all they should not
draw the eye of [???] thither . so the next day when the main host came up [???]
they set a strong guard upon the cross - roads to make some defence [???] if [???]
should send a force over the [???] pass [???] or should bring more men up from
the south . for that guard they chose mostly archers who knew the ways of
[???] and would lie hid in the woods and [???] about the meeting of the
ways . but [???] and [???] rode with the [???] to the entrance of
[???] vale and looked on the evil city .
it was dark and lifeless ; for the [???] and lesser creatures of [???]
that had dwelt there had been destroyed in battle [???] and the [???] were
abroad . yet the air of the valley was heavy with fear and enmity . then they
broke the evil bridge and set red flames in the noisome fields and departed .
the day after [???] being the third day since they set out from minas
[???] [???] the army began its northward march along the road . it was some
hundred miles by that way from the cross - roads to the [???] [???] and what
might befall them before they came so far none knew they went openly but
heedfully [???] with mounted scouts before them on the road [???] and others on foot
upon either side [???] especially on the eastward flank ; for there lay dark
thickets [???] and a tumbled land of rocky [???] and crags [???] behind which the
long grim [???] of the [???] d [???] ath [???] up . the weather of the world
remained fair and the wind held in the west [???] but nothing could waft away the
[???] and the sad mists that clung about the mountains of shadow ; and
behind them at whiles great smokes would arise and hover in the upper winds .
ever and anon [???] let blow the trumpets [???] and the heralds would cry :
[???] the lords of [???] are come ! let all leave this land or yield them up ! '
but [???] said : ' say not the lords of [???] . say the king [???] . for
that is true [???] even though he has not yet sat upon the throne ; and it will
give the enemy more thought [???] if the heralds use that name . ' and thereafter
thrice a day the heralds proclaimed the coming of the king [???] . but none
answered the challenge .
nonetheless [???] though they marched in seeming peace [???] the hearts of all
the army [???] from the highest to the lowest [???] were downcast [???] and with every mile
that they went north [???] of evil grew heavier on them . it was near

the end of the second day of their march from the cross - roads that they
first met any offer of battle . for a strong force of [???] and [???]
attempted to take their leading companies in an ambush ; and that was in the
very place where [???] had [???] the men of harad [???] and the road went in
a deep cutting through an out - thrust of the eastward hills . but the captains
of the west were well warned by their scouts [???] skilled men from [???]
annyn
led by [???] ; and so the ambush was itself trapped . for horsemen went
wide
about westward and came up on the flank of the enemy and from behind [???] and
they were destroyed or driven east into the hills .
but the victory did little to [???] the captains . ' it is but a
feint [???] ' said [???] ; ' and its chief purpose [???] i deem [???] was rather to draw us
on by a false guess of our enemy ' s weakness than to do us much hurt [???] yet . '
and from that evening onward the [???] came and followed every move of
the
army . they still flew high and out of sight of all save legolas [???] and yet
their presence could be felt [???] as a deepening of shadow and a dimming of the
sun ; and though the [???] did not yet stoop low upon their foes and
were silent [???] uttering no cry [???] the dread of them could not be shaken off .
so time and the hopeless journey wore away . upon the fourth day from
the cross - roads and the sixth from minas [???] they came at last to the end
of the living lands [???] and began to pass into the desolation that lay before
the gates of the pass of [???] [???] ; and they could descry the marshes
and the desert that stretched north and west to the emyn muil . so desolate
were those places and so deep the horror that lay on them that some of the
host were unmanned [???] and they could neither walk nor ride further north .
[???] looked at them [???] and there was pity in his eyes rather than
wrath ; for these were young men from [???] [???] from westfold far away [???] or
husbandmen from [???] [???] and to them [???] had been from childhood
a
name of evil [???] and yet unreal [???] a legend that had no part in their simple
life ; and now they walked like men in a hideous dream made true [???] and they
understood not this war nor why fate should lead them to such a pass .
' go ! ' said [???] . ' but keep what honour you may [???] and do not run ! and
there is a task which you may attempt and so be not wholly shamed . take your
way south - west till you come to cair andros [???] and if that is still held by

enemies [???] as i think [???] then re - take it [???] if you can ; and hold it to the last in
defence of [???] and [???] ! '
then some being shamed by his mercy overcame their fear and went on [???]
and the others took new hope [???] hearing of a manful deed within their measure
that they could turn to [???] and they departed . and so [???] since many men had
already been left at the cross - roads [???] it was with less than six thousands
that the captains of the west came at last to challenge the black gate and
the might of [???] .
they advanced now slowly [???] expecting at every hour some answer to their
challenge [???] and they drew together [???] since it was but waste of men to send out
scouts or small parties from the main host . at nightfall of the fifth day of
the march from [???] vale they made their last camp [???] and set fires about it
of such dead wood and heath as they could find . they passed the hours of
night in wakefulness and they were aware of many things half - seen that
walked and [???] all about them [???] and they heard the howling of wolves . the
wind had died and all the air seemed still . they could see little [???] for
though it was cloudless and the waxing moon was four nights old [???] there were
smokes and fumes that rose out of the earth and the white [???] was
shrouded in the mists of [???] .
it grew cold . as morning came the wind bega n to stir again [???] but now it
came from the north [???] and soon it freshened to a rising breeze . all the
night - walkers were gone [???] and the land seemed empty . north amid their
noisome
pits lay the first of the great heaps and hills of slag and broken rock and
blasted earth [???] the vomit of the [???] - folk of [???] ; but south and now
near loomed the great rampart of [???] [???] [???] and the black gate [???] [???]
and the two towers of the teeth tall and dark upon either side . for in their
last march the capta ins had turned away from the old road as it bent east [???]
and avoided the peril of the lurking hills [???] and so now they were approaching
the [???] from the north - west [???] even as [???] had done .
the two vast iron doors of the black gate under its frowning arch were
fast closed . upon the battlement nothing could be seen . all was silent but
watchful . they were come to the last end of their folly [???] and stood forlorn
and chill in the grey light of early day before towers and walls which their
army could not assault with hope [???] not even if it had brought thither engines
of great power [???] and the enemy had no more force than would suffice for the
manning of the gate and wall alone . yet they knew that all the hills and

rocks about the [???] were filled with hidden foes [???] and the shadowy
defile beyond was bored and [???] by teeming broods of evil things . and
as they stood they saw all the [???] gathered together [???] hovering above the
towers of the teeth like [???] ; and they knew that they were watched . but
still the enemy made no sign .
no choice was left them but to play their part to its end . therefore
[???] now set the host in such array as could best be contrived ; and they
were drawn up on two great hills of blasted stone and earth that [???] had
piled in years of labour . before them towards [???] lay like a moat a great
mire of reeking mud and foul - smelling [???] . when all was ordered [???] the
captains rode forth towards the black gate with a great guard of horsemen
and the banner and heralds and trumpeters . there was [???] as chief
herald [???] and [???] with the sons of [???] [???] and jomer of [???] [???] and
[???] ; and legolas and [???] and [???] were bidden to go also [???] so that
all the enemies of [???] should have a witness .
they came within cry of the [???] [???] and [???] the banner [???] and blew
upon their trumpets ; and the heralds stood out and sent their voices up over
the battlement of [???] .
' come forth ! ' they cried . ' let the lord of the black land come forth !
justice shall be done upon him . for wrongfully he has made war upon [???]
and wrested its lands . therefore the king of [???] demands that he should
atone for his evils [???] and depart then for ever . come forth ! '
there was a long silence [???] and from wall and gate no cry or sound was
heard in answer . but [???] had already laid his plans [???] and he had a mind
first to play these mice cruelly before he struck to kill . so it was that [???]
even as the captains were about to turn away [???] the silence was broken
suddenly . there came a long rolling of great drums like thunder in the
mountains [???] and then a braying of horns that shook the very stones and
[???] men ' s ears . and thereupon the middle door of the black gate was
thrown open with a great clang [???] and out of it there came an embassy from the
dark tower .
at its head there rode a tall and evil shape [???] mounted upon a black
horse [???] if horse it was ; for it was huge and hideous [???] and its face was a
frightful mask [???] more like a skull than a living head [???] and in the [???] of
its eyes and in its [???] there burned a flame . the rider was robed all
in black [???] and black was his lofty helm ; yet this was no [???] but a
living man . the lieutenant of the tower of barad - dyr he was [???] and his name is

remembered in no tale ; for he himself had forgotten it [???] and he said : ' i am
the mouth of [???] . ' but it is told that he was a [???] [???] who came of the
race of those that are named the black n [???] [???] ; for they established
their dwellings in middle - earth during the years of [???] ' s domination [???] and
they worshipped him [???] being [???] of evil knowledge . and he entered the
service of the dark tower when it first rose again [???] and because of his
cunning he grew ever higher in the lord ' s favour ; and he learned great
[???] [???] and knew much of the mind of [???] ; and he was more cruel than
any
orc .
he it was that now rode out [???] and with him came only a small company of
black - [???] soldiery [???] a nd a single banner [???] black but bearing on it in
red the evil eye . now halting a few paces before the captains of the west he
looked them up and down and laughed .
' is there anyone in this rout with authority to treat with me ? ' he
asked . ' or indeed with wit to understand me ? not thou at least ! ' he mocked [???]
turning to [???] with scorn . ' it needs more to make a king than a piece of
elvish glass [???] or a rabble such as this . why [???] any [???] of the hills can
show as good a following ! '
[???] said naught in answer [???] but he took the other ' s eye and held it [???]
and for a moment they strove thus ; but soon [???] though [???] did not stir nor
move hand to weapon [???] the other [???] and gave back as if menaced with a
blow . ' i am a herald and ambassador [???] a nd may not be assailed ! ' he cried .
' where such laws hold [???] ' said [???] [???] ' it is also the custom for
ambassadors to use less insolence . but no one has threatened you . you have
naught to fear from us [???] until your errand is done . but unless your master
has come to new wisdom [???] then with all his servants you will be in great
peril . '
' so ! ' said the messenger . ' then thou art the [???] [???] old [???] ?
have we not heard of thee at whiles [???] and of thy wanderings [???] ever hatching
plots a nd mischief at a safe distance ? but this time thou hast stuck out thy
nose too far [???] master [???] ; and thou shalt see what comes to him who sets
his foolish webs before the feet of [???] the great . i have tokens that i
was bidden to show to thee - to thee in especial [???] if thou shouldst dare to
come . ' he signed to one of his guards [???] and he came forward bearing a bundle
[???] in black cloths .
the messenger put these aside [???] and there to the wonder and dismay of

all the captains he held up first the short sword that sam had carried [???] and
next a grey cloak with an elven - brooch [???] and last the coat of [???] - mail
that [???] had worn wrapped in his [???] garments . a blackness came
before their eyes [???] and it seemed to them in a moment of silence that the
world stood still [???] but their hearts were dead and their last hope gone .
[???] who stood behind prince [???] sprang forward with a cry of grief .
' silence ! ' said [???] sternly [???] thrusting him back ; but the messenger
laughed aloud .
' so you have yet another of these imps with you ! ' he cried . ' what use
you find in them i cannot guess ; but to send them as spies into [???] is
beyond even your accustomed folly . still [???] i thank him [???] for it is plain that
this brat at least has seen these tokens before [???] and it would be vain for
you to deny them now . '
' i do not wish to deny them [???] ' said [???] . ' indeed [???] i know them all
and all their history [???] and despite your scorn [???] foul mouth of [???] [???] you
cannot say as much . but why do you bring them here ? '
' dwarf - coat [???] elf - cloak [???] blade of the [???] west [???] and spy from the
little rat - land of the shire - nay ; do not start ! we know it well - here are
the marks of a conspiracy . now [???] maybe he that bore these things was a
creature that you would not grieve to lose [???] and maybe otherwise : one dear to
you [???] perhaps ? if so [???] take swift counsel with what little wit is left to you .
for [???] does not love spies [???] and what his fate shall be depends now on
your choice . '
no one answered him ; but he saw their faces grey with fear and the
horror in their eyes [???] and he laughed again [???] for it seemed to him that his
sport went well . ' good [???] good ! ' he said . ' he was dear to you [???] i see . or else
his errand was one that you did not wish to fail ? it has . and now he shall
endure the slow torment of years [???] as long and slow as our arts in the great
tower can contrive [???] and never be released [???] unless maybe when he is changed
and broken [???] so that he may come to you [???] and you shall see what you have
done . this shall surely be - unless you accept my lord ' s terms . '
' name the terms [???] ' said [???] steadily [???] but those nearby saw the
anguish in his face [???] and now he seemed an old and [???] man [???] crushed [???]
defeated at la st . they did not doubt that he would accept .
' these are the terms [???] ' said the messenger [???] and smiled as he eyed them
one by one . ' the rabble of [???] and its deluded allies shall withdraw at
once beyond the [???] [???] first taking oaths never again to assail [???] the

great in arms [???] open or secret . all lands east of [???] shall be [???] ' s
for ever [???] solely . west of the [???] as far as the misty mountains and the
gap of [???] shall be [???] to [???] [???] and men there shall bear no
weapons [???] but shall have leave to govern their own affairs . but they shall
help to rebuild [???] which they have wantonly destroyed [???] and that shall
be [???] ' s [???] and there his lieutenant shall dwell : not [???] [???] but one more
worthy of trust . '
looking in the messenger ' s eyes they read his thought . he was to be
that lieutenant [???] and gather all that remained of the west under his sway ; he
would be their tyrant and they his slaves .
but [???] said : ' this is much to demand for the delivery of one
servant : that your master should receive in exchange what he must else fight
many a war to gain ! or has the field of [???] destroyed his hope in war [???] so
that he falls to [???] ? and if indeed we rated this prisoner so high [???]
what surety have we that [???] the base master of treachery [???] will keep his
part ? where is this prisoner ? let him be brought forth and yielded to us [???]
and then we will consider these demands . '
it seemed then to [???] [???] intent [???] watching him as a man engaged in
[???] with a deadly foe [???] that for the taking of a breath the messenger was
at a loss ; yet swiftly he laughed again .
' do not bandy words in your insolence with the mouth of [???] ! ' he
cried . ' surety you crave ! [???] gives none . if you sue for his clemency you
must first do his bidding . these are his terms . take them or leave them ! '
' these we will take ! ' said [???] suddenly . he cast aside his cloak
and a white light shone forth like a sword in that black place . before his
[???] hand the foul messenger recoiled [???] and [???] coming seized and
took from him the tokens : coat [???] cloak [???] and sword . ' these we will take in
memory of our friend [???] ' he cried . ' but as for your terms [???] we reject them
utterly . get you gone [???] for your embassy is over and death is near to you . we
did not come here to waste words in treating with [???] [???] faithless and
accursed ; still less with one of his slaves . begone ! '
then the messenger of [???] laughed no more . his face was twisted with
amazement and anger to the likeness of some wild beast that [???] as it [???]
on its prey [???] is smitten on the [???] with a stinging rod . rage filled him
and his mouth slavered [???] and shapeless sounds of fury came strangling from
his throat . but he looked at the fell faces of the captains and their deadly
eyes [???] and fear overcame his wrath . he gave a great cry [???] and turned [???] leaped

upon his steed [???] and with his company [???] madly back to [???] [???] .
but as they went his soldiers blew their horns in signal long arranged ; and
even before they came to the gate [???] sprang his trap .
drums rolled and fires leaped up . the great doors of the black gate
swung back wide . out of it streamed a great host as swiftly as [???]
waters when a sluice is lifted .
the captains mounted again and rode back [???] and from the host of [???]
there went up a jeering yell . dust rose smothering the air [???] as from nearby
there marched up an army of [???] that had waited for the signal in
the shadows of ered [???] beyond the further tower . down from the hills on
either side of the [???] poured [???] [???] . the men of the west
were trapped [???] and soon . all about the grey mounds where they stood [???] forces
ten times and more than ten times their match would ring them in a sea of
enemies . [???] had taken the proffered bait in jaws of steel .
little time was left to [???] for the ordering of his battle . upon
the one hill he stood with [???] [???] and there fair and desperate was raised
the ba nner of the tree and stars . upon the other hill hard by stood the
banners of [???] and dol amroth [???] white horse and silver swan . and about
each
hill a ring was made facing all ways [???] [???] with spear and sword . but in
the front towards [???] where the first bitter assault would come there
stood the sons of [???] on the left with the d [???] nedain about them [???] and on
the right the prince [???] with the men of dol amroth tall and fair [???] and
picked men of the tower of guard .
the wind blew [???] and the trumpets sang [???] and arrows whined ; but the sun
now climbing towards the south was veiled in the reeks of [???] [???] and
through a threatening haze it gleamed [???] remote [???] a sullen red [???] as if it were
the ending of the day [???] or the end maybe of all the world of light . and out
of the gathering mirk the [???] came with . their cold voices crying words
of death ; and then all hope was quenched .
[???] had bowed crushed with horror when he heard [???] reject the
terms and doom [???] to the torment of the tower ; but he had mastered
himself [???] and now he stood beside [???] in the front rank of [???] with
[???] ' s men . for it seemed best to him to die soon and leave the bitter
story of his life [???] since all was in ruin .
' i wish merry was here [???] ' he heard himself saying [???] and quick thoughts
raced through his mind [???] even as he watched the enemy come charging to the

assault . ' well [???] well [???] now at any rate i understand poor [???] a little
better . we might die together [???] merry and i [???] and since die we must [???] why not ?
well [???] as he is not here [???] i hope he ' ll find an easier end . but now i must do
my best . '
he drew his sword and looked at it [???] and the [???] shapes of red
and gold ; and the flowing characters of n [???] menor glinted like fire upon the
blade . ' this was made for just such an hour [???] ' he thought . ' if only i could
smite that foul messenger with it [???] then almost i should draw level with old
merry . well [???] i ' ll smite some of this beastly brood before the end . i wish i
could see cool sunlight and green grass again ! '
then even as he thought these things the first assault [???] into
them . the [???] hindered by the mires that lay before the hills halted and
poured their arrows into the defending ranks . but through them there came
striding up [???] roaring like beasts [???] a great company of hill - [???] out of
[???] . taller and broader than men they were [???] and they were clad only in
close - fitting mesh of horny scales [???] or maybe that was their hideous hide ;
but they bore round bucklers huge and black and [???] heavy hammers in
their knotted hands . reckless they sprang into the [???] and waded across [???]
[???] as they came . like a storm they broke upon the line of the men of
[???] [???] and beat upon helm and head [???] and arm and shield as smiths hewing the
hot bending iron . at [???] ' s side [???] was [???] and [???] [???] and
he fell ; and the great troll - chief that smote him down bent over him [???]
reaching out a clutching claw ; for these fell creatures would bite the
throats of those that they threw down .
then [???] stabbed upwards [???] and the written blade of westernesse
pierced through the hide and went deep into the [???] of the troll [???] and his
black blood came [???] out . he toppled forward and came [???] down
like
a falling rock [???] burying those beneath him . blackness and stench and crushing
pain came upon [???] [???] and his mind fell away into a great darkness .
' so it ends as i guessed it would [???] ' his thought said [???] even as it
[???] away ; and it laughed a little within him ere it fled [???] almost gay
it seemed to be casting off at last all doubt and care and fear . and then
even as it winged away into forgetfulness it heard voices [???] and they seemed
to be crying in some forgotten world far above :
' the eagles are coming ! the eagles are coming ! '
for one moment more [???] ' s thought hovered . ' [???] ! ' it said . ' but

no ! that came in his tale [???] long long ago . this is my tale [???] and it is ended
now . good - bye ! ' and his thought fled far away and his eyes saw no more .

chapter 1 . the tower of [???] ungol



sam roused himself painfully from the ground . for a moment he wondered
where he was [???] and then all the misery and despair returned to him . he was in
the deep dark outside the under - gate of the [???] ' stronghold ; its brazen
doors were shut . he must have fallen [???] when he hurled himself against
them ; but how long he had lain there he did not know . then he had been on
fire [???] desperate and furious ; now he was shivering and cold . he crept to the
doors and pressed his ears against them .
far within he could hear faintly the voices of ores clamouring [???] but
soon they stopped or passed out of hearing [???] and all was still . his head
ached and his eyes saw [???] lights in the darkness [???] but he struggled to
steady himself and think . it was clear at any rate that he had no hope of
getting into the orc - hold by that gate ; he might wait there for days before
it was opened [???] and he could not wait : time was desperately precious . he no
longer had any doubt about his duty : he must rescue his master or perish in
the attempt .
' the perishing is more likely [???] and will be a lot easier anyway [???] ' he
said grimly to himself [???] as he sheathed sting and turned from the brazen
doors . slowly he groped his way back in the dark along the tunnel [???] not
daring to use the elven - light ; and as he went he tried to fit together the
events since [???] and he had left the cross - roads . he wondered what the
time was . somewhere between one day and the next [???] he supposed ; but even of
the days he had quite lost count . he was in a land of darkness where the
days of the world seemed forgotten [???] and where all who entered were forgotten
too .
' i wonder if they think of us at all [???] ' he said [???] ' and what is happening
to them all away there . ' he waved his hand vaguely in the air before him ;
but he was in fact now facing southwards [???] as he came back to [???] ' s
tunnel [???] not west . out westward in the world it was drawing to noon upon the
fourteenth day of march in the shire - reckoning . and even now [???] was
leading the black fleet from [???] [???] and merry was riding with the

[???] down the [???] valley [???] while in minas [???] flames were rising
and [???] watched the madness growing in the eyes of [???] . yet amid all
their cares and fear the thoughts of their friends turned constantly to
[???] and sam . they were not forgotten . but they were far beyond aid [???] and no
thought could yet bring any help to [???] hamfast ' s son ; he was utterly
alone .

he came back at last to the stone door of the orc - passage [???] and still
unable to discover the catch or bolt that held it [???] he [???] over as
before and dropped softly to the ground . then he made his way [???] to
the outlet of [???] ' s tunnel [???] where the rags of her great web were still
blowing and swaying in the cold airs . for cold they seemed to sam after the
noisome darkness behind ; but the breath of them revived him . he crept
[???] out .
all was [???] quiet . the light was no more than that of [???] at a
dark day ' s end . the vast vapours that arose in [???] and went streaming
westward passed low overhead [???] a great welter of cloud and smoke now lit
again beneath with a sullen glow of red .
sam looked up towards the orc - tower [???] and suddenly from its narrow
windows lights stared out like small red eyes . he wondered if they were some
signal . his fear of the [???] [???] forgot ten for a while in his wrath and
desperation [???] now returned . as far as he could see [???] there was only one
possible course for him to take : he must go on and try to find the main
entrance to the dreadful tower ; but his knees felt weak [???] and he found that
he was trembling . drawing his eyes down from the tower and the horns of the
cleft before him [???] he forced his unwilling feet to obey him [???] and slowly [???]
listening with all his ears [???] peering into the dense shadows of the rocks
beside the way [???] he [???] his steps [???] past the place where [???] fell [???] and
still the stench of [???] lingered [???] and then on and up [???] until he stood
again in the very cleft where he had put on the ring and seen [???] ' s
company go by .
there he halted and sat down . for the moment he could drive himself no
further . he felt that if once he went beyond the crown of the pass and took
one step [???] down into the land of [???] [???] that step would be
[???] . he could never come back . without a ny clear purpose he drew out
the ring and put it on again . immediately he felt the great burden of its
weight [???] and felt afresh [???] but now more strong and urgent than ever [???] the

malice of the eye of [???] [???] searching [???] trying to pierce the shadows that it
had made for its own defence [???] but which now hindered it in its unquiet and
doubt .
as before [???] sam found that his hearing was sharpened [???] but that to his
sight the things of this world seemed thin and vague . the rocky walls of the
path were pale [???] as if seen through a mist [???] but still at a distance he heard
the [???] of [???] in her misery : and harsh and clear [???] and very close it
seemed [???] he heard cries and the clash of metal . he sprang to his feet [???] and
pressed himself against the wall beside the road . he was glad of the ring [???]
for here was yet another company of [???] on the march . or so at first he
thought . then suddenly he realized that it was not so [???] his hearing had
deceived him : the orc - cries came from the tower [???] whose topmost horn was
now
right above him [???] on the left hand of the cleft .
sam [???] and tried to force himself to move . there was plainly
some devilry going on . perhaps in spite of all orders the cruelty of the
[???] had mastered them [???] and they were tormenting [???] [???] or even savagely
hacking him to pieces . he listened ; and as he did a gleam of hope came to
him . there could not be much doubt : there was fighting in the tower [???] the
[???] must be at war among themselves [???] [???] and [???] had come to
blows .
faint as was the hope that his guess brought him [???] it was enough to rouse
him . there might be just a chance . his love for [???] rose above all other
thoughts [???] and forgetting his peril he cried aloud : ' i ' m coming [???] mr . [???] ! '
he ran forward to the climbing path [???] and over it . at once the road
turned left and [???] steeply down . sam had crossed into [???] .

he took off the ring [???] moved it may be by some deep [???] of
danger [???] though to himself he thought only that he wished to see more
clearly . ` better have a look at the worst [???] ' he muttered . ` no good [???]
about in a fog ! '
hard and cruel and bitter was the land that met his gaze . before his
feet the highest ridge of the [???] d [???] ath fell steeply in great cliffs down
into a dark trough [???] on the further side of which there rose another ridge [???]
much lower [???] its edge notched and jagged with crags like fangs that stood out
black against the red light behind them : it was the grim [???] [???] the inner
ring of the fences of the land . far beyond it [???] but almost straight ahead [???]

across a wide lake of darkness dotted with tiny fires [???] there was a great
burning glow ; and from it rose in huge [???] a [???] smoke [???] dusty red
at the roots [???] black above where it merged into the [???] canopy that
roofed in all the accursed land .
sam was looking at [???] [???] the mountain of fire . ever and anon the
furnaces far below its ashen cone would grow hot and with a great surging
and [???] pour forth rivers of [???] rock from [???] in its sides .
some would flow blazing towards barad - dyr down great channels ; some
would
wind their way into the stony plain [???] until they cooled and lay like twisted
dragon - shapes [???] from the tormented earth . in such an hour of labour
sam beheld mount doom [???] and the light of it [???] cut off by the high screen of
the [???] d [???] ath from those who climbed up the path from the west [???] now
glared
against the stark rock faces [???] so that they seemed to be drenched with blood .
in that dreadful light sam stood [???] [???] for now [???] looking to his left [???]
he could see the tower of [???] ungol in all its strength . the horn that he
had seen from the other side was only its topmost turret . its eastern face
stood up in three great tiers from a shelf in the mountain - wall far below ;
its back was to a great cliff behind [???] from which it [???] out in pointed
bastions [???] one above the other [???] diminishing as they rose [???] with sheer sides of
cunning [???] that looked north - east and south - east . about the lowest
tier [???] two hundred feet below where sam now stood [???] there was a [???]
wall enclosing a narrow court . its gate [???] upon the near south - eastern side [???]
opened on a broad road [???] the outer [???] of which ran upon the brink of a
[???] [???] until it turned southward and went winding down into the darkness
to join the road that came over the [???] pass . then on it went through a
jagged rift in the [???] out into the valley of [???] and away to
barad - dyr . the narrow upper way on which sam stood leapt swiftly down
by
stair and steep path to meet the main road under the frowning walls close to
the tower - gate .
as he gazed at it suddenly sam understood [???] almost with a shock [???] that
this stronghold had been built not to keep enemies out of [???] [???] but to
keep them in . it was indeed one of the works of [???] long ago [???] an eastern
[???] of the defences of [???] [???] made when [???] after the last alliance [???] men
of westernesse kept watch on the evil land of [???] where his creatures

still lurked . but as with [???] and [???] [???] the towers of the teeth [???] so
here too the [???] had failed [???] and treachery had yielded up the tower to
the lord of the [???] [???] and now for long years it had been held by evil
things . since his return to [???] [???] [???] had found it useful ; for he had
few servants but many slaves of fear [???] and still its chief purpose as of old
was to prevent escape from [???] . though if an enemy were so rash as to try
to enter that land secretly [???] then it was also a last [???] guard
against any that might pass the [???] of [???] and of [???] .
only too clearly sam saw how hopeless it would be for him to creep down
under those many - eyed walls and pass the watchful gate . and even if he did
so [???] he could not go far on the guarded road beyond : not even the black
shadows [???] lying deep where the red glow could not reach [???] would shield him
long from the night - eyed [???] . but desperate as that road might be [???] his task
was now far worse : not to avoid the gate and escape [???] but to enter it [???] alone .

his thought turned to the ring [???] but there was no comfort there [???] only
dread and danger . no sooner had he come in sight of mount doom [???] burning
far
away [???] than he was aware of a cha nge in his burden . as it drew near the great
furnaces where [???] in the deeps of time [???] it had been shaped and forged [???] the
ring ' s power grew [???] and it became more fell [???] [???] save by some mighty
will . as sam stood there [???] even though the ring was not on him but hanging by
its chain about his neck [???] he felt himself enlarged [???] as if he were robed in a
huge distorted shadow of himself [???] a vast and [???] threat halted upon the
walls of [???] . he felt that he had from now on only two choices : to
forbear the ring [???] though it would torment him ; or to claim it [???] and challenge
the power that sat in its dark hold beyond the valley of shadows . already
the ring tempted him [???] gnawing at his will and reason . wild [???] arose
in his mind ; and he saw [???] the strong [???] hero of the age [???] striding with a
flaming sword across the darkened land [???] and armies flocking to his call as
he marched to the overthrow of barad - dyr . and then all the clouds rolled
away [???] and the white sun shone [???] and at his command the vale of [???]
became a garden of flowers and trees and brought forth fruit . he had only to
put on the ring and claim it for his own [???] and all this could be .
in that hour of trial it was the love of his master that helped most to
hold him firm ; but also deep down in him lived still [???] his plain
hobbit - sense : he knew in the core of his heart that he was not large enough

to bear such a burden [???] even if such visions were not a mere cheat to betray
him . the one small garden of a free gardener was all his need and due [???] not a
garden [???] to a realm ; his own hands to use [???] not the hands of others to
command .
' and anyway all these notions are only a trick [???] ' he said to himself .
' he ' d spot me and cow me [???] before i could so much as shou t out . he ' d spot me [???]
pretty quick [???] if i put the ring on now [???] in [???] . well [???] all i can say is :
things look as hopeless as a frost in spring . just when being invisible
would be really useful [???] i can ' t use the ring ! and if ever i get any further [???]
it ' s going to be nothing but a drag and a burden every step . so what ' s to be
done ? '
he was not really in any doubt . he knew that he must go down to the
gate and not linger any more . with a shrug of his shoulders [???] as if to shake
off the shadow and dismiss the [???] [???] he began slowly to descend . with
each step he seemed to diminish . he had not gone far before he had shrunk
again to a very small and frightened hobbit . he was now passing under the
very walls of the tower [???] and the cries and sounds of fighting could be heard
with his [???] ears . at the moment the noise seemed to be coming from the
court behind the outer wall .

sam was about half way down the path when out of the dark gateway into
the red glow there came two [???] running . they did not turn towards him .
they were making for the main road ; but even as they ran they [???] and
fell to the ground and lay still . sam had seen no arrows [???] but he guessed
that the [???] had been shot down by others on the battlements or hidden in
the shadow of the gate . he went on [???] hugging the wall on his left . one look
upward had shown him that there was no hope of climbing it . the stone - work
rose thirty feet [???] without a crack or ledge [???] to [???] courses like
inverted steps . the gate was the only way .
he crept on ; and as he went he wondered how many [???] lived in the
tower with [???] [???] and how many [???] had [???] and what they were
quarrelling
about [???] if that was what was happening . [???] ' s company had seemed to be
about forty [???] and [???] ' s more than twice as large ; but of course [???] ' s
patrol had only been a part of his [???] . almost certainly they were
quarrelling about [???] [???] and the spoil . for a second sam halted [???] for
suddenly things seemed clear to him [???] almost as if he had seen them with his

eyes . the [???] coat ! of course [???] [???] was wearing it [???] and they would find
it . and from what sam had heard [???] would covet it . but the orders of the
dark tower were at present [???] ' s only protection [???] and if they were set
aside [???] [???] might be killed out of hand at any moment .
' come on [???] you miserable [???] ! ' sam cried to himself . ` now for it ! '
he drew sting and ran towards the open gate . but just as he was about to
pass under its great arch he felt a shock : as if he had run into some web
like [???] ' s [???] only invisible . he could see no obstacle [???] but something too
strong for his will to overcome barred the way . he looked about [???] and then
within the shadow of the gate he saw the two watchers .
they were like great figures seated upon thrones . each had three joined
bodies [???] and three heads facing outward [???] and inward [???] and across the gateway .
the heads had [???] - faces [???] and on their great knees were laid [???]
hands . they seemed to be carved out of huge blocks of stone [???] [???] [???] and
yet they were aware : some dreadful spirit of evil [???] [???] in them .
they knew an enemy . visible or invisible none could pass [???] . they
would forbid his entry [???] or his escape .
hardening his will sam thrust forward once again [???] and halted with a
jerk [???] [???] as if from a blow upon his breast and head . then greatly
daring [???] because he could think of nothing else to do [???] answering a sudden
thought that came to him [???] he drew slowly out the phial of [???] and held
it up . its white light quickened swiftly [???] and the shadows under the dark
arch fled . the monstrous watchers sat there cold and still [???] revealed in all
their hideous shape . for a moment sam caught a glitter in the black stones
of their eyes [???] the very malice of which made him quail ; but slowly he felt
their will waver and crumble into fear .
he sprang past them ; but even as he did so [???] thrusting the phial back
into his bosom [???] he was aware [???] as plainly as if a bar of steel had snapped to
behind him [???] that their [???] was renewed . and from those evil heads
there came a high shrill cry that echoed in the towering walls before him .
far up above [???] like an answering signal [???] a harsh bell clanged a single
stroke .

' that ' s done it ! ' said sam . ` now i ' ve rung the front - door bell ! well [???]
come on somebody ! ' he cried . ` tell captain [???] that the great
elf - warrior has called [???] with his elf - sword too ! '
there was no answer . sam strode forward . sting glittered blue in his

hand . the courtyard lay in deep shadow [???] but he could see that the pavement
was strewn with bodies . right at his feet were two orc - archers with knives
sticking in their backs . beyond lay many more shapes ; some singly as they
had been hewn down or shot ; others in pairs [???] still [???] one another [???]
dead in the very throes of stabbing [???] [???] [???] biting . the stones were
slippery with dark blood .
two liveries sam noticed [???] one marked by the red eye [???] the other by a
moon [???] with a ghastly face of death ; but he did not stop to look
more closely . across the court a great door at the foot of the tower stood
half open [???] and a red light came through ; a large orc lay dead upon the
[???] . sam sprang over the body and went in ; and then he peered about at
a loss .
a wide and echoing passage led back from the door towards the
mountain - side . it was dimly lit with torches flaring in [???] on the
walls [???] but its distant end was lost in gloom . many doors and openings could
be seen on this side and that ; but it was empty save for two or three more
bodies [???] on the floor . from what he had heard of the captains ' talk
sam knew that [???] dead or alive [???] [???] would most likely be found in a chamber
high up in the turret far above ; but he might search for a day before he
found the way .
' it ' ll be near the back [???] i guess [???] ' sam muttered . ` the whole tower
climbs backwards - like . and anyway i ' d better follow these lights . '
he advanced down the passage [???] but slowly now [???] each step more [???] .
terror was beginning to grip him again . there was no sound save the rap of
his feet [???] which seemed to grow to an echoing noise [???] like the slapping of
great hands upon the stones . the dead bodies : the emptiness ; the dank black
walls that in the torchlight seemed to drip with blood ; the fear of sudden
death lurking in doorway or shadow ; and behind all his mind the waiting
watchful malice at the gate : it was almost more than he could screw himself
to face . he would have welcomed a fight - with not too many enemies at a time
- rather than this hideous brooding uncertainty . he forced himself to think
of [???] [???] lying bound or in pain or dead somewhere in this dreadful place .
he went on .
he had passed beyond the torchlight [???] almost to a great arched door at
the end of the passage [???] the inner side of the under gate [???] as he rightly
guessed [???] when there came from high above a dreadful choking shriek . he
stopped short . then he heard feet coming . someone was running in great haste

down an echoing stairway overhead .
his will was too weak and slow to restrain his hand . it dragged at the
chain and clutched the ring . but sam did not put it on ; for even as he
clasped it to his breast [???] an orc came [???] down . leaping out of a dark
opening at the right [???] it ran towards him . it was no more than six paces from
him when [???] lifting its head [???] it saw him ; and sam could hear its gasping
breath and see the glare in its [???] eyes . it stopped short [???] . for
what it saw was not a small frightened hobbit trying to hold a steady sword :
it saw a great silent shape [???] cloaked in a grey shadow [???] looming against the
wavering light behind ; in one hand it held a sword [???] the very light of which
was a bitter pain [???] the other was clutched at its breast [???] but held concealed
some nameless menace of power and doom .
for a moment the orc [???] [???] and then with a hideous [???] of fear it
turned and fled back as it had come . never was any dog more heartened when
its enemy turned tail than sam at this unexpected flight . with a shout he
gave chase .
` yes ! the elf - warrior is loose ! ' he cried . ' i ' m coming . just you show
me the way up [???] or i ' ll skin you ! '
but the orc was in its own haunts [???] nimble and well - fed . sam was a
stranger [???] hungry and weary . the stairs were high and steep and winding .
sam ' s breath began to come in [???] . the orc had soon passed out of sight [???]
and now only faintly could be heard the slapping of its feet as it went on
and up . every now and again it gave a yell [???] and the echo ran along the
walls . but slowly all sound of it died away .
sam [???] on . he felt that he was on the right road [???] and his spirits
had risen a good deal . he thrust the ring away and tightened his belt .
` well [???] well ! ' he said . ` if only they all take such a dislike to me and my
sting [???] this may turn out better than i hoped . and anyway it looks as if
[???] [???] [???] [???] and company have done nearly all my job for me . except for
that little frightened rat [???] i do believe there ' s nobody left alive in the
place ! '
and with that he stopped [???] brought up hard [???] as if he had hit his head
against the stone wall . the full meaning of what he had said struck him like
a blow . nobody left alive ! whose had been that horrible dying shriek ?
` [???] [???] [???] ! master ! ' he cried half [???] . ' if they ' ve killed you [???] what
shall i do ? well [???] i ' m coming at last [???] right to the top [???] to see what i must . '


up [???] up he went . it was dark save for an occasional torch flaring at a
turn [???] or beside some opening that led into the higher levels of the tower .
sam tried to count the steps [???] but after two hundred he lost his reckoning .
he was moving quietly now : for he thought that he could hear the sound of
voices talking [???] still some way above . more than one rat remained alive [???] it
seemed .
all at once [???] when he felt that he could pump out no more breath [???] nor
force his knees to bend again [???] the stair ended . he stood still . the voices
were now loud and near . sam peered about . he had climbed right to the flat
roof of the third and highest tier of the tower : an open space [???] about twenty
yards across [???] with a low [???] . there the stair was covered by a small
domed chamber in the midst of the roof [???] with low doors facing east and west .
eastward sam could see the plain of [???] vast and dark below [???] and the
burning mountain far away . a fresh [???] was surging in its deep wells [???]
and the rivers of fire blazed so fiercely that even at this distance of many
miles the light of them lit the tower - top with a red glare . westward the
view was blocked by the base of the great turret that stood at the back of
this upper court and reared its horn high above the crest of the [???]
hills . light gleamed in a window - slit . its door was not ten yards from where
sam stood . it was open but dark [???] and from just within its shadow the voices
came .
at first sam did not listen ; he took a pace out of the eastward door
and looked about . at once he saw that up here the fighting had been
fiercest . all the court was choked with dead [???] or their severed and
scattered heads and limbs . the place stank of death . a [???] followed by a
blow and a cry sent him darting back into hiding . an orc - voice rose in
anger [???] and he knew it again at once [???] harsh [???] brutal [???] cold . it was [???]
speaking [???] captain of the tower .
` you won ' t go again [???] you say ? curse you [???] [???] [???] you little [???] ! if
you think i ' m so damaged that it ' s safe to flout me [???] you ' re mistaken come
here [???] and i ' ll [???] your eyes out [???] like i did to [???] just now . and
when some new lads come [???] i ' ll deal with you : i ' ll send you to [???] . '
` they won ' t come [???] not before you ' re dead anyway [???] ' answered [???]
[???] . ' i ' ve told you twice that [???] ' s swine got to the gate first [???] and
none of ours got out . [???] and [???] ran through [???] but they were shot . i
saw it from a window [???] i tell you . and they wer e the last . '
' then you must go . i must stay here anyway . but i ' m hurt . the black

pits take that filthy rebel [???] ! ' [???] ' s voice trailed off into a
string of foul names and curses . ` i gave him better than i got [???] but he
knifed me [???] the dung [???] before i [???] him . you must go [???] or i ' ll eat you .
news must get through to [???] [???] rz [???] or we ' ll both be for the black pits . yes [???]
you too . you won ' t escape by [???] here . '
` i ' m not going down those stairs again [???] ' growled [???] [???] ` be you captain
or no . nar ! keep your hands off your knife [???] or i ' ll put an arrow in your
guts . you won ' t be a captain long when they hear about all these goings - on .
i ' ve fought for the tower against those stinking [???] - rats [???] but a nice
mess you two precious captains have made of things [???] fighting over the swag . '
' that ' s enough from you [???] ' [???] [???] . ` i had my orders . it was
[???] started it [???] trying to pinch that pretty shirt . '
` well [???] you put his back up [???] being so high and mighty . and he had more
sense than you anyway . he told you more than once that the most dangerous of
these spies was still loose [???] and you wouldn ' t listen . and you won ' t listen
now . [???] was right [???] i tell you . there ' s a great fighter about [???] one of
those bloody - handed elves [???] or one of the filthy tarks . 1 he ' s coming here [???] i
tell you . you heard the bell . he ' s got past the watchers [???] and that ' s tark ' s
work . he ' s on the stairs . and until he ' s off them [???] i ' m not going down . not
if you were a [???] [???] i wouldn ' t . '
` so that ' s it [???] is it ? ' yelled [???] . ' you ' ll do this [???] and you ' ll not
do that ? and when he does come [???] you ' ll bolt and leave me ? no [???] you won ' t !
i ' ll put red [???] - holes in your belly first . '
out of the turret - door the smaller orc came flying . behind him came
[???] [???] a large orc with long arms that [???] as he ran [???] [???] reached to
the ground . but one arm hung limp and seemed to be bleeding ; the other
hugged a large black bundle . in the red glare sam [???] cowering behind the
stair - door [???] caught a glimpse of his evil face as it passed : it was scored as
if by rending claws and smeared with blood ; slaver dripped from its
[???] fangs ; the mouth [???] like an animal .
as far as sam could see [???] [???] hunted [???] round the roof [???] until
ducking and eluding him the smaller orc with a [???] darted back into the
turret and disappeared . then [???] halted . out of the eastward door sam
could see him now by the [???] [???] panting [???] his left claw [???] and
[???] feebly . he put the bundle on the floor and with his right claw
drew out a long red knife and spat on it . going to the [???] he leaned
over [???] looking down into the outer court far below . twice he shouted but no

answer came .
suddenly [???] as [???] was stooped over the battlement [???] his back to the
roof - top [???] sam to his amazement saw that one of the [???] bodies was
moving . it was [???] . it put out a claw and clutched the bundle . it
[???] up . in its other hand it held a broad - headed spear with a short
broken haft . it was poised for a stabbing thrust . but at that very moment a
hiss escaped its teeth [???] a gasp of pain or hate . quick as a snake [???]
slipped aside [???] twisted round [???] and drove his knife into his enemy ' s throat .
` got you [???] [???] ! ' he cried . ' not quite dead [???] eh ? well [???] i ' ll finish my
job now . ' he sprang on to the fallen body [???] and stamped and trampled it in
his fury [???] stooping now and again to stab and slash it with his knife .
satisfied at last [???] he threw back his head and let out a horrible [???]
yell of triumph . then he licked his knife [???] and put it between his teeth [???] and
catching up the bundle he came loping towards the near door of the stairs .
sam had no time to think . he might have slipped out of the other door [???]
but hardly without being seen ; and he could not have played hide - and - seek
with this hideous orc for long . he did what was probably the best thing he
could have done . he sprang out to meet [???] with a shout . he was no
longer holding the ring [???] but it was there [???] a hidden power [???] a cowing menace
to the slaves of [???] ; and in his hand was sting [???] and its light smote the
eyes of the orc like the glitter of cruel stars in the terrible
elf - countries [???] the dream of which was a cold fear to all his kind . and
[???] could not both fight and keep hold of his treasure . he stopped [???]
growling [???] baring his fangs . then once more [???] orc - fashion [???] he leapt aside [???] and
as sam sprang at him [???] using the heavy bundle as both shield and weapon [???] he
thrust it hard into his enemy ' s face . sam [???] [???] and before he could
recover [???] [???] darted past and down the stairs .
sam ran after him [???] cursing [???] but he did not go far . soon the thought of
[???] returned to him [???] and he remembered that the other orc had gone back
into the turret . here was another dreadful choice [???] and he had no time to
ponder it . if [???] got away [???] he would soon get help and come back . but if
sam pursued him [???] the other orc might do some horrible deed up there . and
anyway sam might miss [???] or be killed by him . he turned quickly and ran
back up the stairs . ` wrong again [???] i expect [???] ' he sighed . ` but it ' s my job to
go right up to the top first [???] whatever happens afterwards . '
away below [???] went leaping down the stairs and out over the court
and through the gate [???] bearing his precious burden . if sam could have seen

him and known the grief that his escape would bring [???] he might have [???] .
but now his mind was set on the last stage of his search . he came [???]
to the turret - door and stepped inside . it opened into darkness . but soon his
staring eyes were aware of a dim light at his right hand . it came from an
opening that led to another stairway [???] dark and narrow : it appeared to go
winding up the turret along the inside of its round outer wall . a torch was
[???] from somewhere up above .
softly sam began to climb . he came to the [???] torch [???] fixed above
a door on his left that faced a window - slit looking out westward : one of the
red eyes that he and [???] had seen from down below by the tunnel ' s mouth .
quickly sam passed the door and hurried on to the second storey [???] dreading at
any moment to he attacked and to feel [???] fingers seize his throat
from behind . he came next to a window looking east and another torch above
the door to a passage through the middle of the turret . the door was open [???]
the passage dark save for the glimmer of the torch and the red glare from
outside filtering through the window - slit . but here the stair stopped and
climbed no further . sam crept into the passage . on either side there was a
low door ; both were closed and locked . there was no sound at all .
` a dead end [???] ' muttered sam ; ` and after all my climb ! this can ' t be the
top of the tower . but what can i do now ? '
he ran back to the lower storey and tried the door . it would not move .
he ran up again [???] and sweat began to trickle down his face . he felt that even
minutes were precious [???] but one by one they escaped ; and he could do nothing .
he cared no longer for [???] or [???] or any other orc that was ever
[???] . he longed only for his master [???] for one sight of his face or one
touch of his hand .
at last [???] weary and feeling finally defeated [???] he sat on a step below the
level of the passage - floor and bowed his head into his hands . it was quiet [???]
horribly quiet . the torch [???] that was already burning low when he arrived [???]
[???] and went out ; and he felt the darkness cover him like a tide . and
then softly [???] to his own surprise [???] there at the vain end of his long journey
and his grief [???] moved by what thought in his heart he could not tell [???] sam
began to sing .
his voice sounded thin and [???] in the cold dark tower : the voice
of a forlorn and weary hobbit that no listening orc could possibly mistake
for the clear song of an elven - lord . he murmured old childish tunes out of
the shire [???] and snatches of mr . [???] ' s rhymes that came into his mind like

fleeting [???] of the country of his home . and then suddenly new strength
rose in him [???] and his voice rang out [???] while words of his own came [???] to
fit the simple tune .
in western lands beneath the sun
the flowers may rise in spring [???]
the trees may bud [???] the wa ters run [???]
the merry finches sing .
or there maybe ' tis cloudless night
and swaying beeches bear
the elven - stars as jewels white
amid their branching hair .

though here at journey ' s end i lie
in darkness buried deep [???]
beyond all towers strong and high [???]
beyond all mountains steep [???]
above all shadows rides the sun
and stars for ever dwell :
i will not say the day is done [???]
nor bid the stars farewell .
` beyond all towers strong and high [???] ' he began again [???] and then he
stopped short . he thought that he had heard a faint voice answering him . but
now he could hear nothing . yes [???] he could hear something [???] but not a voice .
[???] were approaching . now a door was being opened quietly in the
passage above ; the [???] creaked . sam [???] down listening . the door
closed with a dull thud ; and then a [???] orc - voice rang out .
' ho la ! you up there [???] you dunghill rat ! stop your squeaking [???] or i ' ll
come and deal with you . d ' you hear ? '
there was no answer .
' all right [???] ' growled [???] . ` but i ' ll come and have a look at you all
the same [???] and see what you ' re up to . '
the [???] creaked again [???] and sam [???] now peering over the corner of the
passage - [???] [???] saw a [???] of light in an open doorway [???] and the dim
shape of an orc coming out . he seemed to be carrying a ladder . suddenly the
answer [???] on sam : the topmost chamber was reached by a trap - door in
the
roof of the passage . [???] thrust the ladder upwards [???] steadied it [???] and then

[???] out of sight . sam heard a bolt drawn back . then he heard the
hideous voice speaking again .
` you lie quiet [???] or you ' ll pay for it ! you ' ve not got long to live in
peace [???] i guess ; but if you don ' t want the fun to begin right now [???] keep your
trap shut [???] see ? there ' s a reminder for you ! ' there was a sound like the
crack of a whip .
at that rage blazed in sam ' s heart to a sudden fury . he sprang up [???] ran [???]
and went up the ladder like a cat . his head came out in the middle of the
floor of a large round chamber . a red lamp hung from its roof ; the westward
window - slit was high and dark . something was lying on the floor by the wall
under the window [???] but over it a black orc - shape was [???] . it raised a
whip a second time [???] but the blow never fell .
with a cry sam leapt across the floor [???] sting in hand . the orc wheeled
round [???] but before it could make a move sam [???] its whip - hand from its
arm . howling with pain and fear but desperate the orc charged head - down at
him . sam ' s next blow went wide [???] and thrown off his balance he fell
backwards [???] clutching at the orc as it [???] over him . before he could
scramble up he heard a cry and a thud . the orc in its wild haste had tripped
on the ladder - head and fallen through the open trap - door . sam gave no more
thought to it . he ran to the figure [???] on the floor . it was [???] .

he was naked [???] lying as if in a swoon on a heap of filthy rags : his arm
was flung up [???] shielding his head [???] and across his side there ran an ugly
whip - weal .
` [???] ! mr . [???] [???] my dear ! ' cried sam [???] tears almost blinding him .
` it ' s sam [???] i ' ve come ! ' he half lifted his master and hugged him to his
breast . [???] opened his eyes .
` am i still dreaming ? ' he muttered . ` but the other dreams were
horrible . '
` you ' re not dreaming at all [???] master [???] ' said sam . ` it ' s real . it ' s me .
i ' ve come . '
` i can hardly believe it [???] ' said [???] [???] clutching him . ` there was an orc
with a whip [???] and then it turns into sam ! then i wasn ' t dreaming after all
when i heard that singing down below [???] and i tried to answer ? was it you ? '
' it was indeed [???] mr . [???] . i ' d given up hope [???] almost . i couldn ' t find
you .
well [???] you have now [???] sam [???] dear sam [???] said [???] [???] and he la back in sam ' s

gentle arms [???] closing his eyes [???] like a child at rest when night - fears are
driven away by some loved voice or hand .
sam felt that he could sit like that in endless happiness ; but it was
not allowed . it was not enough for him to find his master [???] he had still to
try and save him . he kissed [???] ' s forehead . ` come ! wake up mr . [???] ! ' he
said [???] trying to sound as cheerful as he had when he drew back the curtains
at bag end on a summer ' s morning .
[???] sighed and sat up . ` where are we ? how did i get here ? ' he asked .
' there ' s no time for tales till we get somewhere else [???] mr . [???] [???] ' said
sam . ` but you ' re in the top of that tower you and me saw from away down by
the tunnel before the [???] got you . how long ago that wa s i don ' t know . more
than a day [???] i guess . '
` only that ? ' said [???] . ` it seems weeks . you must tell me all about
it [???] if we get a chance . something hit me [???] didn ' t it ? and i fell into
darkness and foul dreams [???] and woke and found that waking was worse . [???]
were all round me . i think they had just been pouring some horrible burning
drink down my throat . my head grew clear [???] but i was aching and weary . they
stripped me of everything ; and then two great brutes came and questioned me [???]
questioned me until i thought i should go mad [???] standing over me [???] gloating [???]
fingering their knives . i ' ll never forget their claws and eyes . '
` you won ' t [???] if you talk about them [???] mr . [???] [???] ' said sam . ' and if we
don ' t want to see them again [???] the sooner we get going the better . can you
walk ? '
` yes [???] i can walk [???] ' said [???] [???] getting up slowly . ' i am not hurt sam .
only i feel very tired [???] and i ' ve a pain here . ' he put his hand to the back
of his neck above his left shoulder . he stood up [???] and it looked to sam as if
he was clothed in flame : his naked skin was scarlet in the light of the lamp
above . twice he paced across the floor .
` that ' s better ! ' he said [???] his spirits rising a little . ` i didn ' t dare
to move when i was left alone [???] or one of the guards came . until the yelling
and fighting began . the two big brutes : they quarrelled [???] i think . over me
and my things . i lay here terrified . and then all went deadly quiet [???] and
that was worse . '
` yes [???] they quarrelled [???] seemingly [???] ' said sam . ( there must have been a
couple of hundred of the dirty creatures in this place . a bit of a tall
order for sam [???] [???] as you might say . but they ' ve done all the killing of
themselves . that ' s lucky [???] but it ' s too long to make a song about [???] till we ' re

out of here . now what ' s to be done ? you can ' t go walking in the black land
in naught but your skin [???] mr . [???] . '
` they ' ve taken everything [???] sam [???] ' said [???] . ` everything i had . do you
understand ? everything ! ' he cowered on the floor again with bowed head [???] as
his own words brought home to him the fullness of the disaster [???] and despair
overwhelmed him . ' the quest has failed sam . even if we get out of here [???] we
can ' t escape . only elves can escape . away [???] away out of middle - earth [???] far
away over the sea . if even that is wide enough to keep the shadow out . '
` no [???] not everything [???] mr . [???] . and it hasn ' t failed [???] not yet . i took
it [???] mr . [???] [???] begging your pardon . and i ' ve kept it safe . it ' s round my
neck now [???] and a terrible burden it is [???] too . ' sam [???] for the ring and
its chain . ` but i suppose you must take it back . ' now it had come to it [???] sam
felt [???] to give up the ring and burden his master with it again .
` you ' ve got it ? ' gasped [???] . ` you ' ve got it here ? sam [???] you ' re a
marvel ! ' then quickly and strangely his tone changed . ` give it to me ! ' he
cried [???] standing up [???] holding out a trembling hand . ` give it me at once ! you
can ' t have it ! '
' all right [???] mr . [???] [???] ' said sam [???] rather startled . ' here it is ! ' slowly
he drew the ring out and passed the chain over his head . ` but you ' re in the
land of [???] now [???] sir ; and when you get out [???] you ' ll see the fiery mountain
and all . you ' ll find the ring very dangerous now [???] and very hard to bear . if
it ' s too hard a job [???] i could share it with you [???] maybe ? '
` no [???] no ! ' cried [???] [???] snatching the ring and chain from sam ' s hands .
` no you won ' t [???] you thief ! ' he panted [???] staring at sam with eyes wide with
fear and enmity . then suddenly [???] clasping the ring in one [???] fist [???] he
stood [???] . a mist seemed to clear from his eyes [???] and he passed a hand
over his aching brow . the hideous vision had seemed so real to him [???] half
[???] as he was still with wound and fear . sam had changed before his very
eyes into an orc again [???] leering and [???] at his treasure [???] a foul little
creature with greedy eyes and [???] mouth . but now the vision had
passed . there was sam kneeling before him [???] his face wrung with pain [???] as if
he had been stabbed in the heart ; tears welled from his eyes .
' o sam ! ' cried [???] . ` what have i said ? what have i done ? forgive me !
after all you have done . it is the horrible power of the ring . i wish it had
never [???] never [???] been found . but don ' t mind me [???] sam . i must carry the burden to
the end . it can ' t be altered . you can ' t come between me and this doom . '
' that ' s all right [???] mr . [???] [???] ' said sam [???] rubbing his sleeve across his

eyes . ` i understand . but i can still help [???] can ' t i ? i ' ve got to get you out
of here . at once [???] see ! but first you want some clothes and gear and then
some food . the clothes will be the easiest part . as we ' re in [???] [???] we ' d [???]
best dress up [???] - fashion ; and anyway there isn ' t no choice . it ' ll have
to be orc - stuff for you [???] mr . [???] [???] i ' m afraid . and for me too . if we go
together [???] we ' d best match . now put this round you ! '
sam [???] his grey cloak and cast it about [???] ' s shoulders . then
[???] his pack he laid it on the floor . he drew sting from its sheath .
hardly a [???] was to be seen upon its blade . ` i was forgetting this [???] mr .
[???] [???] ' he said . ` no [???] they didn ' t get everything ! you lent me sting [???] if you
remember [???] and the lady ' s glass . i ' ve got them both still . but lend them to
me a little longer [???] mr . [???] . i must go and see what i can find . you stay
here . walk about a bit and ease your legs . i shan ' t be long . i shan ' t have
to go far . '
` take care [???] sam ! ' said [???] . ` and be quick ! there may be [???] still
alive [???] lurking in wait . '
' i ' ve got to chance it [???] ' said sam . he stepped to the trap - door and
slipped down the ladder . in a minute his head reappeared . he threw a long
knife on the floor .
` there ' s something that might be useful [???] ' he said . ' he ' s dead : the one
that whipped you . broke his neck [???] it seems [???] in his hurry . now you draw up
the ladder [???] if you can [???] mr . [???] ; and don ' t you let it down till you hear
me call the [???] . [???] i ' ll call . what the elves say . no orc would
say that . '

[???] sat for a while and shivered [???] dreadful fears chasing one another
through his mind . then he got up [???] drew the grey elven - cloak about him [???] and
to keep his mind occupied [???] began to walk to and fro [???] prying and peering into
every corner of his prison .
it was not very long [???] though fear made it seem an hour at least [???] before
he heard sam ' s voice calling softly from below : [???] [???] [???] . [???]
let down the light ladder . up came sam [???] puffing [???] heaving a great bundle on
his head . he let it fall with a thud .
` quick now . mr . [???] ! ' he said . ` i ' ve had a bit of a search to find
anything small enough for the likes of us . we ' ll have to make do . but we
must hurry . i ' ve met nothing alive [???] and i ' ve seen nothing but i ' m not easy .
i think this place is being watched . i can ' t explain it [???] but well : it feels

to me as if one of those foul flying riders was about [???] up in the blackness
where he can ' t be seen . '
he opened the bundle . [???] looked in disgust at the contents [???] but
there was nothing for it : he had to put the things on [???] or go naked . there
were long hairy breeches of some unclean beast - fell [???] and a tunic of dirty
leather . he drew them on . over the tunic went a coat of stout ring - mail [???]
short for a full - sized orc [???] too long for [???] and heavy . about it he
clasped a belt [???] at which there hung a short sheath holding a broad - bladed
stabbing - sword . sam had brought several orc - helmets . one of them fitted
[???] well enough [???] a black cap with iron rim [???] and iron hoops covered with
leather upon which the evil eye was painted in red above the [???]
nose - guard .
` the [???] - stuff [???] [???] ' s gear [???] was a better fit and better made [???] '
said sam ; ` but it wouldn ' t do [???] i guess [???] to go carrying his tokens into
[???] [???] not after this business here . well [???] there you are [???] mr . [???] . a
perfect little orc [???] if i may make so bold - at least you would be [???] if we could
cover your face with a mask [???] give you longer arms [???] and make you bow - legged .
this will hide some of the tell - tales . ' he put a large black cloak round
[???] ' s shoulders . ` now you ' re ready ! you can pick up a shield as we go . '
' what about you [???] sam ? ' said [???] . ` aren ' t we going to match ? '
` well [???] mr . [???] [???] i ' ve been thinking [???] ' said sam . ' i ' d best not leave
any of my stuff behind [???] and we can ' t destroy it . and i can ' t wear orc - mail
over all my clothes [???] can i ? i ' ll just have to cover up . '
he knelt down and carefully folded his elven - cloak . it went into a
surprisingly small roll . this he put into his pack that lay on the floor .
standing up [???] he slung it behind his back [???] put an orc - helm on his head [???] and
cast another black cloak about his shoulders . ` there ! ' he said . ` now we
match [???] near enough . and now we must be off ! '
' i can ' t go all the way at a run [???] sam [???] ' said [???] with a wry smile . ' i
hope you ' ve made [???] about inns along the road ? or have you forgotten
about food and drink ? '
` save me [???] but so i had ! ' said sam . he whistled in dismay . ' bless me [???]
mr . [???] [???] but you ' ve gone and made me that hungry and thirsty ! i don ' t know
when drop or morsel last passed my lips . i ' d forgotten it [???] trying to find
you . but let me think ! last time i looked i ' d got about enough of that
[???] [???] and of what captain [???] gave us [???] to keep me on my legs for a
couple of weeks at a pinch . but if there ' s a drop left in my bottle [???] there ' s

no more . that ' s not going to be enough for two [???] nohow . don ' t ores eat [???] and
don ' t they drink ? or do they just live on foul air and poison ? '
` no [???] they eat and drink [???] sam . the shadow that bred them can only mock [???]
it cannot make : not real new things of its own . i don ' t think it gave life
to the ores [???] it only ruined them and twisted them ; and if they are to live
at all [???] they have to live like other living creatures . foul waters and foul
meats they ' ll take [???] if they can get no better [???] but not poison . they ' ve fed
me [???] and so i ' m better off than you . there must be food and water somewhere
in this place . ' ` but there ' s no time to look for them [???] ' said sam .
` well [???] things are a bit better than you think [???] ' said [???] . ' i have had
a bit of luck while you were away . indeed they did not take everything . i ' ve
found my food - bag among some rags on the floor . they ' ve [???] it [???] of
course . but i guess they disliked the very look and smell of the [???] [???]
worse than [???] did . it ' s scattered about and some of it is trampled and
broken [???] but i ' ve gathered it together . it ' s not far short of what you ' ve
got . but they ' ve taken [???] ' s food [???] and they ' ve [???] up my
water - bottle . '
` well [???] there ' s no more to be said [???] ' said sam . ` we ' ve got enough to
start on . but the water ' s going to be a bad business . but come mr . [???] !
off we go [???] or a whole lake of it won ' t do us any good ! '
' not till you ' ve had a mouthful [???] sam [???] ' said [???] . ` i won ' t budge .
here [???] take this elven - cake [???] and drink that last drop in your bottle ! the
whole thing is quite hopeless [???] so it ' s no good [???] about tomorrow . it
probably won ' t come . '

at last they started . down the ladder they climbed [???] and then sam took
it and laid it in the passage beside the [???] body of the fallen orc . the
stair was dark [???] but on the roof - top the glare of the mountain could still be
seen [???] though it was dying down now to a sullen red . they picked up two
shields to complete their disguise and then went on .
down the great stairway they [???] . the high chamber of the turret
behind [???] where they had met again [???] seemed almost homely : they were out in the
open again now [???] and terror ran along the walls . all might be dead in the
tower of [???] ungol [???] but it was steeped in fear and evil still .
at length they came to the door upon the outer court [???] and they halted .
even from where they stood they felt the malice of the watchers beating on
them [???] black silent shapes on either side of the gate through which the glare

of [???] dimly showed . as they threaded their way among the hideous
bodies
of the ores each step became more difficult . before they even reached the
archway they were brought to a stand . to move an inch further was a pain and
weariness to will and limb .
[???] had no strength for such a battle . he sank to the ground . ` i
can ' t go on [???] sam [???] ' he murmured . ` i ' m going to faint . i don ' t know what ' s
come over me . '
` i do [???] mr . [???] . hold up now ! it ' s the gate . there ' s some devilry
there . but i got through [???] and i ' m going to get out . it can ' t be more
dangerous than before . now for it ! '
sam drew out the elven - glass of [???] again . as if to do honour to
his [???] [???] and to grace with [???] his faithful brown hobbit - hand
that had done such deeds [???] the phial blazed forth suddenly [???] so that all the
shadowy court was lit with a [???] radiance like lightning ; but it
remained steady and did not pass .
' [???] [???] a [???] ! ' sam cried . for [???] why he did not know [???] his
thought sprang back suddenly to the elves in the shire [???] and the song that
drove away the black rider in the trees .
' [???] [???] [???] ! ' cried [???] once again behind him .
the will of the watchers was broken with a suddenness like the snapping
of a cord [???] and [???] and sam [???] forward . then they ran . through the
gate and past the great seated figures with their glittering eyes . there was
a crack . the keystone of the arch [???] almost on their heels [???] and the
wall above [???] [???] and fell in ruin . only by a hair did they escape . a
bell clanged ; and from the watchers there went up a high and dreadful wail .
far up above in the darkness it was answered . out of the black sky there
came dropping like a bolt a winged shape [???] rending the clouds with a ghastly
shriek .




chapter 2 . the land of shadow



sam had just wits enough left to thrust the phial back into his breast .
' run [???] mr . [???] ! ' he cried . ' no [???] not that way ! there ' s a sheer drop over the
wall . follow me ! '
down the road from the gate they fled . in fifty paces [???] with a swift
bend round a [???] bastion of the cliff [???] it took them out of sight from
the tower . they had escaped for the moment . cowering back against the rock
they drew breath [???] and then they clutched at their hearts . perching now on
the wall beside the ruined gate the [???] sent out its deadly cries . all
the cliffs echoed .
in terror they [???] on . soon the road bent sharply eastward again
and exposed them for a dreadful moment to view from the tower . as they
flitted across they glanced back and saw the great black shape upon the
battlement ; then they [???] down between high rock - walls in a cu tting that
fell steeply to join the [???] - road . they came to the way - meeting . there
was still no sign of [???] [???] nor of an answer to the cry of the [???] ; but
they knew that the silence would not last long . at any moment now the hunt
would begin .
' this won ' t do [???] sam [???] ' said [???] . ' if we were real [???] [???] we ought to be
dashing back to the tower [???] not running away . the first enemy we meet will
know us . we must get off this road somehow . '
' but we can ' t [???] ' said sam [???] ' not without wings . '
the eastern faces of the [???] d [???] ath were sheer [???] falling in cliff and
[???] to the black trough that lay between them and the inner ridge . a
short way beyond the way - meeting [???] after another steep incline [???] a flying
bridge of stone leapt over the chasm and bore the road across into the
tumbled [???] and glens of the [???] . with a desperate spurt [???] and sam
dashed along the bridge ; but they had hardly reached its further end when
they heard the hue and cry begin . away behind them [???] now high above on the
mountain - side [???] loomed the tower of [???] ungol [???] its stones glowing dully .
suddenly its harsh bell clanged again [???] and then broke into a [???]
peal . horns sounded . and now from beyond the bridge - end came
answering
cries . down in the dark trough [???] cut off from the dying glare of [???] [???]

[???] and sam could not see ahead [???] but already they heard the tramp of
iron - shod feet [???] and upon the road there rang the swift clatter of [???] .
' quick [???] sam ! over we go ! ' cried [???] . they [???] on to the low
[???] of the bridge . fortunately there was no longer any dreadful drop
into the gulf [???] for the [???] of the [???] had already risen almost to the
level of the road ; but it was too dark for them to guess the depth of the
fall .
' well [???] here goes [???] mr . [???] [???] ' said sam . ' good - bye ! '
he let go . [???] followed . and even as they fell they heard the rush of
horsemen sweeping over the bridge and the rattle of orc - feet running up
behind . but sam would have laughed [???] if he had dared . half fearing a breaking
[???] down on to unseen rocks the [???] landed [???] in a drop of no more than
a dozen feet [???] with a thud and a crunch into the last thing that they had
expected : a tangle of thorny bushes . there sam lay still [???] softly sucking a
scratched hand .
when the sound of hoof and foot had passed he ventured a whisper .
' bless me [???] mr . [???] [???] but i didn ' t know as anything grew in [???] ! but if i
had a ' known [???] this is just what i ' d have looked for . these thorns must be a
foot long by the feel of them ; they ' ve stuck through everything i ' ve got on .
wish i ' d a ' put that mail - shirt on ! '
' orc - mail doesn ' t keep these thorns out [???] ' said [???] . ' not even a
leather jerkin is any good . '
they had a struggle to get out of the thicket . the thorns and briars
were as tough as wire and as [???] as claws . their cloaks were rent and
[???] before they broke free at last .
' now down we go [???] sam [???] ' [???] whispered . ' down into the valley quick [???]
and then turn northward [???] as soon as ever we can . '
day was coming again in the world outside [???] and far beyond the [???] of
[???] the sun was climbing over the eastern rim of middle - earth ; but here
all was still dark as night . the mountain [???] ed and its fires went out .
the glare faded from the cliffs . the [???] wind that had been blowing
ever since they left [???] now seemed dead . slowly and painfully they
[???] down [???] groping [???] stumbling [???] [???] among rock and briar and
dead
wood in the blind shadows [???] down and down until they could go no further .
at length they stopped [???] and sat side by side [???] their backs against a
[???] . both were sweating . ' if [???] himself was to offer me a glass of

water [???] i ' d shake his hand [???] ' said sam .
' don ' t say such things ! ' said [???] . ' it only makes it worse . ' then he
stretched himself out [???] [???] and weary [???] and he spoke no more for a while . at
last with a struggle he got up again . to his amazement he found that sam was
asleep . ' wake up [???] sam ! ' he said . ' come on ! it ' s time we made another
effort . '
sam [???] to his feet . ' well i never ! ' he said . ' i must have
dropped off . it ' s a long time [???] mr . [???] [???] since i had a proper sleep [???] and my
eyes just closed down on their own . '
[???] now led the way [???] northward as near as he could guess [???] among the
stones and [???] lying thick at the bottom of the great ravine . but
presently he stopped again .
' it ' s no good [???] sam [???] ' he said . ' i can ' t manage it . this mail - shirt [???] i
mean . not in my present state . even my [???] - coat seemed heavy when i was
tired . this is far heavier . and what ' s the use of it ? we shan ' t win through
by fighting . '
' but we may have some to do [???] ' said sam . ' and there ' s knives and stray
arrows . that [???] isn ' t dead [???] for one thing . i don ' t like to think of you
with naught but a bit of leather between you and a stab in the dark . '
' look here [???] sam dear lad [???] ' said [???] : ' i am tired [???] weary [???] i haven ' t a
hope left . but i have to go on trying to get to the mountain [???] as long as i
can move . the ring is enough . this extra weight is killing me . it must go .
but don ' t think i ' m [???] . i hate to think of the foul work you must
have had among the bodies to find it for me . '
' don ' t talk about it [???] mr . [???] . bless you ! i ' d carry you on my back [???]
if i could . let it go then ! '
[???] laid aside his cloak and took off the orc - mail and flung it away .
he shivered a little . ' what i really need is something warm [???] ' he said . ' it ' s
gone cold [???] or else i ' ve caught a chill . '
' you can have my cloak [???] mr . [???] [???] ' said sam . he [???] his pack and
took out the elven - cloak . ' how ' s this [???] mr . [???] ? ' he said . ' you wrap that
orc - rag close round you [???] and put the belt outside it . then this can go over
all . it don ' t look quite orc - fashion [???] but it ' ll keep you warmer ; and i
daresay it ' ll keep you from harm better than any other gear . it was made by
the lady . '
[???] took the cloak and fastened the brooch . ' that ' s better ! ' he said .
' i feel much lighter . i can go on now . but this blind dark seems to be

getting into my heart . as i lay in prison [???] sam . i tried to remember the
[???] [???] and woody end [???] and the water running through the mill at
[???] . but i can ' t see them now . '
' there now [???] mr . [???] [???] it ' s you that ' s talking of water this time ! '
said sam . ' if only the lady could see us or hear us [???] i ' d say to her : ( your
ladyship [???] all we want is light and water : just clean water and plain
daylight [???] better than any jewels [???] begging your pardon . ( but it ' s a long way
to [???] . ' sam sighed and waved his hand towards the heights of the [???]
d [???] ath [???] now only to be guessed as a deeper blackness against the black sky .

they started off again . they had not gone far when [???] paused .
' there ' s a black rider over us [???] ' he said . ' i can feel it . we had better keep
still for a while . '
[???] under a great [???] they sat facing back westward and did
not speak for some time . then [???] breathed a sigh of relief . ' it ' s
passed [???] ' he said . they stood up [???] and then they both stared in wonder . away
to their left [???] southward [???] against a sky that was turning grey [???] the peaks and
high ridges of the great range began to appear dark and black [???] visible
shapes . light was growing behind them . slowly it crept towards the north .
there was battle far above in the high spaces of the air . the [???]
clouds of [???] were being driven back [???] their edges [???] as a wind out
of the living world came up and swept the fumes and smokes towards the dark
land of their home . under the lifting skirts of the dreary canopy dim light
leaked into [???] like pale morning through the grimed window of a prison .
' look at it [???] mr . [???] ! ' said sam . ' look at it ! the wind ' s changed .
something ' s happening . he ' s not having it all his own way . his darkness is
breaking up out in the world there . i wish i could see what is going on ! '
it was the morning of the fifteenth of march [???] and over the vale of
[???] the sun was rising above the eastern shadow [???] and the south - west wind
was blowing . [???] lay dying on the [???] fields .
as [???] and sam stood and gazed [???] the rim of light spread all along the
line of the [???] d [???] ath [???] and then they saw a shape [???] moving at a great speed
out of the west [???] at first only a black speck against the [???] strip
above the mountain - tops [???] but growing [???] until it [???] like a bolt into the
dark canopy and passed high above them . as it went it sent out a long shrill
cry [???] the voice of a [???] ; but this cry no longer held any terror for them :
it was a cry of woe and dismay [???] ill tidings for the dark tower . the lord of

the ring - [???] had met his doom .
' what did i tell you ? something ' s happening ! ' cried sam . ' ( the war ' s
going well [???] ( said [???] ; but [???] he wasn ' t so sure . and he was right
there too . things are looking up [???] mr . [???] . haven ' t you got some hope now ? '
' well no [???] not much [???] sam [???] ' [???] sighed . ' that ' s away beyond the
mountains . we ' re going east not west . and i ' m so tired . and the ring is so
heavy [???] sam . and i begin to see it in my mind all the time [???] like a great
wheel of fire . '
sam ' s quick spirits sank again at once . he looked at his master
anxiously [???] and he took his hand . ' come [???] mr . [???] ! ' he said . ' i ' ve got one
thing i wanted : a bit of light . enough to help us [???] and yet i guess it ' s
dangerous too . try a bit further [???] and then we ' ll lie close and have a rest .
but take a morsel to eat now [???] a bit of the e lves ' food ; it may hearten you . '
sharing a wafer of [???] [???] and [???] it as best they could with
their parched mouths . [???] and sam [???] on . the light [???] though no more
than a grey [???] [???] was now enough for them to see that they were deep in the
valley between the mountains . it [???] up gently northward [???] and at its
bottom went the bed of a now dry and withered stream . beyond its stony
course they saw a beaten path that wound its way under the feet of the
westward cliffs . had they known [???] they could have reached it quicker [???] for it
was a track that left the main [???] - road at the western bridge - end and
went down by a long stair cut in the rock to the valley ' s bottom . it was
used by patrols or by messengers going swiftly to lesser posts and
[???] north - away [???] between [???] ungol and the narrows of [???] [???]
the iron jaws of carach angren .
it was perilous for the [???] to use such a path [???] but they needed
speed [???] and [???] felt that he could not face the toil of [???] among
the [???] or in the trackless glens of the [???] . and he judged that
northward was [???] maybe [???] the way that their hunters would least expect them to
take . the road east to the plain [???] or the pass back westward [???] those they
would first search most thoroughly . only when he was well north of the tower
did he mean to turn and seek for some way to take him east [???] east on the last
desperate stage of his journey . so now they crossed the stony bed and took
to the orc - path [???] and for some time they marched along it . the cliffs at
their left were [???] [???] and they could not be seen from above ; but the
path made many bends [???] and at each bend they gripped their sword - [???] and
went forward [???] .

the light grew no stronger [???] for [???] was still belching forth a
great fume that [???] beaten upwards by the opposing airs [???] mounted higher and
higher [???] until it reached a region above the wind and spread in an
[???] roof [???] whose central pillar rose out of the shadows beyond their
view . they had [???] for more than an hour when they heard a sound that
brought them to a halt . [???] [???] but [???] . water trickling . out
of a gully on the left [???] so sharp and narrow that it look ed as if the black
cliff had been cloven by some huge axe [???] water came dripping down : the last
remains [???] maybe [???] of some sweet rain gathered from [???] seas [???] but ill - fated
to fall at last upon the walls of the black land and wander fruitless down
into the dust . here it came out of the rock in a little falling streamlet [???]
and flowed across the path [???] and turning south ran away swiftly to be lost
among the dead stones .
sam sprang towards it . ' if ever i see the lady again [???] i will tell her ! '
he cried . ' light and now water ! ' then he stopped . ' let me drink first mr .
[???] [???] ' he said .
' all right [???] but there ' s room enough for two . '
' i didn ' t mean that [???] ' said sam . ' i mean : if it ' s poisonous [???] or
something that will show its badness quick [???] well [???] better me than you [???]
master [???] if you understand me . '
' i do . but i think we ' ll trust our luck together [???] sam ; or our blessing .
still [???] be careful now [???] if it ' s very cold ! '
the water was cool but not icy [???] and it had an [???] taste [???] a t once
bitter and oily [???] or so they would have said at home . here it seemed beyond
all praise [???] and beyond fear or [???] . they drank their fill [???] and sam
[???] his water - bottle . after that [???] felt easier [???] and they went on
for several miles [???] until the broadening of the road and the beginnings of a
rough wall along its edge warned them that they were drawing near to another
orc - hold .
' this is where we turn aside [???] sam [???] ' said [???] . ' and we must turn
east . ' he sighed as he looked a t the gloomy ridges across the valley . ' i
have just about enough strength left to find some hole away up there . and
then i must rest a little . '
the river - bed was now some way below the path . they [???] down to
it [???] and began to cross it . to their surprise they came upon dark [???] fed
by threads of water trickling down from some source higher up the valley .

upon its outer marges under the westward mountains [???] was a dying
land [???]
but it was not yet dead . and here things still grew [???] harsh [???] twisted [???] bitter [???]
struggling for life . in the glens of the [???] on the other side of the
valley low [???] trees lurked and clung [???] coarse grey grass - [???] fought
with the stones [???] and withered mosses [???] on them ; and everywhere great
[???] [???] tangled [???] [???] . some had long stabbing thorns [???] some
hooked barbs that rent like knives . the sullen [???] leaves of a past
year hung on them [???] grating and rattling in the sad airs [???] but their
[???] - ridden buds were only just opening . flies [???] dun or grey [???] or black [???]
marked like ores with a red eye - shaped blotch [???] buzzed and stung ; and above
the briar - thickets clouds of hungry midges danced and [???] .
' orc - gear ' s no good [???] ' said sam [???] waving his arms . ' i wish i ' d got an
orc ' s hide ! '
at last [???] could go no further . they had climbed up a narrow
shelving ravine [???] but they still had a long way to go before they could even
come in sight of the last [???] ridge . ' i must rest now [???] sam [???] and sleep if
i can . ' said [???] . he looked about [???] but there seemed nowhere even for an
animal to [???] into in this dismal country . at length [???] tired out [???] they
slunk under a curtain of [???] that hung down like a mat over a low
rock - face .
there they sat and made such a meal as they could . keeping back the
precious [???] for the evil days ahead [???] they ate the half of what remained
in sam ' s bag of [???] ' s provision : some dried fruit [???] and a small slip of
cured meat ; and they sipped some water . they had drunk again from the [???]
in the valley [???] but they were very [???] thirsty again . there was a bitter tang in
the air of [???] that dried the mouth . when sam thought of water even his
hopeful spirit [???] . beyond the [???] there was the dreadful plain of
[???] to cross .
' now you go to sleep first [???] mr . [???] [???] ' he said . ' it ' s getting dark
again . i reckon this day is nearly over . '
[???] sighed and was asleep almost before the words were spoken . sam
struggled with his own weariness [???] and he took [???] ' s hand ; and there he sat
silent till deep night fell . then at last [???] to keep himself awake [???] he [???]
from the hiding - place and looked out . the land seemed full of creaking and
cracking and sly noises [???] but there was no sound of voice or of foot . far
above the [???] d [???] ath in the west the night - sky was still dim and pale .

there [???] peeping among the cloud - wrack above a dark tor high up in the
mountains [???] sam saw a white star [???] for a while . the beauty of it smote
his heart [???] as he looked up out of the forsaken land [???] and hope returned to
him . for like a shaft [???] clear and cold [???] the thought pierced him that in the
end the shadow was only a small and passing thing : there was light and high
beauty for ever beyond its reach . his song in the tower had been defiance
rather than hope ; for then he was thinking of himself . now [???] for a moment [???]
his own fate [???] and even his masters [???] ceased to trouble him . he [???] back
into the [???] and laid himself by [???] ' s side [???] and putting away all
fear he cast himself into a deep [???] sleep .
they woke together [???] hand in hand . sam was almost fresh [???] ready for
another day ; but [???] sighed . his sleep had been uneasy [???] full of dreams of
fire [???] and waking brought him no comfort . still his sleep had not been
without all healing virtue : he was stronger [???] more able to bear his burden
one stage further . they did not know the time [???] nor how long they had slept ;
but after a morsel of food and a sip of water they went on up the ravine [???]
until it ended in a sharp slope of screes and sliding stones . there the last
living things gave up their struggle ; the tops of the [???] were grassless [???]
bare [???] jagged [???] barren as a slate .
after much wandering and search they found a way that they could climb [???]
and with a last hundred feet of [???] scramble they were up . they came to
a cleft between two dark crags [???] and passing through found themselves on the
very edge of the last fence of [???] . below them [???] at the bottom of a fall
of some fifteen hundred feet [???] lay the inner plain stretching away into a
formless gloom beyond their sight . the wind of the world blew now from the
west [???] and the great clouds were lifted high [???] floating away eastward ; but
still only a grey light came to the dreary fields of [???] . there smokes
trailed on the ground and lurked in hollows [???] and fumes leaked from [???]
in the earth .
still far away [???] forty miles at least [???] they saw mount doom [???] its feet
founded in ashen ruin [???] its huge cone rising to a great height [???] where its
reeking head was [???] in cloud . its fires were now dimmed [???] and it stood
in [???] slumber [???] as threatening and dangerous as a sleeping beast .
behind it there hung a vast shadow [???] [???] as a thunder - cloud [???] the veils of
barad - dyr that was reared far way upon a long spur of the ashen mountains
thrust down from the north . the dark power was deep in thought [???] and the eye
turned inward [???] pondering tidings of doubt and danger : a bright sword [???] and a

stern and kingly face it saw [???] and for a while it gave little thought to
other things ; and all its great stronghold [???] gate on gate [???] and tower on
tower [???] was wrapped in a brooding gloom .
[???] and sam gazed out in mingled loathing and wonder on this hateful
land . between them and the smoking mountain [???] and about it north and south [???]
all seemed ruinous and dead [???] a desert burned and choked . they wondered
how
the lord of this realm maintained and fed his slaves and his armies . yet
armies he had . as far as their eyes could reach [???] along the skirts of the
[???] and away southward [???] there were camps [???] some of tents [???] some ordered
like small towns . one of the largest of these was right below them . barely a
mile out into the plain it [???] like some huge nest of [???] [???] with
straight dreary streets of huts and long low drab buildings . about it the
ground was busy with folk going to and fro ; a wide road ran from it
south - east to join the [???] - way [???] and along it many lines of small black
shapes were hurrying .
' i don ' t like the look of things at all [???] ' said sam . ' pretty hopeless [???] i
call it - saving that where there ' s such a lot of folk there must be wells
or water [???] not to mention food . and these are men not [???] [???] or my eyes are
all wrong . '
neither he nor [???] knew anything of the great slave - worked fields
away south in this wide realm [???] beyond the fumes of the mountain by the dark
sad waters of lake n [???] [???] ; nor of the great roads that ran away east and
south to [???] lands [???] from which the soldiers of the tower brought long
waggon - trains of goods and booty and fresh slaves . here in the northward
regions were the mines and forges [???] and the musterings of long - planned war ;
and here the dark power [???] moving its armies like pieces on the board [???] was
gathering them together . its first moves [???] the first feelers of its strength [???]
had been checked upon its western line [???] southward and northward . for the
moment it withdrew them [???] and brought up new forces [???] massing them about
[???] [???] for an avenging stroke . and if it had also been its purpose to
defend the mountain against all approach [???] it could scarcely have done more .
' well ! ' sam went on . ' whatever they have to eat and drink [???] we can ' t get
it . there ' s no way down that i can see . and we couldn ' t cross all that open
country [???] with enemies [???] even if we did get down . '
' still we shall have to try [???] ' said [???] . ' it ' s no worse than i
expected . i never hoped to get across . i can ' t see any hope of it now . but

i ' ve still got to do the best i can . at present that is to avoid being
captured as long as possible . so we must still go northwards [???] i think [???] and
see what it is like where the open plain is narrower . '
' i guess what it ' ll be like [???] ' said sam . ' where it ' s narrower the [???]
and men will just be packed closer . you ' ll see [???] mr . [???] . '
' i dare say i shall [???] if we ever get so far [???] ' said [???] and turned
away .
they soon found that it was impossible to make their way along the
crest of the [???] [???] or anywhere along its higher levels [???] pathless as they
were and scored with deep [???] . in the end they were forced to go back
down the ravine that they had climbed and seek for a way along the valley .
it was rough going [???] for they dared not cross over to the path on the
westward side . after a mile or more they saw [???] [???] in a hollow at the
cliff ' s foot [???] the orc - hold that they had guessed was near at hand : a wall
and a [???] of stone huts set about the dark mouth of a cave . there was no
movement to be seen [???] but the [???] crept by [???] [???] keeping as much as
they could to the thorn - brakes that grew thickly at this point along both
sides of the old water - course .
they went two or three miles further [???] and the orc - hold was hidden from
sight behind them ; but they had hardly begun to breathe more freely again
when harsh and loud they heard orc - voices . quickly they slunk out of sight
behind a brown and [???] bush . the voices drew nearer . presently two [???]
came into view . one was clad in ragged brown and was armed with a bow of
horn ; it was of a small breed [???] black - skinned [???] with wide and snuffling
[???] : evidently a tracker of some kind . the other was a big
fighting - orc [???] like those of [???] ' s company [???] bearing the token of the eye .
he also had a bow at his back and carried a short broad - headed spear . as
usual they were quarrelling [???] and being of different breeds they used the
common speech a fter their fashion .
hardly twenty paces from where the [???] lurked the small orc
stopped . ' nar ! ' it [???] . ' i ' m going home . ' it pointed across the valley
to the orc - hold . ' no good wearing my nose out on stones any more . there ' s
not a trace left [???] i say . i ' ve lost the scent through giving way to you . it
went up into the hills [???] not along the valley [???] i tell you . '
' not much use are you [???] you little snufflers ? ' said the big orc . ' i
reckon eyes are better than your [???] noses . '
' then what have you seen with them ? ' [???] the other . ' garn ! you

don ' t even know what you ' re looking for . '
' whose blame ' s that ? ' said the soldier . ' not mine . that comes from
higher up . first they say it ' s a great elf in bright armour [???] then it ' s a
sort of small dwarf - man [???] then it must be a pack of rebel [???] - hai ; or maybe
it ' s all the lot together . '
' ar ! ' said the tracker . ' they ' ve lost their heads [???] that ' s what it is .
and some of the bosses are going to lose their skins too [???] i guess [???] if what i
hear is true : tower raided and all [???] and hundreds of your lads done in [???] and
prisoner got away . if that ' s the way you fighters go on [???] small wonder
there ' s bad news from the battles . '
' who says there ' s bad news ? ' shouted the soldier .
' ar ! who says there isn ' t ? '
' that ' s cursed rebel - talk [???] and i ' ll stick you [???] if you don ' t shut it
down [???] see ? '
' all right [???] all right ! ' said the tracker . ' i ' ll say no more and go on
thinking . but what ' s the black sneak got to do with it all ? that [???]
with the flapping hands ? '
' i don ' t know . nothing [???] maybe . but he ' s up to no good [???] nosing around [???]
i ' ll wager . curse him ! no sooner had he slipped us and run off than word
came he ' s wanted alive [???] wanted quick . '
' well [???] i hope they get him and put him through it [???] ' growled the
tracker . ' he messed up the scent back there [???] pinching that cast - off
mail - shirt that he found [???] and paddling all round the place before i could
get there . '
' it saved his life anyhow [???] ' said the soldier . ' why [???] before i knew he
was wanted i shot him [???] as neat as neat [???] at fifty paces right in the back ;
but he ran on . '
' garn ! you missed him [???] ' said the tracker . ' first you shoot wild [???] then
you run too slow [???] and then you send for the poor trackers . i ' ve had enough
of you . ' he loped off .
' you come back [???] ' shouted the soldier [???] ' or i ' ll report you ! '
' who to ? not to your precious [???] . he won ' t be captain any more . '
' i ' ll give your name and number to the [???] [???] ' said the soldier
lowering his voice to a hiss . ' one of them ' s in charge at the tower now . '
the other halted [???] and his voice was full of fear and rage . ' you cursed
[???] [???] ! ' he yelled . ' you can ' t do your job [???] and you can ' t even
stick by your own folk . go to your filthy shriekers [???] and may they freeze the

flesh off you ! if the enemy doesn ' t get them first . they ' ve done in number
one [???] i ' ve heard [???] and i hope it ' s true ! '
the big orc [???] spear in hand [???] leapt after him . but the tracker [???] springing
behind a stone [???] put an arrow in his eye as he ran up [???] and he fell with a
crash . the other ran off across the valley and disappeared .
for a while the [???] sat in silence . at length sam stirred . ' well i
call that neat as neat [???] ' he said . ' if this nice friendliness would spread
about in [???] [???] half our trouble would be over . '
' quietly [???] sam [???] ' [???] whispered . ' there may be others about . we have
evidently had a very narrow escape [???] and the hunt was hotter on our tracks
than we guessed . but that is the spirit of [???] [???] sam ; and it has spread to
every corner of it . [???] have always behaved like that [???] or so all tales say [???]
when they are on their own . but you can ' t get much hope out of it . they hate
us far more [???] altogether and all the time . if those two had seen us [???] they
would have dropped all their quarrel until we were dead . '
there was another long silence . sam broke it again [???] but with a whisper
this time . ' did you hear what they said about that [???] [???] mr . [???] ? i
told you [???] wasn ' t dead yet [???] didn ' t i ? '
' yes [???] i remember . and i wondered how you knew [???] ' said [???] . ' well come
now ! i think we had better not move out from here again [???] until it has gone
quite dark . so you shall tell me how you know [???] a nd all about what happened .
if you can do it quietly . '
' i ' ll try [???] ' said sam [???] ' but when i think of that [???] i get so hot l
could shout . '
there the [???] sat under the cover of the thorny bush [???] while the
drear light of [???] faded slowly into a deep and starless night ; and sam
spoke into [???] ' s ear all that he could find words for of [???] ' s
treacherous attack [???] the horror of [???] [???] and his own adventures with the
[???] . when he had finished [???] [???] said nothing but took sam ' s hand and
pressed it . at length he stirred .
' well [???] i suppose we must be going on again [???] ' he said . ' i wonder how
long it will be before we really are caught and all the toiling and the
slinking will be over [???] and in vain . ' he stood up . ' it ' s dark [???] and we cannot
use the lady ' s glass . keep it safe for me [???] sam . i have nowhere to keep it
now [???] except in my hand [???] and i shall need both hands in the blind night . but
sting i give to you . i have got an orc - blade [???] but i do not think it will be
my part to strike any blow again . '

it was difficult and dangerous moving in the night in the pathless
land ; but slowly and with much stumbling the two [???] toiled on hour by
hour northward along the eastern edge of the stony valley . when a grey light
crept back over the western heights [???] long after day had opened in the lands
beyond [???] they went into hiding again and slept a little [???] turn by turn . in his
times of waking sam was busy with thoughts of food . at last when [???]
roused himself and spoke of eating and making ready for yet another effort [???]
he asked the question that was troubling him most .
' begging your pardon [???] mr . [???] [???] ' he said [???] ' but have you any notion how
far there is still to go ? '
' no [???] not any clear notion [???] sam [???] ' [???] answered . ' in [???] before i
set out i was shown a map of [???] that was made before the enemy came
back
here ; but i only remember it vaguely . i remember clearest that there was a
place in the north where the western range and the northern range send out
spurs that nearly meet . that must be twenty leagues at least from the bridge
back by the tower . it might be a good point at which to cross . but of
course [???] if we get there [???] we shall be further than we were from the mountain [???]
sixty miles from it [???] i should think . i guess that we have gone about twelve
leagues north from the bridge now . even if all goes well [???] i could hardly
reach the mountain in a week . i am afraid [???] sam [???] that the burden will get
very heavy [???] and i shall go still slower as we get nearer . '
sam sighed . ' that ' s just as i feared [???] ' he said . ' well [???] to say nothing
of water [???] we ' ve got to eat less [???] mr . [???] [???] or else move a bit quicker [???] at
any rate while we ' re still in this valley . one more bite and all the food ' s
ended [???] save the elves ' [???] . '
' i ' ll try and be a bit quicker [???] sam [???] ' said [???] [???] drawing a deep
breath . ' come on then ! let ' s start another march ! '
it was not yet quite dark again . they [???] along [???] on into the night .
the hours passed in a weary stumbling trudge with a few brief halts . at the
first hint of grey light under the skirts of the canopy of shadow they hid
themselves again in a dark hollow under an [???] stone .
slowly the light grew [???] until it was clearer than it yet had been . a
strong wind from the west was now driving the fumes of [???] from the
upper
airs . before long the [???] could make out the shape of the land for some
miles about them . the trough between the mountains and the [???] had

steadily [???] as it climbed upwards [???] and the inner ridge was now no more
than a shelf in the steep faces of the [???] d [???] ath ; but to the east it fell
as [???] as ever down into [???] . ahead the water - course came to an
end in broken steps of rock ; for out from the main range there sprang a high
barren spur [???] thrusting eastward like a wall . to meet it there stretched out
from the grey and misty northern range of ered [???] a long [???] arm ;
and between the ends there was a narrow gap : carach angren [???] the [???] [???]
beyond which lay the deep dale of [???] . in that dale behind the [???]
were the [???] and deep armouries that the servants of [???] had made for
the defence of the black gate of their land ; and there now their lord was
gathering in haste great forces to meet the [???] of the captains of the
west . upon the out - thrust spurs forts and towers were built [???] and watch - fires
burned ; and all across the gap an earth - wall had been raised [???] and a deep
trench delved that could be crossed only by a single bridge .
a few miles north [???] high up in the angle where the western spur branched
away from the main range [???] stood the old castle of [???] [???] now one of the
many orc - holds that [???] about the dale of [???] . a road [???] already
visible in the growing light [???] came winding down from it [???] until only a mile
or two from where the [???] lay it turned east and ran along a shelf cut
in the side of the spur [???] and so went down into the plain [???] and on to the
[???] .
to the [???] as they looked out it seemed that all their journey
north had been useless . the plain to their right was dim and smoky [???] and they
could see there neither camps nor troops moving ; but all that region was
under the [???] of the for ts of carach angren .
' we have come to a dead end [???] sam [???] ' said [???] . ' if we go on [???] we shall
only come up to that orc - tower [???] but the only road to take is that road that
comes down from it - unless we go back . we can ' t climb up westward [???] or climb
down eastward . '
' then we must take the road [???] mr . [???] [???] ' said sam . ' we must take it and
chance our luck [???] if there is any luck in [???] . we might as well give
ourselves up as wander about any more [???] or try to go back . our food won ' t
last . we ' ve got to make a dash for it ! '
' all right [???] sam [???] ' said [???] . ' lead me ! as long as you ' ve got any hope
left . mine is gone . but i can ' t dash [???] sam . i ' ll just plod along after you . '
' before you start any more [???] [???] you need sleep and food [???] mr .
[???] . come and take what you can get of them ! '

he gave [???] water and an additional wafer of the [???] [???] and he
made a pillow of his cloak for his master ' s head . [???] was too weary to
debate the matter [???] and sam did not tell him that he had drunk the last drop
of their water [???] and eaten sam ' s share of the food as well as his own . when
[???] was asleep sam bent over him and listened to his breathing and [???]
his face . it was lined and thin [???] and yet in sleep it looked content and
[???] . ' well [???] here goes [???] master ! ' sam muttered to himself . ' i ' ll have to
leave you for a bit and trust to luck . water we must have [???] or we ' ll get no
further . '
sam crept out [???] and flitting from stone to stone with more than
hobbit - care [???] he went down to the water - course [???] and then followed it for some
way as it climbed north [???] until he came to the rock - steps where long ago [???] no
doubt [???] its spring had come [???] down in a little waterfall . all now
seemed dry and silent ; but refusing to despair sam stooped and listened [???] and
to his delight he caught the sound of trickling . [???] a few steps up
he found a tiny stream of dark water that came out from the hill - side and
filled a little bare pool [???] from which again it spilled [???] and vanished then
under the barren stones .
sam tasted the water [???] and it seemed good enough . then he drank deeply [???]
refilled the bottle [???] and turned to go back . at that moment he caught a
glimpse of a black form or shadow flitting among the rocks away near [???] ' s
hiding - place . biting back a cry [???] he leapt down from the spring and ran [???]
jumping from stone to stone . it was a wary creature [???] difficult to see [???] but
sam had little doubt about it : he longed to get his hands on its neck . but
it heard him coming and slipped quickly away . sam thought he saw a last
fleeting glimpse of it [???] peering back over the edge of the eastward
[???] [???] before it ducked and disappeared .
' well [???] luck did not let me down [???] ' muttered sam [???] ' but that was a near
thing ! isn ' t it enough to have [???] by the thousand without that stinking
villain coming nosing round ? i wish he had been shot ! ' he sat down by [???]
and did not rouse him ; but he did not dare to go to sleep himself . at last
when he felt his eyes closing and knew that his struggle to keep awake could
not go on much longer [???] he wakened [???] gently .
' that [???] ' s about again [???] i ' m afraid [???] mr . [???] [???] ' he said .
' leastways [???] if it wasn ' t him [???] then there ' s two of him . i went away to find
some water and spied him nosing round just as i turned back . i reckon it
isn ' t safe for us both to sleep together [???] and begging your pardon [???] but i

can ' t hold up my lids much longer . '
' bless you [???] sam ! ' said [???] . ' lie down and take your pr oper turn ! but
i ' d rather have [???] than [???] . at any rate he won ' t give us away to them
- not unless he ' s caught himself . '
' but he might do a bit of robbery and murder on his own [???] ' growled sam .
' keep your eyes open [???] mr . [???] ! there ' s a bottle full of water . drink up .
we can fill it again when we go on . ' with that sam [???] into sleep .
light was fading when he woke . [???] sat propped against the rock
behind [???] but he had fallen asleep . the water - bottle was empty . there was no
sign of [???] .
[???] - dark had returned [???] and the watch - fires on the heights burned
fierce and red [???] when the [???] set out again on the most dangerous stage
of all their journey . they went first to the little spring [???] and then
climbing warily up they came to the road at the point where it swung east
towards the [???] twenty miles away . it was not a broad road [???] and it
had no wall or [???] along the edge and as it ran on the sheer drop from
its brink became deeper and deeper . the [???] could hear no movements [???] and
after listening for a while they set off eastward at a steady pace .
after doing some twelve miles [???] they halted . a short way back the road
had bent a little northward and the stretch that they had passed over was
now screened from sight . this proved [???] . they rested for some
minutes and then went on ; but they had not taken many steps when suddenly in
the stillness of the night they heard the sound that all along they had
secretly dreaded : the noise of marching feet . it was still some way behind
them [???] but looking back they could see the [???] of torches coming round
the bend less than a mile away [???] and they were moving fast : too fast for
[???] to escape by flight along the road ahead .
' i feared it [???] sam [???] ' said [???] . ' we ' ve trusted to luck [???] and it has
failed us . we ' re trapped . ' he looked wildly up at the frowning wall [???] where
the road - builders of old had cut the rock sheer for many fathoms above their
heads . he ran to the other side and looked over the brink into a dark pit of
gloom . ' we ' re trapped at last ! ' he said he sank to the ground beneath the
wall of rock and bowed his head .
' seems so [???] ' said sam . ' well [???] we can but wait and see . ' and with that he
sat down beside [???] under the shadow of the cliff .
they did not have to wait long . the [???] were going at a great pace .
those in the foremost files bore torches . on they came [???] red flames in the

dark [???] swiftly growing . now sam too bowed his head [???] hoping that it would hide
his face when the torches reached them ; and he set their shields before
their knees to hide their feet .
' if only they are in a hurry and will let a couple of tired soldiers
alone and pass on ! ' he thought .
and so it seemed that they would . the leading [???] came loping along [???]
panting [???] holding their heads down . they were a gang of the smaller breeds
being driven unwilling to their dark lord ' s wars ; all they cared for was to
get the march over and escape the whip . beside them [???] running up and down the
line [???] went two of the large fierce [???] [???] cracking [???] and shouting . file
after file passed [???] and the tell - tale torchlight was already some way ahead .
sam held his breath . now more than half the line had gone by . then suddenly
one of the slave - drivers spied the two figures by the road - side . he [???]
a whip at them and yelled : ' hi [???] you ! get up ! ' they did not answer [???] and with
a shout he halted the whole company .
' come on [???] you slugs ! ' he cried . ' this is no time for sl [???] . ' he
took a step towards them [???] and even in the gloom he recognized the devices on
their shields . ' deserting [???] eh ? ' he [???] . ' or thinking of it ? all your
folk should have been inside [???] before yesterday evening . you know that .
up you get and fall in [???] or i ' ll have your numbers and report you . '
they struggled to their feet [???] and keeping bent [???] limping like [???]
soldiers [???] they shuffled back towards the rear of the line . ' no [???] not at the
rear ! ' the slave - driver shouted . ' three files up . and stay there [???] or you ' ll
know it [???] when i come down the line ! ' he sent his long whip - lash cracking
over their heads ; then with another crack and a yell he started the company
off again at a brisk trot .
it was hard enough for poor sam [???] tired a s he was ; but for [???] it was
a torment [???] and soon a [???] . he set his teeth and tried to stop his mind
from thinking [???] and he struggled on . the stench of the sweating [???] about
him was [???] [???] and he began to gasp with thirst . on [???] on they went [???] and he
bent all his will to draw his breath and to make his legs keep going ; and
yet to what evil end he toiled and endured he did not dare to think . there
was no hope of falling out unseen : now and again the orc - driver fell back
and jeered at them .
' there now ! ' he laughed [???] [???] at their legs . ' where there ' s a whip
there ' s a will [???] my slugs . hold up ! i ' d give you a nice freshener now [???] only
you ' ll get as much lash as your skins will carry when you come in late to

your camp . do you good . don ' t you know we ' re at war ? '
they had gone some miles [???] and the road was at last running down a long
slope into the plain [???] when [???] ' s strength began to give out and his will
wavered . he lurched and [???] . desperately sam tried to help him and hold
him up [???] though he felt that he could himself hardly stay the pace much
longer . at any moment now he knew that the end would come : his master
would
faint or fall [???] and all would be discovered [???] and their bitter efforts be in
vain . ' i ' ll have that big slave - driving devil anyway [???] ' he thought .
then just as he was putting his hand to the hilt of his sword [???] there
came an unexpected relief . they were out on the plain now and drawing near
the entrance to [???] . some way in front of it [???] before the gate at the
bridge - end [???] the road from the west [???] with others coming from the
south [???] and from barad - dyr . along all the roads troops were moving ; for the
captains of the west were advancing and the dark lord was speeding his
forces north . so it chanced that several companies came together at the
road - meeting [???] in the dark beyond the light of the watch - fires on the wall .
at once there was great [???] and cursing as each troop tried to get
first to the gate and the ending of their march . though the drivers yelled
and plied their whips [???] [???] broke out and some blades were drawn . a
troop of heavy - armed [???] from barad - dyr charged into the [???] line and
threw them into confusion .
dazed as he was with pain and weariness [???] sam woke up [???] grasped quickly
at his chance [???] and threw himself to the ground [???] dragging [???] down with
him . [???] fell over them [???] [???] and cursing . slowly on hand and knee the
[???] [???] away out of the [???] [???] until at last [???] they
dropped over the further edge of the road . it had a high [???] by which
troop - leaders could guide themselves in black night or fog [???] and it was
banked up some feet above the level of the open land .
they lay still for a while . it was too dark to seek for cover [???] if
indeed there was any to find ; but sam felt that they ought at least to get
further away from the highways and out of the range of torch - light .
' come on [???] mr . [???] ! ' he whispered . ' one more [???] [???] and then you can
lie still . '
with a last despairing effort [???] raised himself on his hands [???] and
struggled on for maybe twenty yards . then he pitched down into a shallow pit
that opened [???] before them [???] and there he lay like a dead thing .




chapter 3 . mount doom



sam put his ragged orc - cloak under his master ' s head [???] and covered them
both with the grey robe of [???] ; and as he did so his thoughts went out to
that fair land [???] and to the elves [???] and he hoped that the cloth woven by their
hands might have some virtue to keep them hidden beyond all hope in this
wilderness of fear . he heard the [???] and cries die down as the troops
passed on through the [???] . it seemed that in the confusion and the
mingling of many companies of various kinds they had not been missed [???] not
yet at any rate .
sam took a sip of water [???] but pressed [???] to drink [???] and when his
master had recovered a little he gave him a whole wafer of their precious
[???] and made him ea t it . then [???] too worn out even to feel much fear [???]
they stretched themselves out . they slept a little in uneasy fits ; for their
sweat grew chill on them [???] and the hard stones bit them [???] and they shivered .
out of the north from the black gate through [???] [???] there flowed
whispering along the ground a thin cold air .
in the morning a grey light came again [???] for in the high regions the
west wind still blew [???] but down on the stones behind the fences of the black
land the air seemed almost dead [???] chill and yet [???] . sam looked up out
of the hollow . the land all about was dreary [???] flat and drab - hued . on the
roads nearby nothing was moving now ; but sam feared the watchful eyes on
the
wall of the [???] [???] no more than a furlong away northward .
south - eastward [???] far off like a dark standing shadow . loomed the mountain .
smokes were pouring from it and while those that rose into the upper air
trailed away eastward [???] great rolling clouds floated down its sides and
spread over the land . a few miles to the north - east the [???] of the
ashen mountains stood like [???] grey ghosts [???] behind which the misty
northern heights rose like a line of distant cloud hardly darker than the
lowering sky .
sam tried to guess the distances and to decide what way they ought to
take . it looks every step of fifty miles [???] ' he muttered [???] staring at
the threatening mountain [???] ' and that ' ll take a week [???] if it takes a day [???] with
mr . [???] as he is . ' he shook his head [???] and as he worked things out [???] slowly

a new dark thought grew in his mind . never for long had hope died in his
[???] heart [???] and always until now he had taken some thought for their
return . but the bitter truth came home to him at last : at best their
provision would take them to their goal ; and when the task was done [???] there
they would come to an end [???] alone [???] houseless [???] foodless in the midst of a
terrible desert . there could be no return .
' so that was the job i felt i had to do when i started [???] ' thought sam :
' to help mr . [???] to the last step and then die with him ? well [???] if that is
the job then i must do it . but i would dearly like to see bywater again [???] and
rosie cotton and her brothers [???] and the [???] and [???] and all . i can ' t
think somehow that [???] would have sent mr . [???] on this errand if there
hadn ' t a ' been any hope of his ever coming back at all . things all went
wrong when he went down in moria . i wish he hadn ' t . he would have done
something . '
but even as hope died in sam [???] or seemed to die [???] it was turned to a new
strength . sam ' s plain hobbit - face grew stern [???] almost grim [???] as the will
hardened in him [???] and he felt through all his limbs a thrill [???] as if he was
turning into some creature of stone and steel that neither despair nor
weariness nor endless barren miles could subdue .
with a new sense of responsibility he brought his eyes back to the
ground near at hand [???] studying the next move . as the light grew a little he
saw to his surprise that what from a distance had seemed wide and
featureless flats were in fact all broken and tumbled . indeed the whole
surface of the plains of [???] was pocked with great holes [???] as if [???] while
it was still a waste of soft mud [???] it had been smitten with a shower of bolts
and huge [???] . the largest of these holes were [???] with ridges of
broken rock [???] and broad [???] ran out from them in all directions . it was
a land in which it would be possible to creep from hiding to hiding [???] unseen
by all but the most watchful eyes : possible at least for one who was strong
and had no need for speed . for the hungry and worn [???] who had far to go before
life failed [???] it had an evil look .
thinking of all these things sam went back to his master . he had no
need to rouse him . [???] was lying on his back with eyes open [???] staring at
the cloudy sky . ' well [???] mr . [???] [???] ' said sam [???] ' i ' ve been having a look round
and thinking a bit . there ' s nothing on the roads [???] and we ' d best be getting
away while there ' s a chance . can you manage it ? '
' i can manage it [???] ' said [???] . ' i must . '

once more they started [???] [???] from hollow to hollow [???] flitting behind
such cover as they could find [???] but moving always in a slant towards the
[???] of the northern range . but as they went the most [???] of the
roads followed them [???] until it ran off [???] hugging the skirts of the mountains [???]
away into a wall of black shadow far ahead . neither man nor orc now moved
along its flat grey stretches ; for the dark lord had almost completed the
movement of his forces [???] and even in the fastness of his own realm he sought
the secrecy of night [???] fearing the winds of the world that had turned against
him [???] tearing aside his veils [???] and troubled with tidings of bold spies that
had passed through his fences .
the [???] had gone a few weary miles when they halted . [???] seemed
nearly spent . sam saw that he could not go much further in this fashion [???]
[???] [???] stooping [???] now picking a doubtful way very slowly [???] now hurrying at
a stumbling run .
' i ' m going back on to the road while the light lasts [???] mr . [???] [???] ' he
said . ' trust to luck again ! it nearly failed us last time [???] but it didn ' t
quite . a steady pace for a few more miles [???] and then a rest . '
he was taking a far greater risk than he knew ; but [???] was too much
occupied with his burden and with the struggle in his mind to debate [???] and
almost too hopeless to care . they climbed on to the causeway and [???]
along [???] down the hard cruel road that led to the dark tower itself . but their
luck held [???] and for the rest of that day they met no living or moving thing ;
and when night fell they vanished into the darkness of [???] . all the land
now brooded as at the coming of a great storm : for the captains of the west
had passed the cross - roads and set flames in the deadly fields of [???]
[???] .
so the desperate journey went on [???] as the ring went south and the
banners of the kings rode north . for the [???] each day [???] each mile . was
more bitter than the one before [???] as their strength lessened and the land
became more evil . they met no enemies by day . at times by night [???] as they
cowered or drowsed [???] in some hiding beside the road [???] they heard cries
and the noise of many feet or the swift passing of some cruelly ridden
steed . but far worse than all such perils was the ever - approaching threat
that beat upon them as they went : the dreadful menace of the power that
waited [???] brooding in deep thought and sleepless malice behind the dark veil
about its throne . nearer and nearer it drew [???] looming blacker [???] like the
[???] of a wall of night at the last end of the world .

there came at last a dreadful nightfall ; and even as the captains of
the west drew near to the end of the living lands [???] the two wanderers came to
an hour of blank despair . four days had passed since they had escaped from
the [???] [???] but the time lay behind them like an ever - darkening dream . all
this last day [???] had not spoken [???] but had walked half - bowed [???] often
stumbling [???] as if his eyes no longer saw the way before his feet . sam guessed
that among all their pains he bore the worst [???] the growing weight of the
ring [???] a burden on the body and a torment to his mind . anxiously sam had
noted how his master ' s left hand would often be raised as if to ward on a
blow [???] or to screen his shrinking eyes from a dreadful eye that sought to
look in them . and sometimes his right hand would creep to his breast [???]
clutching [???] and then slowly [???] as the will recovered mastery [???] it would be
withdrawn .
now as the blackness of night returned [???] sat [???] his head between his
knees [???] his arms hanging wearily to the ground where his hands lay feebly
[???] . sam watched him [???] till night covered them both and hid them from
one another . he could no longer find any words to say ; and he turned to his
own dark thoughts . as for himself [???] though weary and under a shadow of fear [???]
he still had some strength left . the [???] had a virtue without which they
would long ago have lain down to die . it did not satisfy desire [???] and at
times sam ' s mind was filled with the memories of food [???] and the longing for
simple bread and meats . and yet this [???] of the elves had a potency
that increased as travellers relied on it alone and did not mingle it with
other foods . it fed the will [???] and it gave strength to endure [???] and to master
sinew and limb beyond the measure of mortal kind . but now a new decision
must be made . they could not follow this road any longer ; for it went on
eastward into the great shadow [???] but the mountain now loomed upon their
right [???] almost due south [???] and they must turn towards it . yet still before it
there stretched a wide region of [???] [???] barren [???] ash - ridden land .
' water [???] water ! ' muttered sam . he had stinted himself [???] and in his
parched mouth his tongue seemed thick and [???] ; but for all his care they
now had very little left [???] perhaps half his bottle [???] and maybe there were
still days to go . all would long ago have been spent [???] if they had not dared
to follow the orc - road . for at long intervals on that highway [???] had
been built for the use of troops sent in haste through the waterless
regions . in one sam had found some water left [???] stale [???] [???] by the [???] [???]
but still sufficient for their desperate case . yet that was now a day ago .

there was no hope of any more .
at last wearied with his cares sam drowsed [???] leaving the morrow till it
came ; he could do no more . dream and waking mingled [???] . he saw
lights
like gloating yes [???] and dark creeping shapes [???] and he heard noises as of wild
beasts or the dreadful cries of tortured things ; and he would start up to
find the world all dark and only empty b lackness all about him . once only [???]
as he stood and stared wildly round [???] did it seem that [???] though now awake [???] he
could still see pale lights like eyes ; but soon they [???] and vanished .
the hateful night passed slowly and [???] . such da ylight as
followed was dim ; for here as the mountain drew near the air was ever mirky [???]
while out from the dark tower there crept the veils of shadow that [???]
wove about himself . [???] was lying on his back not moving . sam stood
beside
him [???] [???] to speak [???] and yet knowing that the word now lay with him : he
must set his master ' s will to work for another effort . at length [???] stooping
and caressing [???] ' s brow [???] he spoke in his ear .
' wake up [???] master ! ' he said . ' time for another start . '
as if roused by a sudden bell [???] [???] rose quickly [???] and stood up and
looked away southwards ; but when his eyes beheld the mountain and the desert
he [???] again .
' i can ' t manage it [???] sam [???] ' he said . ' it is such a weight to carry [???] such
a weight . '
sam knew before he spoke [???] that it was vain [???] and that such words might
do more harm than good [???] but in his pity he could not keep silent . ' then let
me carry it a bit for you [???] master [???] ' he said . ' you know i would [???] and gladly [???]
as long as i have any strength . '
a wild light came into [???] ' s eyes . ' stand away ! don ' t touch me ! ' he
cried . ' it is mine [???] i say . be off ! ' his hand strayed to his sword - hilt . but
then quickly his voice changed . ' no [???] no [???] sam [???] ' he said sadly . ' but you must
understand . it is my burden [???] and no one else can bear it . it is too late
now [???] sam dear . you can ' t help me in that way again . i am almost in its power
now . i could not give it up [???] and if you tried to take it i should go mad . '
sam nodded . ' i understand [???] ' he said . ' but i ' ve been thinking [???] mr .
[???] [???] there ' s other things we might do without . why not lighten the load a
bit ? we ' re going that way now [???] as straight as we can make it . ' he pointed to
the mountain . ' it ' s no good taking anything we ' re not sure to need . '

[???] looked again towards the mountain . ' no [???] ' he said [???] ' we shan ' t need
much on that road . and at its end nothing . ' picking up his orc - shield he
flung it away and threw his helmet after it . then pulling off the grey cloak
he undid the heavy belt and let it fall to the ground [???] and the sheathed
sword with it . the shreds of the black cloak he tore off and scattered .
' there [???] i ' ll be an orc no more [???] ' he cried [???] ' and i ' ll bear no weapon
fair or foul . let them take me [???] if they will ! '
sam did likewise [???] and put aside his orc - gear ; and he took out all the
things in his pack . somehow each of them had become dear to him [???] if only
because he had borne them so far with so much toil . hardest of all it was to
part with his cooking - gear . tears welled in his eyes at the thought of
casting it away .
' do you remember that bit of rabbit [???] mr . [???] ? ' he said . ' and our
place under the warm bank in captain [???] ' s country [???] the day i saw an
[???] ? '
' no [???] i am afraid not [???] sam [???] ' said [???] . ' at least [???] i know that such
things happened [???] but i cannot see them . no taste of food [???] no feel of water [???]
no sound of wind [???] no memory of tree or grass or flower [???] no image of moon or
star are left to me . i am naked in the dark . sam [???] and there is no veil
between me and the wheel of fire . i begin to see it even with my waking
eyes [???] and all else fades . '
sam went to him and kissed his hand . ' then the sooner we ' re rid of it [???]
the sooner to rest [???] ' he said haltingly [???] finding no better words to say .
' talking won ' t mend nothing [???] ' he muttered to himself [???] as he gathered up all
the things that they had chosen to cast away . he was not willing to leave
them lying open in the wilderness for any eyes to see . ' [???] picked up
that orc - shirt [???] seemingly [???] and he isn ' t going to add a sword to it . his
hands are bad enough when empty . and he isn ' t going to mess with my pans ! '
with that he carried all the gear away to one of the many gaping [???]
that scored the land and thr ew them in . the clatter of his precious pans as
they fell down into the dark was like a death - knell to his heart .
he came back to [???] [???] and then of his elven - rope he cut a short piece
to serve his master as a girdle and bind the grey cloak close about his
waist . the rest he carefully coiled and put back in his pack . beside that he
kept only the [???] of their [???] and the water - bottle [???] and sting
still hanging by his belt ; and hidden away in a pocket of his tunic next his
breast the ph ial of [???] and the little box that she gave him for his

own .
now at last they turned their faces to the mountain and set out [???]
thinking no more of concealment [???] bending their weariness and failing wills
only to the one task of going on . in the dimness of its dreary day few
things even in that land of [???] could have espied them [???] save from
close at hand . of all the slaves of the dark lord [???] only the [???] could
have warned him of the peril that crept [???] small but [???] [???] into the
very heart of his guarded realm . but the [???] and their black wings were
abroad on another errand : they were gathered far away [???] shadowing the march
of the captains of the west [???] and thither the thought of the dark tower was
turned .
that day it seemed to sam that his master had found some new strength [???]
more than could be explained by the small lightening of the load that he had
to carry . in the first marches they went further and faster than he had
hoped . the land was rough and hostile [???] and yet they made much progress [???] and
ever the mountain drew nearer . but as the day wore on and all too soon the
dim light began to fail [???] [???] stooped again [???] and began to stagger [???] as if
the renewed effort had [???] his remaining strength .
at their last halt he sank down and said : ' i ' m thirsty [???] sam [???] ' and did
not speak again . sam gave him a mouthful of water ; only one more mouthful
remained . he went without himself ; and now as once more the night of
[???]
closed over them [???] through all his thoughts there came the memory of water ;
and every brook or stream or fount that he had ever seen [???] under green
willow - shades or [???] in the sun [???] danced and rippled for his torment
behind the blindness of his eyes . he felt the cool mud about his toes as he
[???] in the pool at bywater with jolly cotton and tom and [???] [???] and their
sister rosie . ' but that was years ago [???] ' he sighed [???] ' and far away . the way
back [???] if there is one [???] goes past the mountain . '
he could not sleep and he held a debate with himself . ' well [???] come now [???]
we ' ve done better than you hoped [???] ' he said [???] . ' began well anyway . i
reckon we crossed half the distance before we stopped . one more day will do
it . ' and then he paused .
' don ' t be a fool [???] sam [???] [???] ' came an answer in his own voice . ' he
won ' t go another day like that [???] if he moves at all . and you can ' t go on much
longer giving him all the water and most of the food . '
' i can go on a good way though [???] and i will . '

' where to ? '
' to the mountain [???] of course . '
' but what then [???] sam [???] [???] what then ? when you get there [???] what are you
going to do ? he won ' t be able to do anything for himself . '
to his dismay sam realized that he had not got an answer to this . he
had no clear idea at all . [???] had not spoken much to him of his errand [???]
and sam only knew vaguely that the ring had somehow to be put into the fire .
' the cracks of doom [???] ' he muttered [???] the old name rising to his mind . ' well [???]
if master knows how to find them [???] i don ' t . '
' there you are ! ' came the answer . ' it ' s all quite useless . he said so
himself . you are the fool [???] going on hoping and toiling . you could have lain
down and gone to sleep together days ago [???] if you hadn ' t been so dogged . but
you ' ll die just the same [???] or worse . you might just as well lie down now and
give it up . you ' ll never get to the top anyway . '
' i ' ll get there [???] if i leave everything but my bones behind [???] ' said sam .
' and i ' ll carry mr . [???] up myself [???] if it breaks my back and heart . so stop
[???] ! '
at that moment sam felt a tremor in the ground beneath him [???] and he
heard or sensed a deep remote rumble as of thunder imprisoned under the
earth . there was a brief red flame that [???] under the clouds and died
away . the mountain too slept [???] .
the last stage of their journey to [???] came [???] and it was a torment
greater than sam had ever thought that he could bear . he was in pain [???] and so
parched that he could no longer swallow even a mouthful of food . it remained
dark [???] not only because of the smokes of the mountain : there seemed to be a
storm coming up [???] and away to the south - east there was a [???] of
lightnings under the black skies . worst of all [???] the air was full of fumes ;
breathing was painful and difficult [???] and a [???] came on them [???] so that
they [???] and often fell . and yet their wills did not yield [???] and they
struggled on .
the mountain crept up ever nearer [???] until [???] if they lifted their heavy
heads [???] it filled all their sight [???] looming vast before them : a huge mass of
ash and slag and burned stone [???] out of which a sheer - sided cone was raised
into the clouds . before the daylong [???] ended and true night came again
they had [???] and [???] to its very feet .
with a gasp [???] cast himself on the ground . sam sat by him . to his
surprise he felt tired but lighter [???] and his head seemed clear again . no more

debates disturbed his mind . he knew all the arguments of despair and would
not listen to them . his wi ll was set [???] and only death would break it . he felt
no longer either desire or need of sleep [???] but rather of watchfulness . he
knew that all the hazards and perils were now drawing together to a point :
the next day would be a day of doom [???] the day of final effort or disaster [???]
the last gasp .
but when would it come ? the night seemed endless and timeless [???] minute
after minute falling dead and adding up to no passing hour [???] bringing no
change . sam began to wonder if a second darkness had begun and no day
would
ever reappear . at last he groped for [???] ' s hand . it was cold and
trembling . his master was shivering .
' i didn ' t ought to have left my blanket behind [???] ' muttered sam ; and
lying down he tried to comfort [???] with his arms and body . then sleep took
him [???] and the dim light of the last day of their quest found them side by
side . the wind had fallen the day before as it shifted from the west [???] and
now it came from the north and began to rise ; and slowly the light of the
unseen sun filtered down into the shadows where the [???] lay .
' now for it ! now for the last gasp ! ' said sam as he struggled to his
feet . he bent over [???] [???] rousing him gently . [???] groaned ; but with a
great effort of will he [???] up ; and then he fell upon his knees again .
he raised his eyes with difficulty to the dark [???] of mount doom towering
above him [???] and then pitifully he began to [???] forward on his hands .
sam looked at him and wept in his heart [???] but no tears came to his dry
and stinging eyes . ' i said i ' d carry him [???] if it broke my back [???] ' he muttered [???]
' and i will ! '
' come [???] mr . [???] ! ' he cried . ' i can ' t carry it for you [???] but i can carry
you and it as well . so up you get ! come on [???] mr . [???] dear ! sam will give
you a ride . just tell him where to go [???] and he ' ll go . '
as [???] clung upon his back [???] arms loosely about his neck [???] legs clasped
firmly under his arms [???] sam [???] to his feet ; and then to his amazement
he felt the burden light . he had feared that he would have barely strength
to lift his master alone [???] and beyond that he had expected to share in the
dreadful dragging weight of the accursed ring . but it was not so . whether
because [???] was so worn by his long pains [???] wound of knife [???] and venomous
sting [???] and sorrow [???] fear [???] and homeless wandering [???] or because some gift of
final strength was given to him [???] sam lifted [???] with no more difficulty

than if he were carrying a hobbit - child pig - a - back in some romp on the lawns
or [???] of the shire . he took a deep breath and started off .
they had reached the mountain ' s foot on its northern side [???] and a little
to the westward ; there its long grey [???] [???] though broken [???] were not sheer .
[???] did not speak [???] and so sam struggled on as best he could [???] having no
[???] but the will to climb as high as might be before his strength gave
out and his will broke . on he toiled [???] up and up [???] turning this way and that
to lessen the slope [???] often stumbling forward [???] and at the last [???] like
a snail with a heavy burden on its back . when his will could drive him no
further [???] and his limbs gave way [???] he stopped and laid his master gently down .
[???] opened his eyes and drew a breath . it was easier to breathe up
here above the reeks that coiled and drifted down below . ' thank you [???] sam [???] '
he said in a cracked whisper . ' how far is there to go ? '
' i don ' t know [???] ' said sam [???] ' because i don ' t know where we ' re going . '
he looked back [???] and then he looked up ; and he was amazed to see how far
his last effort had brought him . the mountain standing [???] and alone had
looked taller than it was . sam saw now that it was less lofty than the high
passes of the [???] d [???] ath which he and [???] had scaled . the confused and
tumbled shoulders of its great base rose for maybe three thousand feet above
the plain [???] and above them was reared half as high again its tall central
cone [???] like a vast oast or chimney capped with a jagged crater . but already
sam was more than half way up the base [???] and the pla in of [???] was dim
below him [???] wrapped in fume and shadow . as he looked up he would have
given a
shout . if his parched throat had allowed him ; for amid the rugged humps and
shoulders above him he saw plainly a path or road . it climbed like a rising
girdle from the west and wound [???] about the mountain [???] until before it
went round out of view it reached the foot of the cone upon its eastern
side .
sam could not see the course immediately above him [???] where it was
lowest [???] for a steep slope went up from where he stood ; but he guessed that
if he could only struggle on just a little way further up [???] they would strike
this path . a gleam of hope returned to him . they might conquer the mountain
yet . ' why [???] it might have been put there a - purpose ! ' he said to himself . ' if
it wasn ' t there [???] i ' d have to say i was beaten in the end . '
the path was not put there for the purposes of sam . he did not know it [???]
but he was looking at [???] ' s road from barad - dyr to the [???] [???] [???] the

chambers of fire . out from the dark tower ' s huge western gate it came over a
deep [???] by a vast bridge of iron [???] and then passing into the plain it ran
for a league between two smoking [???] [???] and so reached a long [???]
causeway that led up on to the mountain ' s eastern side . thence [???] turning and
[???] all its wide girth from south to north [???] it climbed at last [???] high
in the upper cone [???] but still far from the reeking summit [???] to a dark entrance
that gazed back east straight to the window of the eye in [???] ' s
shadow - mantled fortress . often blocked or destroyed by the tumults of the
mountain ' s furnaces [???] always that road was repaired and cleaned again by the
labours of countless [???] .
sam drew a deep breath . there was a path [???] but how he was to get up the
slope to it he did not know . first he must ease his aching back . he lay flat
beside [???] for a while . neither spoke . slowly the light grew . suddenly a
sense of urgency which he did not understand came to sam . it was almost as
if he had been called : ' now [???] now [???] or it will be too late ! ' he braced himself
and got up . [???] also seemed to have felt the call . he struggled to his
knees .
' i ' ll [???] [???] sam [???] ' he gasped .
so foot by foot [???] like small grey [???] [???] they crept up the sl ope . they
came to the path and found that it was broad [???] paved with broken rubble and
beaten ash . [???] [???] on to it [???] and then moved as if by some
compulsion he turned slowly to face the east . far off the shadows of [???]
hung ; but torn by some gust of wind out of the world [???] or else moved by some
great [???] within [???] the mantling clouds [???] [???] and for a moment drew
aside ; and then he saw [???] rising black [???] blacker and darker than the vast
shades amid which it stood [???] the cruel [???] and iron crown of the
topmost tower of barad - dyr . one moment only it stared out [???] but as from some
great window [???] high there stabbed northward a flame of red [???] the
[???] of a piercing eye ; and then the shadows were furled again and the
terrible vision was removed . the eye was not turned to them : it was gazing
north to where the captains of the west stood at bay [???] and thither all its
malice was now bent [???] as the power moved to strike its deadly blow ; but [???]
at that dreadful glimpse fell as one [???] mortally . his hand sought the
chain about his neck .
sam knelt by him . faint [???] almost [???] [???] he heard [???] whispering :
' help me [???] sam ! help me [???] sam ! hold my hand ! i can ' t stop it . ' sam took his
master ' s hands a nd laid them together [???] palm to palm [???] and kissed them ; and

then he held them gently between his own . the thought came suddenly to him :
' he ' s spotted us ! it ' s all up [???] or it soon will be . now [???] sam [???] [???] this is
the end of ends . '
again he lifted [???] and drew his hands down to his own breast .
letting his master ' s legs dangle . then he bowed his head and struggled off
along the climbing road . it was not as easy a way to take as it had looked
at first . by fortune the fires that had poured forth in the great [???]
when sam stood upon [???] ungol had flowed down mainly on the southern
and
western [???] [???] and the road on this side was not blocked . yet in many
places it had [???] away or was crossed by gaping rents . after climbing
eastward for some time it bent back upon itself at a sharp angle and went
westward fox a space . there at the bend it was cut deep through a crag of
old weathered stone once long ago [???] from the mountain ' s furnaces .
panting under his load sam turned the bend ; and even as he did so [???] out of
the corner of his eye [???] he had a glimpse of something falling from the crag [???]
like a small piece of black stone that had toppled off as he passed .
a sudden weight smote him and he [???] forward [???] tearing the backs of
his hands that still clasped his master ' s . then he knew what had happened [???]
for above him as he lay he heard a hated voice .
' wicked masster ! ' it [???] . ' wicked masster cheats us ; cheats [???] [???]
[???] . he [???] ' t go that wa y . he [???] ' t hurt preciouss . give it to
[???] [???] yess [???] give it to us ! give it to uss ! '
with a violent heave sam rose up . at once he drew his sword ; but he
could do nothing . [???] and [???] were locked together . [???] was tearing
at his master [???] trying to get at the chain and the ring . this was probably
the only thing that could have roused the dying embers of [???] ' s heart and
will : an attack [???] an attempt to wrest his treasure from him by force . he
fought back with a sudden fury that amazed sam [???] and [???] also . even so
things might have gone far otherwise [???] if [???] himself had remained
unchanged ; but whatever dreadful paths [???] lonely and hungry and waterless [???] he
had trodden [???] driven by a devouring desire and a terrible fear [???] they had left
grievous marks on him . he was a lean [???] starved [???] [???] thing [???] all bones and
tight - drawn sallow skin . a wild light flamed in his eyes [???] but his malice was
no longer matched by his old griping strength . [???] flung him off and rose
up [???] .
' down [???] down ! ' he gasped [???] clutching his hand to his breast [???] so that

beneath the cover of his leather shirt he clasped the ring . ' down you
creeping thing [???] and out of my path ! your time is at an end . you cannot
betray me or slay me now . '
then suddenly [???] as before under the eaves of the emyn muil [???] sam saw
these two rivals with other vision . a [???] shape [???] scarcely more than
the shadow of a living thing [???] a creature now wholly ruined and defeated [???] yet
filled with a hideous lust and rage ; and before it stood stern [???] [???]
now by pity [???] a figure robed in white [???] but at its breast it held a wheel of
fire . out of the fire there spoke a commanding voice .
' begone [???] and trouble me no more ! if you touch me ever again [???] you shall
be cast yourself into the fire of doom . '
the [???] shape backed away [???] terror in its blinking eyes [???] and yet
at the same time [???] desire .
then the vision passed and sam saw [???] standing [???] hand on breast [???] his
breath coming in great [???] [???] and [???] at his feet [???] resting on his knees
with his wide - [???] hands upon the ground .
' look out ! ' cried sam . ' he ' ll spring ! ' he stepped forward [???] brandishing
his sword . ' quick [???] master ! ' he gasped . ' go on ! go on ! no time to lose . i ' ll
deal with him . go on ! '
[???] looked at him as if at one now far away . ' yes [???] i must go on [???] ' he
said . ' farewell [???] sam ! this is the end at last . on mount doom doom shall
fall . farewell ! ' he turned and went on [???] walking slowly but erect u p the
climbing path .
' now ! ' said sam . ' at last i can deal with you ! ' he leaped forward with
drawn blade ready for battle . but [???] did not spring . he fell flat upon
the ground and [???] .
' don ' t kill us [???] ' he wept . ' don ' t hurt us with na [???] cruel steel ! let
us live [???] yes [???] live just a little longer . lost lost ! we ' re lost . and when
precious goes we ' ll die [???] yes [???] die into the dust . ' he [???] up the ashes of
the path with his long fleshless fingers . ' [???] ! ' he [???] .
sam ' s hand wa vered . his mind was hot with wrath and the memory of evil .
it would be just to slay this treacherous [???] murderous creature [???] just and many
times deserved ; and also it seemed the only safe thing to do . but deep in
his heart there was something that restrained him : he could not strike this
thing lying in the dust [???] forlorn [???] ruinous [???] utterly wretched . he himself [???]
though only for a little while [???] had borne the ring [???] and now dimly he guessed
the agony of [???] ' s [???] mind and body [???] [???] to tha t ring [???]

unable to find peace or relief ever in life again . but sam had no words to
express what he felt .
' oh [???] curse you [???] you stinking thing ! ' he said . ' go away ! be off ! i don ' t
trust you [???] not as far as i could kick you ; but be off . or i shall hurt you [???]
yes [???] with [???] cruel steel . '
[???] got up on all fours [???] and backed away for several paces [???] and then
he turned [???] and as sam aimed a kick at him he fled away down the path . sam
gave no more heed to him . he suddenly remembered his master . he looked
up
the path and could not see him . as fast as he could he [???] up the road .
if he had looked back [???] he might have seen not far below [???] turn again [???]
and then with a wild light of madness glaring in his eyes come [???] swiftly but
warily [???] creeping on behind [???] a slinking shadow among the stones .
the path climbed on . soon it bent again and . with a last eastward
course passed in a cutting along the face of the cone and came to the dark
door in the mountain ' s side [???] the door of the [???] th [???] . far away now
rising towards the south the sun [???] piercing the smokes and haze [???] burned
[???] [???] a dull bleared disc of red ; but all [???] lay about the mountain
like a dead land [???] silent [???] shadow - folded [???] waiting for some dreadful stroke .
sam came to the gaping mouth and peered in . it was dark and hot [???] and a
deep rumbling shook the air . ' [???] ! master ! ' he called . there was no
answer . for a moment he stood [???] his heart beating with wild fears [???] and then
he [???] in . a shadow followed him .
at first he could see nothing . in his great need he drew out once more
the phial of [???] [???] but it was pale and cold in his trembling hand and
threw no light into that [???] dark . he was come to the heart of the
realm of [???] and the forges of his ancient might [???] greatest in
middle - earth ; all other powers were here subdued . fearfully he took a few
uncertain steps in the dark [???] and then all at once there came a flash of red
that leaped upward [???] and smote the high black roof . then sam saw that he was
in a long cave or tunnel that bored into the mountain ' s smoking cone . but
only a short way ahead its floor and the walls on either side were cloven by
a great [???] [???] out of which the red glare came [???] now leaping u p [???] now dying
down into darkness ; and all the while far below there was a rumour and a
trouble as of great engines [???] and labouring .
the light sprang up again [???] and there on the brink of the chasm [???] at the
very crack of doom [???] stood [???] [???] black against the glare [???] tense [???] erect [???] but

still as if he had been turned to stone .
' master ! ' cried sam .
then [???] stirred and spoke with a clear voice [???] indeed with a voice
clearer and more powerful than sam had ever heard him use [???] and it rose above
the throb and [???] of mount doom [???] ringing in the roof and walls .
' i have come [???] ' he said . ' but i do not choose now to do what i came to
do . i will not do this deed . the ring is mine ! ' and suddenly [???] as he set it
on his finger [???] he vanished from sam ' s sight . sam gasped [???] but he had no
chance to cry out [???] for at that moment many things happened .
something struck sam violently in the back [???] his legs were knocked from
under him and he was flung aside [???] striking his head against the stony floor [???]
as a dark shape sprang over him . he lay still and for a moment all went
black .
and far away [???] as [???] put on the ring and claimed it for his own [???] even
in [???] [???] the very heart of his realm [???] the power in barad - dyr was
shaken [???] and the tower trembled from its foundations to its proud and bitter
crown . the dark lord was suddenly aware of him [???] and his eye piercing all
shadows looked across the plain to the door that he had made ; and the
magnitude of his own folly was revealed to him in a blinding flash [???] and all
the devices of his enemies were at last laid bare . then his wrath blazed in
consuming flame [???] but his fear rose like a vast black smoke to choke him . for
he knew his deadly peril and the thread upon which his doom now hung .
from all his [???] and webs of fear and treachery [???] from all his
stratagems and wars his mind shook free ; and throughout his realm a tremor
ran [???] his slaves [???] [???] and his armies halted [???] and his captains suddenly
[???] [???] bereft of will [???] wavered and despaired . for they were forgotten .
the whole mind and purpose of the power that [???] them was now bent
with
overwhelming force upon the mountain . at his summons [???] wheeling with a
rending cry [???] in a last desperate race there flew [???] faster than the winds [???] the
[???] the [???] [???] and with a storm of wings they hurtled southwards to
mount doom .
sam got up . he was dazed [???] and blood streaming from his head dripped in
his eyes . he groped forward [???] and then he saw a strange and terrible thing .
[???] on the edge of the [???] was fighting like a mad thing with an unseen
foe . to and fro he swayed [???] now so near the brink that almost he tumbled in [???]
now dragging back [???] falling to the ground [???] rising [???] and falling again . and all

the while he [???] but spoke no words .
the fires below awoke in anger [???] the red light blazed [???] and all the
cavern was filled with a great glare and heat . suddenly sam saw [???] ' s
long hands draw upwards to his mouth ; his white fangs gleamed [???] and then
snapped as they bit . [???] gave a cry [???] and there he was [???] fallen upon his
knees at the chasm ' s edge . but [???] [???] dancing like a mad thing [???] held aloft
the ring [???] a finger still thrust within its circle . it shone now as if verily
it was wrought of living fire .
' precious [???] precious [???] precious ! ' [???] cried . ' my precious ! o my
precious ! ' and with that [???] even as his eyes were lifted up to gloat on his
prize [???] he stepped too far [???] toppled [???] wavered for a moment on the brink [???] and
then with a shriek he fell . out of the depths came his last wail precious [???]
and he was gone .
there was a roar and a great confusion of noise . fires leaped up and
licked the roof . the [???] grew to a great tumult [???] and the mountain
shook . sam ran to [???] and picked him up and carried him . out to the door .
and there upon the dark [???] of the [???] [???] [???] high above the plains
of [???] [???] such wonder and terror came on him that he stood still forgetting
all else [???] and gazed as one turned to st one .
a brief vision he had of [???] cloud [???] and in the midst of it towers
and battlements [???] tall as hills [???] founded upon a mighty mountain - throne above
[???] pits ; great courts and dungeons [???] eyeless prisons sheer as
cliffs [???] and gaping gates of steel and adamant : and then all passed . towers
fell and mountains slid ; walls [???] and melted [???] [???] down ; vast
spires of smoke and [???] steams went [???] up [???] up [???] until they
toppled like an overwhelming wave [???] and its wild crest curled and came
foaming down upon the land . and then at last over the miles between there
came a rumble [???] rising to a deafening crash and roar ; the earth shook [???] the
plain heaved and cracked [???] and [???] [???] . fire belched from its riven
summit . the skies burst into thunder seared with lightning . down like
[???] whips fell a torrent of black rain . and into the heart of the storm [???]
with a cry that pierced all other sounds [???] tearing the clouds asunder [???] the
[???] came [???] shooting like flaming bolts [???] as caught in the fiery ruin of
hill and sky they crackled [???] withered [???] and went out .
' well [???] this is the end [???] sam [???] [???] ' said a voice by his side . and
there was [???] [???] pale and worn [???] and yet himself again ; and in his eyes there
was peace now [???] neither strain of will [???] nor madness [???] nor any fear . his burden

was taken away . there was the dear master of the sweet days in the shire .
' master ! ' cried sam . and fell upon his knees . in all that ruin of the
world for the momen t he felt only joy [???] great joy . the burden was gone . his
master had been saved ; he was himself again [???] he was free . and then sam
caught sight of the [???] and bleeding hand .
' your poor hand ! ' he said . ' and i have nothing to bind it with [???] or
comfort it . i would have spared him a whole hand of mine rather . but he ' s
gone now beyond recall [???] gone for ever . '
' yes [???] ' said [???] . ' but do you remember [???] ' s words : even [???]
may have something yet to do ? but for him [???] sam [???] i could not have destroyed
the ring . the quest would have been in vain [???] even at the bitter end . so let
us forgive him ! for the quest is achieved [???] and now all is over . i am glad
you are here with me . here at the end of all things [???] sam . '




chapter 4 . the field of [???]



all about the hills the hosts of [???] raged . the captains of the west
were foundering in a gathering sea . the sun gleamed red [???] and under the wings
of the [???] the shadows of death fell dark upon the earth . [???] stood
beneath his banner [???] silent and stern [???] as one lost in thought of things long
past or far away ; but his eyes gleamed like stars that shine the brighter as
the night deepens . upon the hill - top stood [???] [???] and he was white and
cold and no shadow fell on him . the [???] of [???] broke like a wave on
the [???] hills [???] voices roaring like a tide amid the wreck and crash
of arms .
as if to his eyes some sudden vision had been given [???] [???] stirred ;
and he turned [???] looking back north where the skies were pale and clear . then
he lifted up his hands and cried in a loud voice ringing above the din : the
eagles are coming ! and many voices answered crying : the eagles are
coming !
the eagles are coming ! the hosts of [???] looked up and wondered what
this
sign might mean .
there came [???] the windlord [???] and [???] his brother [???] greatest of
all the eagles of the north [???] mightiest of the descendants of old [???] [???]
who built his eyries in the [???] peaks of the [???] mountains
when middle - earth was young . behind them in long swift lines came all their
vassals from the northern mountains [???] speeding on a gathering wind . straight
down upon the [???] they bore [???] stooping suddenly out of the high airs [???] and
the rush of their wide wings as they passed over was like a gale .
but the [???] turned and fled [???] and vanished into [???] ' s shadows [???]
hearing a sudden terrible call out of the dark tower ; and even at that
moment all the hosts of [???] trembled [???] doubt clutched their hearts [???] their
laughter failed [???] their hands shook and their limbs were loosed . the power
that drove them on and filled them with hate and fury was wavering [???] its will
was removed from them ; and now looking in the eyes of their enemies they
saw
a deadly light and were afraid .

then all the captains of the west cried aloud [???] for their hearts were
filled with a new hope in the midst of darkness . out from the [???]
hills knights of [???] [???] riders of [???] [???] d [???] nedain of the north [???]
close - serried companies [???] drove against their wavering foes [???] piercing the
press with the thrust of bitter spears . but [???] lifted up his arms and
called once more in a clear voice :
' stand [???] men of the west ! stand and wait ! this is the hour of doom . '
and even as he spoke the earth rocked beneath their feet . then rising
swiftly up [???] far above the towers of the black gate [???] high above the
mountains [???] a vast soaring darkness sprang into the sky [???] [???] with
fire . the earth groaned and quaked . the towers of the teeth swayed [???]
tottered [???] and fell down ; the mighty rampart [???] ; the black gate was
hurled in ruin ; and from far away [???] now dim [???] now growing [???] now mounting to
the
clouds [???] there came a drumming rumble [???] a roar [???] a long echoing roll of ruinous
noise .
' the realm of [???] is ended ! ' said [???] . ' the ring - bearer has
fulfilled his quest . ' and as the captains gazed south to the land of [???] [???]
it seemed to them that [???] black against the pall of cloud [???] there rose a huge
shape of shadow [???] [???] [???] lightning - crowned [???] filling all the sky .
enormous it reared above the world [???] and stretched out towards them a vast
threatening hand [???] terrible but impotent : for even as it leaned over them [???] a
great wind took it [???] and it was all blown away [???] and passed ; and then a hush
fell .
the captains bowed their heads ; and when they looked up again [???] behold !
their enemies were flying and the power of [???] was scattering like dust
in the wind . as when death smites the [???] brooding thing that inhabits
their [???] hill and holds them all in sway [???] ants will wander witless and
purposeless and then feebly die [???] so the creatures of [???] [???] orc or troll or
beast spell - [???] [???] ran hither and thither mindless ; and some slew
themselves [???] or cast themselves in pits [???] or fled wailing back to hide in
holes and dark lightless places far from hope . but the men of rhyn and of
harad [???] [???] and southron [???] saw the ruin of their war and the great
majesty and glory of the captains of the west . and those that were deepest
and longest in evil servitude [???] hating the west [???] and yet were men proud and
bold [???] in their turn now gathered themselves for a last stand of desperate
battle . but the most part fled eastward as they could ; and some cast their

weapons down and sued for mercy .
then [???] [???] leaving all such matters of battle and command to [???]
and the other lords [???] stood upon the hill - top and called ; and down to him
came the great eagle [???] [???] the windlord [???] and stood before him .
' twice you have borne me [???] [???] my friend [???] ' said [???] . ' thrice
shall pay for all [???] if you are willing . you will not find me a burden much
greater than when you bore me from [???] - [???] [???] where my old life burned
away . '
' i would bear you [???] ' answered [???] [???] ' whither you will [???] even were you
made of stone . '
' then come [???] and let your brother go with us [???] and some other of your
folk who is most swift ! for we have need of speed greater than any wind [???]
[???] the wings of the [???] . '
' the north wind blows [???] but we shall [???] it [???] ' said [???] . and he
lifted up [???] and sped away south [???] and with him went [???] [???] and
[???] young and swift . and they passed over [???] and [???] and
saw
all the land in ruin and tumult beneath them [???] and before them mount doom
blazing [???] pouring out its fire .
' i am glad that you are here with me [???] ' said [???] . ' here at the end of
all things [???] sam . '
' yes [???] i am with you [???] master [???] ' said sam [???] laying [???] ' s wounded hand
gently to his breast . ' and you ' re with me . and the journey ' s finished . but
after coming all that way i don ' t want to give up yet . it ' s not like me [???]
somehow [???] if you understand . '
' maybe not [???] sam [???] ' said [???] ; ' but it ' s like things are in the world .
hopes fail . an end comes . we have only a little time to wait now . we are
lost in ruin and downfall [???] and there is no escape . '
' well [???] master [???] we could at least go further from this dangerous place
here [???] from this crack of doom [???] if that ' s its name . now couldn ' t we ? come [???]
mr . [???] [???] let ' s go down the path at any rate ! '
' very well [???] sam . if you wish to go [???] i ' ll come [???] ' said [???] ; and they
rose and went slowly down the winding road ; and even as they passed towards
the mountain ' s quaking feet [???] a great smoke and steam belched from the
[???] [???] [???] and the side of the cone was riven open [???] and a huge fiery
vomit rolled in slow thunderous cascade down the eastern mountain - side .
[???] and sam could go no further . their last strength of mind and body

was swiftly ebbing . they had reached a low ashen hill piled at the
mountain ' s foot ; but from it there was no more escape . it was an island now [???]
not long to endure [???] amid the torment of [???] . all about it the earth
gaped [???] and from deep [???] and pits smoke and fumes leaped up . behind them
the mountain was [???] . great rents opened in its side . slow rivers of
fire came down the long [???] towards them . soon they would be [???] . a
rain of hot ash was falling .
they stood now ; and sam still holding his master ' s hand caressed it . he
sighed . ' what a tale we have been in [???] mr . [???] [???] haven ' t we ? ' he said . ' i
wish i could hear it told ! do you think they ' ll say : now comes the story of
nine - fingered [???] and the ring of doom ? and then everyone will hush [???] like
we did [???] when in [???] they told us the tale of beren one - hand and the
great jewel . i wish i could hear it ! and i wonder how it will go on after
our part . '
but even while he spoke so [???] to keep fear away until the very last [???] his
eyes still strayed north [???] north into the eye of the wind [???] to where the sky
far off was clear [???] as the cold blast [???] rising to a gale [???] drove back the
darkness and the ruin of the clouds .

and so it was that [???] saw them with his keen far - seeing eyes [???] as
down the wild wind he came [???] and daring the great peril of the skies he
circled in the air : two small dark figures [???] forlorn [???] hand in hand upon a
little hill [???] while the world shook under them [???] and gasped [???] and rivers of
fire drew near . and even as he espied them and came [???] down [???] he
saw
them fall [???] worn out [???] or choked with fumes and heat [???] or [???] down by
despair at last [???] hiding the ir eyes from death .
side by side they lay ; and down swept [???] [???] and down came [???]
and [???] the swift ; and in a dream [???] not knowing what fate had befallen
them [???] the wanderers were lifted up and borne far away out of the darkness
and the fire .
when sam awoke [???] he found that he was lying on some soft bed [???] but over
him gently swayed wide [???] boughs [???] and through their young leaves
sunlight [???] [???] green and gold . all the air was full of a sweet mingled
scent .
he remembered that smell : the fragrance of [???] . ' bless me ! ' he
mused . ' how long have i been asleep ? ' for the scent had borne him back to

the day when he had lit his little fire under the sunny bank ; and for a
moment all else between was out of waking memory . he stretched and drew
a
deep breath . ' why [???] what a dream i ' ve had ! ' he muttered . ' i am glad to wake ! '
he sat up and then he saw that [???] was lying beside him [???] and slept
peacefully [???] one hand behind his head [???] and the other resting upon the
coverlet . it was the right hand [???] and the third finger was missing .
full memory flooded back [???] and sam cried aloud : ' it wasn ' t a dream ! then
where are we ? '
and a voice spoke softly behind : ' in the land of [???] [???] and in the
keeping of the king ; and he [???] you . ' with that [???] stood before him [???]
robed in white [???] his beard now gleaming like pure snow in the [???] of
the leafy sunlight . ' well [???] master [???] [???] how do you feel ? ' he said .
but sam lay back [???] and stared with open mouth [???] and for a moment [???] between
[???] and great joy [???] he could not answer . at last he gasped :
' [???] ! i thought you were dead ! but then i thought i was dead myself . is
everything sad going to come untrue ? what ' s happened to the world ? '
' a great shadow has departed [???] ' said [???] [???] and then he laughed and
the sound was like music [???] or like water in a parched land ; and as he
listened the thought came to sam that he had not heard laughter [???] the pure
sound of merriment [???] for days upon days without count . it fell upon his ears
like the echo of all the joys he had ever known . but he himself burst into
tears . then [???] as a sweet rain will pass down a wind of spring and the sun
will shine out the clearer [???] his tears ceased [???] and his laughter welled up [???]
and laughing he sprang from his bed .
' how do i feel ? ' he cried . ' well [???] i don ' t know how to say it . i feel [???] i
feel ' - he waved his arms in the air - ' i feel like spring after winter [???] and
sun on the leaves ; and like trumpets and harps and all the songs i have ever
heard ! ' he stopped and he turned towards his master . ' but how ' s mr . [???] ? '
he said . ' isn ' t it a shame about his poor hand ? but i hope he ' s all right
otherwise . he ' s had a cruel time . '
' yes [???] i am all right otherwise [???] ' said [???] [???] sitting up and laughing in
his turn . i fell asleep again waiting for you [???] sam [???] you sleepyhead . i was
awake early this morning [???] and now it must be nearly noon . '
' noon ? ' said sam [???] trying to calculate . ' noon of what day ? '
' the fourteenth of the new year [???] ' said [???] ; ' or if you like [???] the
eighth day of april in the shire reckoning . ( but in [???] the new year will

always now begin upon the twenty - fifth of march when [???] fell [???] and when
you were brought out of the fire to the king . he has tended you [???] and now he
[???] you . you shall eat and drink with him . when you are ready i will lead
you to him . '
' the king ? ' said sam . ' what king [???] and who is he ? '
' the king of [???] and lord of the western lands [???] ' said [???] ' and
he has taken back all his ancient realm . he will ride soon to his crowning [???]
but he waits for you . '
' what shall we wear ? ' said sam ; for all he could see was the old and
[???] clothes that they had journeyed in [???] lying folded on the ground
beside their beds .
' the clothes that you wore on your way to [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' even
the orc - rags that you bore in the black land ; [???] [???] shall be preserved . no
silks and linens [???] nor any armour or heraldry could be more honourable . but
later i will find some other clothes [???] perhaps . '
then he held out his hands to them [???] and they saw that one shone with
light . ' what have you got there ? ' [???] cried . ' can it be - ? '
' yes [???] i have brought your two treasures . they were found on sam when
you were rescued . the lady [???] ' s gifts : your glass [???] [???] [???] and your
box [???] sam . you will be glad to have these safe again . '
when they were washed and clad [???] and had eaten a light meal [???] the [???]
followed [???] . they stepped out of the beech - grove in which they had
lain [???] and passed on to a long green lawn [???] glowing in sunshine [???] bordered by
stately dark - leaved trees laden with scarlet blossom . behind them they could
hear the sound of falling water [???] and a stream ran down before them between
flowering banks [???] until it came to a [???] at the lawn ' s foot and passed
then on under an archway of trees [???] through which they saw the [???] of
water far away .
as they came to the opening in the wood [???] they were surprised to see
knights in bright mail and tall guards in silver and black standing there [???]
who greeted them with honour and bowed before them . and then one blew a
long
trumpet [???] and they went on through the aisle of trees beside the singing
stream . so they came to a wide green land [???] and beyond it was a broad river
in a silver haze [???] out of which rose a long wooded isle [???] and many ships lay
by its shores . but on the field where they now stood a great host was drawn
up [???] in ranks and companies glittering in the sun . and as the [???]

approached swords were [???] [???] and spears were shaken [???] and horns and
trumpets sang [???] and men cried with many voices and in many tongues :
' long live the halflings ! praise them with great praise !
cuio i [???] anann ! aglar ' ni [???] !
praise them with great praise [???] [???] and [???] !
daur a [???] [???] conin en annyn ! [???] !
praise them !
[???] !
a laita te [???] laita te ! andave [???] !
praise them !
[???] [???] a laita [???] !
praise them ! the ring - bearers [???] praise them with great praise ! '
and so the red blood blushing in their faces and their eyes shining
with wonder [???] [???] and sam went forward and saw that [???] the
clamorous
host were set three high - seats built of green turves . behind the seat upon
the right floated [???] white on green [???] a great horse running free ; upon the left
was a banner [???] silver upon blue [???] a ship swan - prowed faring on the sea ; but
behind the highest throne in the midst of all a great standard was spread in
the breeze [???] and there a white tree flowered upon a sable field beneath a
shining crown and seven glittering stars . on the throne sat a mail - clad man [???]
a great sword was laid across his knees [???] but he wore no helm . as they drew
near he rose . and then they knew him [???] changed as he was [???] so high and glad of
face [???] kingly [???] lord of men [???] dark - haired with eyes of grey .
[???] ran to meet him [???] and sam followed close behind . ' well [???] if that
isn ' t the crown of all ! ' he said . ' strider [???] or i ' m still asleep ! '
' yes [???] sam [???] strider [???] ' said [???] . ' it is a long way [???] is it not [???] from
bree [???] where you did not like the look of me ? a long way for us all but yours
has been the darkest road . '
and then to sam ' s surprise and utter confusion he bowed his knee before
them ; and taking them by the hand [???] [???] upon his right and sam upon his
left [???] he led them to the throne [???] and setting them upon it [???] he turned to the
men and captains who stood by and spoke [???] so that his voice rang over all the
host [???] crying :
' praise them with great praise ! '
and when the glad shout had swelled up and died away again [???] to sam ' s
final and complete satisfaction and pure joy [???] a [???] of [???] stood

forth [???] and knelt [???] and begged leave to sing . and behold ! he said :
' lo ! lords and knights and men of valour [???] [???] kings and princes [???]
and fair people of [???] [???] and riders of [???] [???] and ye sons of [???] [???] and
d [???] nedain of the north [???] and elf and dwarf [???] and [???] of the shire [???] and
all free folk of the west [???] now listen to my lay . for i will sing to you of
[???] of the nine fingers and the ring of doom . '
and when sam heard that he laughed aloud for sheer delight [???] and he
stood up and cried : ' o great glory and [???] ! and all my wishes have
come true ! ' and then he wept .
and all the host laughed and wept [???] and in the midst of their merriment
and tears the clear voice of the [???] rose like silver and gold [???] and all
men were hushed . and he sang to them [???] now in the elven - tongue [???] now in the
speech of the west [???] until their hearts [???] wounded with sweet words [???]
[???] [???] and their joy was like swords [???] and they passed in thought out to
regions where pain and delight flow together and tears are the ver y wine of
blessedness .
and at the last [???] as the sun fell from the noon and the shadows of the
trees lengthened [???] he ended . ' praise them with great praise ! ' he said and
knelt . and then [???] stood up [???] and all the host arose [???] and they passed to
[???] made ready [???] to eat and drink and make merry while the day lasted .
[???] and sam were led apart and brought to a tent [???] and there their old
raiment was taken off [???] but folded and set aside with honour ; and clean linen
was given to them . then [???] came and in his arms [???] to the wonder of
[???] [???] he bore the sword and the elven - cloak and the [???] - coat that had
been taken from him in [???] . for sam he brought a coat of gilded mail [???] and
his elven - cloak all healed of the soils and hurts that it had suffered ; and
then he laid before them two swords .
' i do not wish for any sword [???] ' said [???] .
' tonight at least you should wear one [???] ' said [???] .
then [???] took the small sword that had belonged to sam [???] and had been
laid at his side in [???] ungol . ' sting i gave to you sam [???] ' he said .
' no [???] master ! mr . [???] gave it to you [???] and it goes with his silver
coat ; he would not wish anyone else to wear it now . '
[???] gave way ; and [???] [???] as if he were their esquire [???] knelt and
girt the sword - belts about them [???] and then rising he set circlets of silver
upon their heads . and when they were arrayed they went to the great feast ;
and they sat at the king ' s table with [???] [???] and king jomer of [???] [???] and

the prince [???] and all the chief captains ; and there also were [???] and
legolas .
but when [???] after the standing silence [???] wine was brought there came in
two [???] to serve the kings ; or so they seemed to be : one was clad in
the silver and sable of the guards of minas [???] [???] and the other in white
and green . but sam wondered what such young boys were doing in an army
of
mighty men . then suddenly as they drew near and he could see them plainly [???]
he exclaimed :
' why [???] look mr . [???] ! look here ! well [???] if it isn ' t [???] . mr . [???]
took i should say [???] and mr . merry ! how they have grown ! bless me ! but i
can
see there ' s more tales to tell than ours . '
' there are indeed [???] ' said [???] turning towards him . ' and we ' ll begin
telling them [???] as soon as this feast is ended . in the meantime you can try
[???] . he ' s not so close as he used to be [???] though he laughs now more than
he talks . for the present merry and i are busy . we are knights of the city
and of the mark [???] as i hope you observe . '
at last the glad day ended ; and when the sun was gone and the round
moon rode slowly above the mists of [???] and [???] through the
[???] leaves [???] [???] and sam sat under the whispering trees amid the
fragrance of fair [???] ; and they talked deep into the night with merry
and [???] and [???] [???] and after a while legolas and [???] joined them .
there [???] and sam learned much of all that had happened to the company
after their fellowship was broken on the evil day at parth [???] by [???]
falls ; and still there was always more to ask and more to tell .
[???] [???] and talking trees [???] and leagues of grass [???] and [???] riders .
and glittering caves [???] and white towers and golden halls [???] and battles [???] and
tall ships sailing [???] all these passed before sam ' s mind until he felt
[???] . but [???] all these wonders he returned always to his
astonishment at the size of merry and [???] ; and he made them stand back to
back with [???] and himself . he scratched his head . ' can ' t understand it at
your age ! ' he said . ' but there it is : you ' re three inches taller than you
ought to he [???] or i ' m a dwarf . '
' that you certainly are not [???] ' said [???] . ' but what did i say ? mortals
cannot go drinking ent - draughts and expect no more to come of them than of a
pot of beer . '

' ent - draughts ? ' said sam . ' there you go about ents again ; but what they
are beats me . why [???] it will take weeks before we get all these things sized
up ! '
' weeks indeed [???] ' said [???] . ' and then [???] will have to be locked up
in a tower in minas [???] and write it all down . otherwise he will forget
half of it [???] and poor old [???] will be dreadfully disappointed . '
at length [???] rose . ' the hands of the king are hands of healing [???]
dear friends [???] ' he said . ' but you went to the very brink of death ere he
recalled you [???] putting forth all his power [???] and sent you into the sweet
forgetfulness of sleep . and though you have indeed slept long and blessedly [???]
still it is now time to sleep again . '
and not only sam and [???] here [???] said [???] [???] but you too [???] [???] . i
love you [???] if only because of the pains you have cost me [???] which i shall never
forget . nor shall i forget finding you on the hill of the last battle . but
for [???] the dwarf you would have been lost then . but at least i know now
the look of a hobbit ' s foot [???] though it be all that can be seen under a heap
of bodies . and when i heaved that great carcase off you [???] i made sure you
were dead . i could have . torn out my beard . and it is only a day yet since
you were first up and abroad again . to bed now you go . and so shall i . '
' and i [???] ' said legolas [???] ' shall walk in the woods of this fair land [???]
which is rest enough . in days to come [???] if my elven - lord allows [???] some of our
folk shall remove hither ; and when we come it shall be blessed [???] for a while .
for a while : a month [???] a life [???] a hundred years of men . but [???] is near [???]
and [???] leads down to the sea . to the sea !
to the sea [???] to the sea ! the white gulls are crying [???]
the wind is blowing [???] and the white foam is flying .
west [???] west away [???] the round sun is falling .
grey ship [???] grey ship [???] do you hear them calling .
the voices of my people that have gone before me ?
i will leave [???] i will leave the wo ods that bore me ;
for our days are ending and our years failing .
i will pass the wide waters lonely sailing .
long are the waves on the last shore falling [???]
sweet are the voices in the lost isle calling [???]
in [???] [???] in [???] that no man can discover [???]
where the leaves fall not : land of my people for ever ! '
and so singing legolas went away down the hill .

then the others also departed [???] and [???] and sam went to their beds and
slept . and in the morning they rose again in hope and peace ; and they spent
many days in [???] . for the field of [???] [???] where the host was now
[???] was near to [???] annyn [???] and the stream that flowed from its
falls could be heard in the night as it rushed down through its rocky gate [???]
and passed through the flowery meads into the tides of [???] by the isle of
cair andros . the [???] wandered here and there visiting again the places
that they had passed before ; and sam hoped always in some shadow of the
woods or secret glade to catch [???] maybe [???] a glimpse of the great [???] . and
when he learned that at the siege of [???] there had been a great number of
these beasts but that they were all destroyed [???] he thought it a sad loss .
' well [???] one can ' t be everywhere at once [???] i suppose [???] ' he said . ' but i
missed a lot [???] seemingly . '
in the meanwhile the host made ready for the return to minas [???] .
the weary rested and the hurt were healed . for some had laboured and fought
much with the [???] of the [???] and southrons [???] until all were
subdued . and [???] latest of all [???] those returned who had passed into [???] and
destroyed the fortresses in the north of the land .
but at the last when the month of may was drawing near the captains of
the west set out a gain ; and they went aboard ship with all their men [???] and
they sailed from cair andros down [???] to [???] ; and there they
remained for one day ; and the day after they came to the green fields of the
[???] and saw again the white towers under tall [???] [???] the city of
the men of [???] [???] last memory of westernesse [???] that had passed through the
darkness and fire to a new day .
and there in the midst of the fields they set up their [???] and
[???] the morning ; for it was the eve of may [???] and the king would enter his
gates with the rising of the sun .




chapter 5 . the steward and the king



over the city of [???] doubt and great dread had hung . fair weather
and clear sun had seemed but a mockery to men whose days held little hope [???]
and who looked each morning for news of doom . their lord was dead and
burned [???] dead lay the king of [???] in their [???] [???] and the new king that
had come to them in the night was gone again to a war with powers too dark
and terrible for any might or valour to conquer . and no news came . after the
host left [???] vale and took the northward road beneath the shadow of the
mountains no messenger had returned nor any rumour of what was passing in
the brooding east .
when the captains were but two days gone [???] the lady [???] bade the
women
who tended her to bring her raiment [???] and she would not be gainsaid [???] but
rose ; and when they had clothed her and set her arm in a sling of linen [???] she
went to the warden of the houses of healing .
' sir [???] ' she said [???] ' i am in great unrest [???] and i cannot lie longer in
sloth . '
' lady [???] ' he answered [???] ' you are not yet healed [???] and i was commanded to
tend you with especial care . you should not have risen from your bed for
seven days yet [???] or so i was bidden . i beg you to go back . '
' i am healed [???] ' she said [???] ' healed at least in body [???] save my left arm
only [???] and that is at ease . but i shall sicken anew [???] if there is naught that
i can do . are there no tidings of war ? the women can tell me nothing . '
' there are no tidings [???] ' said the warden [???] ' save that the lords have
ridden to [???] vale ; and men say that the new captain out of the north is
their chief . a great lord is that [???] and a healer ; and it is a thing passing
strange to me that the healing hand should also wield the sword . it is not
thus in [???] now [???] though once it was so [???] if old tales be true . but for
long years we healers have only sought to patch the rents made by the men of
swords . though we should still have enough to do without them : the world is
full enough of hurts and mischances without wars to [???] them . '
it needs but one foe to breed a war [???] not two [???] master warden [???] answered
[???] . ' and those who have not swords can still die upon them . would you
have the folk of [???] gather you herbs only [???] when the dark lord gathers

armies ? and it is not always good to be healed in body . nor is it always
evil to die in battle [???] even in bitter pain . were i permitted [???] in this dark
hour i would choose the latter . '
the warden looked at her . tall she stood there [???] her eyes bright in her
white face [???] her hand [???] as she turned and gazed out of his window that
opened to the east . he sighed and shook his head . after a pause she turned
to him again .
' is there no deed to do ? ' she said . ' who commands in this city ? '
' i do not rightly know [???] ' he answered . ' such things are not my care .
there is a marshal over the riders of [???] ; and the lord h [???] rin [???] i am told [???]
commands the men of [???] . but the lord [???] is by right the steward of
the city . '
' where can i find him ? '
' in this house [???] lady . he was sorely hurt [???] but is now set again on the
way to health . but i do not know - - '
' will you not bring me to him ? then you will know . '
the lord [???] was walking alone in the garden of the houses of
healing [???] and the sunlight warmed him [???] and he felt life run new in his veins ;
but his heart was heavy [???] and he looked out over the walls eastward . and
coming [???] the warden spoke his name [???] and he turned and saw the lady [???]
of
[???] ; and he was moved with pity [???] for he saw that she was hurt [???] and his
clear sight perceived her sorrow and unrest .
' my lord [???] ' said the warden [???] ' here is the lady [???] of [???] . she rode
wi th the king and was sorely hurt [???] and dwells now in my keeping . but she is
not content [???] and she wishes to speak to the steward of the city . '
' do not [???] him [???] lord [???] ' said [???] . ' it is not lack of care
that grieves me . no houses could be fairer [???] for those who desire to be
healed . but i cannot lie in sloth [???] idle [???] caged . i looked for death in
battle . but i have not died [???] and battle still goes on . '
at a sign from [???] [???] the warden bowed and departed . ' what would you
have me do [???] lady ? ' said [???] . ' i also am a prisoner of the healers . ' he
looked at her [???] and being a man whom pity deeply stirred [???] it seemed to him
that her loveliness amid her grief would pierce his heart . and she looked at
him and saw the grave tenderness in his eyes [???] and yet knew [???] for she was bred
among men of war [???] that here was one whom no rider of the mark would
[???]

in battle .
' what do you wish ? ' he said again . ' if it lies in my power [???] i will do
it . '
' i would have you command this warden [???] and bid him let me go [???] ' she
said ; but though her words were still proud [???] her heart faltered [???] and for the
first time she doubted herself . she guessed that this tall man [???] both stern
and gentle [???] might think her merely wayward [???] like a child that has not the
firmness of mind to go on with a dull task to the end .
' i myself am in the warden ' s keeping [???] ' answered [???] . ' nor have i
yet taken up my authority in the city . but had i done so [???] i should still
listen to his counsel [???] and should not cross his will in matters of his
craft [???] unless in some great need . '
' but i do not desire healing [???] ' she said . ' i wish to ride to war like my
brother jomer [???] or better like [???] the king [???] for he died and has both
honour and peace . '
' it is too late [???] lady [???] to follow the captains [???] even if you had the
strength [???] ' said [???] . ' but death in battle may come to us all yet [???]
willing or unwilling . you will be better prepared to face it in your own
manner [???] if while there is still time you do as the healer commanded . you and
i [???] we must endure with patience the hours of waiting . '
she did not answer [???] but as he looked at her it seemed to him that
something in her softened [???] as though a bitter frost were yielding at the
first faint presage of spring . a tear sprang in her eye and fell down her
cheek [???] like a [???] rain - drop . her proud head drooped a little . then
quietly [???] more as if speaking to herself than to him : ' but the healers would
have me lie abed seven days yet [???] ' she said . ' and my window does not look
eastward . ' her voice was now that of a maiden young and sad .
[???] smiled [???] though his heart was filled with pity . ' your window
does not look eastward ? ' he said . ' that can be amended . in this i will
command the warden . if you will stay in this house in our care [???] lady [???] and
take your rest [???] then you shall walk in this garden in the sun [???] as you will ;
and you shall look east [???] whither all our hopes have gone . and here you will
find me [???] walking and waiting [???] and also looking east . it would ease my care [???]
if you would speak to me [???] or walk at whiles with me . '
then she raised her head and looked him in the eyes again ; and a colour
came in her pale face . ' how should i ease your care [???] my lord ? ' she said .
' and i do not desire the speech of living men . '

' would you have my plain answer ? ' he said .
' i would . '
' then [???] [???] of [???] [???] i say to you that you are beautiful . in the
[???] of our hills there are flowers fair and bright [???] and maidens fairer
still ; but neither flower nor lady have i seen till now in [???] so lovely [???]
and so sorrowful . it may be that only a few days are left ere darkness falls
upon our world [???] and when it comes i hope to face it steadily ; but it would
ea se my heart [???] if while the sun yet shines [???] i could see you still . for you
and i have both passed under the wings of the shadow [???] and the same hand drew
us back . '
' alas [???] not me [???] lord ! ' she said . ' shadow lies on me still . look not to
me for healing ! i am a [???] and my hand is [???] . but i thank you
for this at least [???] that i need not keep to my chamber . i will walk abroad by
the grace of the steward of the city . ' and she did him a courtesy and walked
back to the house . but [???] for a long while walked alone in the garden [???]
and his glance now strayed rather to the house than to the eastward walls .
when he returned to his chamber he called for the warden [???] and heard all
that he could tell of the lady of [???] .
' but i doubt not [???] lor d [???] ' said the warden [???] ' that you would learn more
from the halfling that is with us ; for he was in the riding of the king [???] and
with the lady at the end [???] they say . '
and so merry was sent to [???] [???] and while that day lasted they talked
long together [???] and [???] learned much [???] more even than merry put into
words ; and he thought that he understood now something of the grief and
unrest of [???] of [???] . and in the fair evening [???] and merry walked
in the garden [???] but she did not come .
but in the morning [???] as [???] came from the houses [???] he saw her [???] as she
stood upon the walls ; and she was clad all in white [???] and gleamed in the sun .
and he called to her [???] and she came down [???] and they walked on the grass or sat
under a green tree together [???] now in silence [???] now in speech . and each day
after they did likewise . and the warden looking from his window was glad in
heart . for he was a healer . and his care was lightened ; and certain it was
that [???] heavy as was the dread and [???] of those days upon the hearts of
men [???] still these two of his charges prospered and grew daily in strength .
and so the fifth day came since the lady [???] went first to [???] ;
and they stood now together once more upon the walls of the city and looked
out . no tidings had yet come [???] and all hearts were darkened . the weather [???]

too [???] was bright no longer . it was cold . a wind that had sprung up in the
night was blowing now keenly from the north [???] and it was rising ; but the
lands about looked grey and dr ear .
they were clad in warm raiment and heavy cloaks [???] and over all the lady
[???] wore a great blue mantle of the colour of deep summer - night [???] and it
was set with silver stars about hem and throat . [???] had sent for this
robe and had wrapped it about her ; and he thought that she looked fair and
queenly indeed as she stood there at his side . the mantle was wrought for
his mother [???] [???] of amroth [???] who died untimely [???] and was to him but a
memory of loveliness in far days and of his first grief ; and her robe seemed
to him raiment fitting for the beauty and sadness of [???] .
but she now shivered beneath the starry mantle [???] and she looked
northward [???] above the grey hither lands [???] into the eye of the cold wind where
far away the sky was hard and clear .
' what do you look for [???] [???] ? ' said [???] .
' does not the black gate lie yonder ? ' said she . ' and must he not now be
come thither ? it is seven days since he rode away . '
' seven days [???] ' said [???] . ' but think not il l of me [???] if i say to you :
they have brought me both a joy and a pain that i never thought to know . joy
to see you ; but pain [???] because now the fear and doubt of this evil time are
grown dark indeed . [???] [???] i would not have this world end now [???] or lose so
soon what i have found . '
' lose what you have found [???] lord ? ' she answered ; but she looked at him
gravely and her eyes were kind . ' i know not what in these days you have
found that you could lose . but come [???] my friend [???] let us not speak of it ! let
us not speak at all ! i stand upon some dreadful brink [???] and it is utterly
dark in the [???] before my feet [???] but whether there is any light behind me i
cannot tell . for i cannot turn yet . i wait for some stroke of doom . '
' yes [???] we wait for the stroke of doom [???] ' said [???] . and they said no
more ; and it seemed to them as they stood upon the wall that the wind died [???]
and the light failed [???] and the sun was bleared [???] and all sounds in the city or
in the lands about were hushed : neither wind [???] nor voice [???] nor bird - call [???] nor
rustle of leaf [???] nor their own breath could be heard ; the very beating of
their hearts was stilled . time halted .
and as they stood so [???] their hands met and clasped [???] though they did not
know it . and still they waited for they knew not what . then presently it
seemed to them that above the ridges of the distant mountains another vast

mountain of darkness rose [???] towering up like a wave that should engulf the
world [???] and about it lightnings [???] ; and then a tremor ran through the
earth [???] and they felt the walls of the city quiver . a sound like a sigh went
up from all the lands about them ; and their hearts beat suddenly again .
' it reminds me of n [???] menor [???] ' said [???] [???] and wondered to hear himself
speak .
' of n [???] menor ? ' said [???] .
' yes [???] ' said [???] [???] ' of the land of westernesse that foundered and of
the great dark wave climbing over the green lands and above the hills [???] and
coming on [???] darkness [???] . i often dream of it . '
' then you think that the darkness is coming ? ' said [???] . ' darkness
[???] ? ' and suddenly she drew close to him .
' no [???] ' said [???] [???] looking into her face . ' it was but a picture in the
mind . i do not know what is happening . the reason of my waking mind tells
me
that great evil has befallen and we stand at the end of days . but my heart
says nay ; and all my limbs are light [???] and a hope and joy are come to me that
no reason can deny . [???] [???] [???] [???] white lady of [???] [???] in this hour i do not
believe that any darkness will endure ! ' and he stooped and kissed her brow .
and so they stood on the walls of the city of [???] [???] and a great wind
rose and blew [???] and their hair [???] raven and golden [???] streamed out mingling in
the air . and the shadow departed [???] and the sun was [???] [???] and light leaped
forth ; and the waters of [???] shone like silver [???] and in all the houses of
the city men sang for the joy that welled up in their hearts from what
source they could not tell .
and before the sun had fallen far from the noon out of the east there
came a great eagle flying [???] and he bore tidings beyond hope from the lords of
the west [???] crying :
sing now [???] ye people of the tower of anor [???]
for the realm of [???] is ended for ever [???]
and the dark tower is thrown down .

sing and rejoice [???] ye people of the tower of guard [???]
for your watch hath not been in vain [???]
and the black gate is broken [???]
and your king hath passed through [???]
and he is victorious .


sing and be glad [???] all ye children of the west [???]
for your king shall come again [???]
and he shall dwell among you
all the days of your life .

and the tree that was withered shall be renewed [???]
and he shall plant it in the high places [???]
and the city shall be blessed .

sing all ye people !
and the people sang in all the ways of the city .
the days that followed were golden [???] and spring and summer joined and
made revel together in the fields of [???] . and tidings now came by swift
riders from cair andros of all that was done [???] and the city made ready for
the coming of the king . merry was summoned and rode away with the wains
that
took store of goods to [???] and thence by ship to cair andros ; but
[???] did not go [???] for now being healed he took upon him his authority and
the stewardship [???] although it was only for a little while [???] and his duty was
to prepare for one who should replace him .
and [???] did not go [???] though her brother sent word begging her to come
to the field of [???] . and [???] wondered at this [???] but he saw her
seldom [???] being busy with many matters ; and she dwelt still in the houses of
healing and walked alone in the garden [???] and her face grew pale again [???] and it
seemed that in all the city she only was ailing and sorrowful . and the
warden of the houses was troubled [???] and he spoke to [???] .
then [???] came and sought her [???] and once more they stood on the walls
together ; and he said to her : ' [???] [???] why do you tarry here [???] and do not go
to the rejoicing in [???] beyond cair andros [???] where your brother [???]
you ? '
and she said : ' do you not know ? '
but he answered : ' two reasons there may be [???] but which is true [???] l do not
know . '
and she said : ' i do not wish to play at [???] . speak plainer ! '
' then if you will have it so [???] lady [???] ' he said : ' you do not go [???] because
only your brother called for you [???] and to look on the lord [???] [???] [???] ' s

heir [???] in his triumph would now bring you no joy . or because i do not go [???] and
you desire still to be near me . and maybe for both these reasons [???] and you
yourself cannot choose between them . [???] [???] do you not love me [???] or will you
not ? '
' i wished to be loved by another [???] ' she answered . ' but i desire no man ' s
pity . '
' that i know [???] ' he said . ' you desired to have the love of the lord
[???] . because he was high and puissant [???] and you wished to have renown
and
glory and to be lifted far above the mean things that [???] on the earth .
and as a great captain may to a young soldier he seemed to you admirable .
for so he is [???] a lord among men [???] the greatest that now is . but when he gave
you only understanding and pity [???] then you desired to have nothing [???] unless a
brave death in battle . look at me [???] [???] ! '
and [???] looked at [???] long and steadily ; and [???] said : ' do
not scorn pity that is the gift of a gentle heart [???] [???] ! but i do not offer
you my pity . for you are a lady high and valiant and have yourself won
renown that shall not be forgotten ; and you are a lady beautiful [???] i deem [???]
beyond even the words of the elven - tongue to tell . and i love you . once i
pitied your sorrow . but now [???] were you sorrowless [???] without fear or any lack [???]
were you the blissful queen of [???] [???] still i would love you . [???] [???] do you
not love me ? '
then the heart of [???] changed [???] or else at last she understood it . and
suddenly her winter passed [???] and the sun shone on her .
i stand in minas anor [???] the tower of the sun [???] she said ; and behold the
shadow has departed ! i will be a [???] no longer [???] nor vie with the
great riders [???] nor take joy only in the songs of slaying . i will be a healer [???]
and love all things that grow and are not barren . ' and again she looked at
[???] . ' no longer do i desire to be a queen [???] ' she said .
then [???] laughed merrily . ' that is well [???] ' he said ; ' for i am not a
king . yet i will wed with the white lady of [???] [???] if it be her will . and if
she will [???] then let us cross the river and in happier days let us dwell in
fair [???] and there make a garden . all things will grow with joy there [???]
if the white lady comes . '
' then must i leave my own people [???] man of [???] ? ' she said . ' and would
you have your proud folk say of you : ( there goes a lord who tamed a wild
[???] of the north ! was there no woman of the race of n [???] menor to

choose ? ( '
' i would [???] ' said [???] . and he took her in his arms and kissed her
under the [???] sky [???] and he cared not that they stood high upon the walls
in the sight of many . and many indeed saw them and the light that shone
about them as they came down from the walls and went hand in hand to the
houses of healing .
and to the warden of the houses [???] said : ' here is the lady [???]
of [???] [???] and now she is healed . '
and the warden said : ' then i release her from my charge and bid her
farewell [???] and may she suffer never hurt nor sickness again . i commend her to
the care of the steward of the city [???] until her brother returns . '
but [???] said : ' yet now that i have leave to depart [???] i would remain .
for this house has become to me of all dwellings the most blessed . ' and she
remained there until king jomer came .
all things were now made ready in the city ; and there was great
concourse of people [???] for the tidings had gone out into all parts of [???] [???]
from min - [???] even to [???] gelin and the far coasts of the sea ; and all
that could come to the city made haste to come . and the city was filled
again with women and fair children that returned to their homes laden with
flowers ; and from dol amroth came the harpers that harped most [???] in
all the land ; and there were players upon viols and upon flutes and upon
horns of silver [???] and clear - voiced singers from the vales of [???] .
at last an evening came when from the walls the [???] could be seen
upon the field [???] and all night lights were burning as men watched for the
dawn . and when the sun rose in the clear morning above the mountains in the
east [???] upon which shadows lay no more [???] then all the bells rang [???] and all the
banners broke and flowed in the wind ; and upon the white tower of the
[???] the standard of the stewards [???] bright argent like snow in the sun [???]
bearing no charge nor device [???] was raised over [???] for the last time .
now the captains of the west led their host towards the city [???] and folk
saw them advance in line upon line [???] flashing and [???] in the [???] and
[???] like silver . and so they came before the gateway and halted a
furlong from the walls . as yet no gates had been set up again [???] but a barrier
was laid across the entrance to the city [???] and there stood men at arms in
silver and black with long swords drawn . before the barrier stood [???]
the steward [???] and h [???] rin warden of the keys [???] and other captains of [???] [???] and
the lady [???] of [???] with [???] the marshal and many knights of the

mark ; and upon either side of the gate was a great press of fair people in
raiment of many colours and garlands of flowers .
so now there was a wide space before the walls of minas [???] [???] and it
was hemmed in upon all sides by the knights and the soldiers of [???] and
of [???] [???] and by the people of the city and of all parts of the land . a hush
fell upon all as out from the host stepped the d [???] nedain in silver and grey ;
and before them came walking slow the lord [???] . he was clad in black
mail girt with silver [???] and he wore a long mantle of pure white clasped at
the throat with a great jewel of green that shone from afar ; but his head
was bare save for a star upon his forehead bound by a slender fillet of
silver . with him were jomer of [???] [???] and the prince [???] [???] and [???]
robed all in white [???] and four small figures that many men marvelled to see .
' nay [???] cousin ! they are not boys [???] ' said [???] to her [???] from
[???] [???] [???] who stood beside her . ' those are [???] [???] out of the far
country of the halflings [???] where they are princes of great fame [???] it is said .
i should know [???] for i had one to tend in the houses . they are small [???] but they
are valiant . why [???] cousin [???] one of them went with only his esquire into the
black country and fought with the dark lord all by himself [???] and set fire to
his tower [???] if you can believe it . at least that is the tale in the city .
that will be the one that walks with our [???] . they are dear friends [???] i
hear . now he is a marvel [???] the lord [???] : not too soft in his speech [???]
mind you [???] but he has a golden heart [???] as the saying is ; and he has the
healing hands . ( the hands of the king are the hands of a healer ( [???] i said ;
and that was how it was all discovered . and [???] [???] he said to me :
( [???] [???] men will long remember your words ( [???] and - - '
but [???] was not permitted to continue the instruction of her
[???] from the country [???] for a single trumpet rang [???] and a dead silence
followed . then forth from the gate went [???] with h [???] rin of the keys [???] and
no others [???] save that behind them walked four men in the high helms and
armour of the [???] [???] and they bore a great casket of black [???] bound
with silver .
[???] met [???] in the midst of those there assembled [???] and he
knelt [???] and said : ' the last steward of [???] begs leave to [???] his
office . ' and he held out a white rod ; but [???] took the rod and gave it
back [???] saying : ' that office is not ended [???] and it shall be thine and thy
heirs ' as long as my line shall last . do now thy office ! '
then [???] stood up and spoke in a clear voice : ' men of [???] hear

now the steward of this realm ! behold ! one has come to claim the kingship
again at last . here is [???] son of [???] [???] chieftain of the d [???] nedain of
[???] [???] captain of the host of the west [???] bearer of the star of the north [???]
[???] of the sword [???] [???] victorious in battle [???] whose hands bring
healing [???] the [???] [???] [???] of the line of [???] [???] [???] ' s son [???]
[???] ' s son of n [???] menor . shall he be king and enter into the city and dwell
there ? '
and all the host and all the people cried yea with one voice .
and [???] said to her [???] : ' this is just a ceremony such as we
have in the city [???] cousin ; for he has already entered [???] as i was telling you ;
and he said to me - - ' and then again she was obliged to silence [???] for [???]
spoke again .
' men of [???] [???] the [???] tell that it was the custom of old that
the king should receive the crown from his father ere he died ; or if that
might not be [???] that he should go alone and take it from the hands of his
father in the tomb where he was laid . but since things must now be done
otherwise [???] using the authority of the steward [???] i have today brought hither
from rath [???] the crown of [???] the last king [???] whose days passed in the
time of our [???] of old . '
then the guards stepped forward [???] and [???] opened the casket [???] and he
held up an ancient crown . it was shaped like the helms of the guards of the
[???] [???] save that it was [???] [???] and it was all white [???] and the wings at
either side were wrought of pearl and silver in the likeness of the wings of
a sea - bird [???] for it was the [???] of kings who came over the sea ; and seven
gems of adamant were set in the circlet [???] and upon its summit was set a
single jewel the light of which went up like a flame .
then [???] took the crown and held it up and said :
et [???] [???] ut [???] lien . sinome [???] ar [???] tenn '
ambar - metta !
and those were the words that [???] spoke when he came up out of the
sea on the wings of the wind : ' out of the great sea to m iddle - earth i am
come . in this place will i abide [???] and my heirs [???] unto the ending of the
world . '
then to the wonder of many [???] did not put the crown upon his head [???]
but gave it back to [???] [???] and said : ' by the labour and valour of many i
have come into my inheritance . in token of this i would have the ring - bearer
bring the crown to me [???] and let [???] set it upon my head [???] if he will ;

for he has been the mover of all that has been accomplished [???] and this is his
victory . '
then [???] came forward and took the crown from [???] and bore it to
[???] ; and [???] knelt [???] and [???] set the white crown upon his head [???]
and said :
' now come the days of the king [???] and may they be blessed while the
thrones of the valar endure ! '
but when [???] arose all that beheld him gazed in silence [???] for it
seemed to them that he was revealed to them now for the first time . tall as
the sea - kings of old [???] he stood above all that were near ; ancient of days he
seemed and yet in the fl ower of manhood ; and wisdom sat upon his brow [???] and
strength and healing were in his hands [???] and a light was about him . and then
[???] cried :
' behold the king ! '
and in that moment all the trumpets were blown [???] and the king [???]
went forth and came to the barrier [???] and h [???] rin of the keys thrust it back ;
and amid the music of harp and of viol and of flute and the singing of clear
voices the king passed through the flower - laden streets [???] and came to the
[???] [???] and entered in ; and the banner of the tree and the stars was
[???] upon the topmost tower [???] and the reign of king [???] began [???] of
which many songs have told .
in his time the city was made more fair than it had ever been [???] even in
the days of its first glory ; and it was filled with trees and with
fountains [???] and its gates were wrought of [???] and steel [???] and its streets
were paved with white marble ; and the folk of the mountain laboured in it [???]
and the folk of the wood rejoiced to come there ; and all was healed and made
good [???] and the houses were filled with men and women and the laughter of
children [???] and no window was blind nor any courtyard empty ; and after the
ending of the third age of the world into the new age it preserved the
memory and the glory of the years that were gone .
in the days that followed his crowning the king sat on his throne in
the hall of the kings and pronounced his judgements . and embassies came
from
many lands and peoples [???] from the east and the south [???] and from the borders of
[???] [???] and from dunland in the west . and the king pardoned the
[???] that had given themselves up [???] and sent them away free [???] and he
made peace with the peoples of harad ; and the slaves of [???] he released

and gave to them all the lands about lake n [???] [???] to be their own . and there
were brought before him many to receive his praise and reward for their
valour ; and last the captain of the guard brought to him [???] to be
judged .
and the king said to [???] : ' [???] [???] by your sword blood was
spilled in the hallows [???] where that is forbidden . also you left your post
without leave of lord or of captain . for these things [???] of old [???] death was the
penalty . now therefore i must pronounce your doom .
' all penalty is remitted for your valour in battle [???] and still more
because all that you did was for the love of the lord [???] . nonetheless
you must leave the guard of the [???] [???] and you must go forth from the city
of minas [???] . '
then the blood left [???] ' s face [???] and he was [???] to the heart
and bowed his head . but the king said . :
' so it must be [???] for you are appointed to the white company [???] the guard
of [???] [???] prince of [???] [???] and you shall be its captain and dwell in
emyn [???] in honour and peace [???] and in the service of him for whom you
risked all [???] to save him from death . '
and then [???] [???] perceiving the mercy and justice of the king [???] was
glad [???] and kneeling kissed his hand [???] and departed in joy and content . and
[???] gave to [???] [???] to be his princedom [???] and bade him dwell in
the hills of emyn [???] within sight of the city .
' for [???] ' said he [???] ' minas [???] in [???] vale shall be utterly destroyed [???]
and though it may in time to come be made clean [???] no man may dwell there for
many long years . '
and last of all [???] greeted jomer of [???] [???] and they embraced [???] and
[???] said : ' between us there can be no word of giving or taking [???] nor of
reward ; for we are brethren . in happy hour did [???] ride from the north [???] and
never has any league of peoples been more blessed [???] so that neither has ever
failed the other [???] nor shall fail . now [???] as you know [???] we have laid [???] the
renowned in a tomb in the hallows [???] and there he shall lie for ever among the
kings of [???] [???] if you will . or if you desire it [???] we will come to [???] and
bring him back to rest with his own people . '
and jomer answered : ' since the day when you rose before me out of the
green grass of the downs i have loved you [???] and that love shall not fail . but
now i must depart for a while to my own realm [???] where there is much to heal
and set in order . but as for the fallen [???] when all is made ready we will

return for him ; but here let him sleep a while . '
and [???] said to [???] : ' now i must go back to my own land and look
on it once again [???] and help my brother in his labour ; but when one whom i
long loved as father is laid at last to rest [???] i will return . '
so the glad days passed ; and on the eighth day o f may the riders of
[???] made ready [???] and rode off by the north - way [???] and with them went the
sons
of [???] . all the road was lined with people to do them honour and praise
them [???] from the gate of the city to the walls of the [???] . then all
others that dwelt afar went back to their homes rejoicing ; but in the city
there was labour of many willing hands to rebuild and renew and to remove
all the scars of war and the memory of the darkness .
the [???] still remained in minas [???] [???] with legolas and [???] ; for
[???] was loth for the fellowship to be dissolved . ' at last all such
things must end [???] ' he said [???] ' but i would have you wait a little while longer :
for the end of the deeds that you have shared in has not yet come . a day
draws near that i have looked for in all the years of my manhood [???] and when
it comes i would have my friends beside me . ' but of that day he would say no
more .
in those days the companions of the ring dwelt together in a fair house
with [???] [???] and they went to and fro as they wished . and [???] said to
[???] : ' do you know what this day is that [???] speaks of ? for we are
happy here [???] and i don ' t wish to go ; but the days are running away [???] and [???]
is waiting ; and the shire is my home . '
' as for [???] [???] ' said [???] [???] ' he is waiting for the same day [???] and he
knows what keeps you . and as for the passing of the days [???] it is now only may
and high summer is not yet in ; and though all things may seem changed [???] as if
an age of the world had gone by [???] yet to the trees and the grass it is less
than a year since you set out . '
' [???] [???] ' said [???] [???] ' didn ' t you say that [???] was less close than
of old ? he was weary of his labours then [???] i think . now he is recovering . '
and [???] said : ' many folk like to know beforehand what is to be set
on the table ; but those who have laboured to prepare the feast like to keep
their secret ; for wonder makes the words of praise louder . and [???]
himself waits for a sign . '
there came a day when [???] could not be found [???] and the companions

wondered what was going forward . but [???] took [???] out from the
city
by night [???] and he brought him to the southern feet of mount [???] ; and
there they found a path made in ages past that few now dared to tread . for
it led up on to the mountain to a high hallow where only the kings had been
wont to go . and they went up by steep ways [???] until they came to a high field
below the snows that clad the lofty peaks [???] and it looked down over the
[???] that stood behind the city . and standing there they surveyed the
lands [???] for the morning was come ; and they saw the towers of the city far
below them like white pencils touched by the sunlight [???] and all the vale of
[???] was like a garden [???] and the mountains of shadow were veiled in a
golden mist . upon the one side their sight reached to the grey emyn muil [???]
and the glint of [???] was like a star [???] far off ; and upon the
other side they saw the river like a ribbon laid down to [???] [???] and
beyond that was a light on the hem of the sky that spoke of the sea .
and [???] said : ' this is your realm [???] and the heart of the greater
realm that shall be . the third age of the world is ended [???] and the new age is
begun ; and it is your task to order its beginning and to preserve what may
be preserved . for though much has been saved [???] much must now pass away ;
and
the power of the three rings also is ended . and all the lands that you see [???]
and those that lie round about them [???] shall be dwellings of men . for the time
comes of the dominion of men [???] and the elder kindred shall fade or depart . '
' i know it well [???] dear friend [???] ' said [???] ; ' but i would still have
your counsel . '
' not for long now [???] ' said [???] . ' the third age was my age . i was the
enemy of [???] ; and my work is finished . i shall go soon . the burden must
lie now upon you and your kindred . '
' but i shall die [???] ' said [???] . ' for i am a mortal man [???] and though
being what i am and of the race of the west [???] [???] i shall have life far
longer than other men [???] yet that is but a little while ; and when those who
are now in the wombs of women are born and have grown old [???] i too shall grow
old . and who then shall govern [???] and those who look to this city as to
their queen [???] if my desire be not granted ? the tree in the court of the
fountain is still withered and barren . when shall i see a sign that it will
ever be otherwise ? '
' turn your face from the green world [???] and look where all seems barren

and cold ! ' said [???] .
then [???] turned . and there was a stony slope behind him running
down from the skirts of the snow ; and as he looked he was aware that alone
there in the waste a growing thing stood . and he climbed to it [???] and saw that
out of the very edge of the snow there sprang a sapling tree no more than
three foot high . already it had put forth young leaves long and shapely [???]
dark above and silver beneath [???] and upon its slender crown it bore one small
[???] of flowers whose white petals shone like the [???] snow .
then [???] cried : ' yj ! ut [???] [???] ! i have found it ! lo ! here is a
scion of the eldest of trees ! but how comes it here ? for it is not itself
yet seven years old . '
and [???] coming looked at it [???] and said : ' verily this is a sapling of
the line of [???] the fair ; and that was a seedling of [???] [???] and
that a fruit of [???] of many names [???] eldest of trees . who shall say how
it comes here in the appointed hour ? but this is an ancient hallow [???] and ere
the kings failed or the tree withered in the court [???] a fruit must have been
set here . for it is said that [???] though the fruit of the tree comes seldom to
ripeness [???] yet the life within may then lie sleeping through many long years [???]
and none can foretell the time in which it will awake . remember this . for if
ever a fruit ripens [???] it should be planted [???] lest the line die out of the
world . here it has lain . hidden on the mountain [???] even as the race of [???]
lay hidden in the wastes of the north . yet the line of [???] is older far
than your line [???] king [???] . '
then [???] laid his hand gently to the sapling [???] and lo ! it seemed to
hold only lightly to the earth [???] and it was removed without hurt ; and [???]
bore it back to the [???] . then the withered tree was [???] [???] but with
reverence ; and they did not burn it [???] but laid it to rest in the silence of
rath [???] . and [???] planted the new tree in the court by the fountain [???]
and swiftly and gladly it began to grow ; and when the month of june entered
in it was laden with blossom .
' the sign has been given [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and the day is not far off . '
and he set watchmen upon the walls .
it was the day before [???] when messengers came from amon d ( n
to
the city [???] and they said that there was a riding of fair folk out of the
north [???] and they drew near now to the walls of the [???] . and the king
said : ' at last they have come . let all the city be made ready ! '

upon the very eve of [???] [???] when the sky was blue as [???] and
white stars opened in the east [???] but the west was still golden and the air
was cool and fragrant [???] the riders came down the north - way to the gates of
minas [???] . first rode [???] and [???] with a banner of silver [???] and
then came [???] and [???] and all the household of [???] [???] and
after them came the lady [???] and [???] [???] lord of [???] [???] riding
upon white steeds and with them many fair folk of their land [???] grey - cloaked
with white gems in their hair ; and last came master [???] [???] mighty among
elves and men [???] bearing the sceptre of ann [???] minas [???] and beside him upon a
grey
[???] rode [???] his daughter [???] [???] of her people .
and [???] when he saw her come [???] in the evening [???] with stars on
her brow and a sweet fragrance about her [???] was moved with great wonder [???] and
he said to [???] : ' at last i understand why we have waited ! this is the
ending . now not day only shall be beloved [???] but night too shall be beautiful
and blessed and all its fear pass away ! '
then the king welcomed his guests [???] and they alighted ; and [???]
[???] the sceptre [???] and laid the hand of his daughter in the hand of
the king [???] and together they went up into the high city [???] and a ll the stars
flowered in the sky . and [???] the king [???] wedded [???] [???]
in
the city of the kings upon the day of [???] [???] and the tale of their long
waiting and labours was come to [???] .




chapter 6 . many partings



when the days of rejoicing were over at last the companions thought of
returning to their own homes . and [???] went to the king as he was sitting
with the queen [???] by the fountain [???] and she sang a song of valinor [???] while
the tree grew and blossomed . they welcomed [???] and rose to greet him ;
and
[???] said :
' i know what you have come to say [???] [???] : you wish to return to your
own home . well [???] dearest friend [???] the tree grows best in the land of its
sires ; but for you in all the lands of the west there will ever be a
welcome . and though your people have had little fame in the [???] of the
great [???] they will now have more renown than any wide realms that are no
more . '
' it is true that i wish to go back to the shire [???] ' said [???] . ' but
first i must go to [???] . for if there could be anything wanting in a
time so blessed [???] i missed [???] ; and i was grieved when among all the
household of [???] i saw that he was not come . '
' do you wonder at that [???] ring - bearer ? ' said [???] . ' for you know the
power of that thing which is now destroyed ; and all that was done by that
power is now passing away . but your kinsman possessed this thing longer than
you . he is ancient in years now [???] according to his kind ; and he [???] you [???]
for he will not again make any long journey save one . '
' then i beg leave to depart soon [???] ' said [???] .
' in seven days we will go [???] ' said [???] . ' for we shall ride with you
far on the road [???] even as far as the country of [???] . in three days now
jomer will return hither to bear [???] back to rest in the mark [???] and we
shall ride with him to honour the fallen . but now before you go i will
confirm the words that [???] spoke to you [???] and you are made free for ever
of the realm of [???] ; and all your companions likewise . and if there were
any gifts that i could give to match with your deeds you should have them ;
but whatever you desire you shall take with you [???] and you shall ride in
honour and arrayed as princes of the land . '
but the queen [???] said : ' a gift i will give you . for i am the
daughter of [???] . i shall not go with him now when he departs to the

havens ; for mine is the choice of l [???] thien [???] and as she so have i chosen [???] both
the sweet and the bitter . but in my stead you shall go [???] ring - bearer [???] when
the time comes [???] and if you then desire it . if your hurts grieve you still
and the memory of your burden is heavy [???] then you may pass into the west [???]
until all your wounds and weariness are hea led . but wear this now in memory
of [???] and [???] with whom your life has been woven ! '
and she took a white gem like a star that lay upon her breast hanging
upon a silver chain [???] and she set the chain about [???] ' s neck . ' when the
memory of the fear and the darkness troubles you [???] ' she said [???] ' this will
bring you aid . '
in three days [???] as the king had said [???] jomer of [???] came riding to the
city [???] and with him came an jored of the fairest knights of the mark . he was
welcomed ; and when they sat all at table in [???] [???] the great hall of
feasts [???] he beheld the beauty of the ladies that he saw and was filled with
great wonder . and before he went to his rest he sent for [???] the dwarf [???]
and he said to him : ' [???] [???] ' s son [???] have you your axe ready ? '
' nay [???] lord [???] ' said [???] [???] ' but i can speedily fetch it [???] if there be
need . '
' you shall judge [???] ' said jomer . ' for there are certain rash words
concerning the lady in the golden wood that lie still between us . and now i
have seen her with my eyes . '
' well [???] lord [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and what say you now ? '
' alas ! ' said jomer . ' i will not say that she is the fairest lady that
lives . '
' then i must go for my axe [???] ' said [???] .
' but first i will plead this excuse [???] ' said jomer . ' had i seen her in
other company [???] i would have said all that you could wish . but now i will put
queen [???] [???] first [???] and i am ready to do battle on my own part with
any who deny me . shall i call for my sword ? '
then [???] bowed low . ' nay [???] you are excused for my part [???] lord [???] ' he
said . ' you have chosen the evening ; but my love is given to the morning . and
my heart [???] that soon it will past away for ever . '
at last the day of departure came [???] and a great and fair company made
ready to ride north from the city . then the kings of [???] and [???] went
to the hallows and they came to the tombs in rath [???] [???] and they bore away
king [???] upon a golden bier [???] and passed through the city in silence .
then they laid the bier upon a great wain with riders of [???] all about it

and his banner borne before ; and merry being [???] ' s esquire rode upon the
wain and kept the arms of the king .
for the other companions steeds were furnished according to their
stature ; and [???] and [???] rode at [???] ' s side [???] and [???] rode upon
[???] [???] and [???] rode with the knights of [???] ; and legolas and
[???]
as ever rode together upon arod .
in that riding went also queen [???] [???] and [???] and [???] with
their folk [???] and [???] and his sons ; and the princes of dol amroth and of
[???] [???] and many captains and knights . never had any king of the mark such
company upon the road as went with [???] [???] ' s son to the land of his
home .
without haste and at peace they passed into [???] [???] and they came to
the grey wood under amon d ( n ; and there they heard a sound as of drums
beating in the hills [???] though no living thing could be seen . then [???] let
the trumpets be blown ; and heralds cried :
' behold the king [???] is come ! the forest of dr [???] adan he gives to
[???] - buri - [???] and to his folk [???] to be their own for ever ; and hereafter let
no man enter it without their leave ! '
then the drums rolled loudly [???] and were silent .
at length after fifteen days of journey the wain of king [???] passed
through the green fields of [???] and came to [???] ; and there they all
rested . the golden hall was arrayed with fair hangings and it was filled
with light [???] and there was held the highest feast that it had known since the
days of its building . for after three days the men of the mark prepared the
funeral of [???] ; and he was laid in a house of stone with his arms and
many other fair things that he had possessed [???] and over him was raised a
great mound [???] covered with green turves of grass and of white [???] . and
now there were eight mounds on the east - side of the [???] .
then the riders of the king ' s house upon white horses rode round about
the barrow and sang together a song of [???] [???] ' s son that [???]
his [???] made [???] and he made no other song after . the slow voices of the
riders stirred the hearts even of those who did not know the speech of that
people ; but the words of the song brought a light to the eyes of the folk of
the mark as they heard again afar the thunder of the [???] of the north and
the voice of [???] crying above the battle upon the field of celebrant ; and
the tale of the kings rolled on [???] and the horn of helm was loud in the

mountains [???] until the darkness came and king [???] arose and rode through
the shadow to the fire [???] and died in [???] [???] even as the sun [???] returning
beyond hope [???] gleamed upon [???] in the morning .
out of doubt [???] out of dark [???] to the day ' s rising
he rode singing in the sun [???] sword [???] .
hope he [???] [???] and in hope ended ;
over death [???] over dread [???] over doom lifted
out of loss [???] out of life [???] unto long glory .
but merry stood at the foot of the green mound [???] and he wept [???] and when
the song was ended he arose and cried :
' [???] king [???] [???] king ! farewell ! as a father you were to me . for
a little while . farewell ! '
when the burial was over and the weeping of women was stilled [???] and
[???] was left at last alone in his barrow [???] then folk gathered to the
golden hall for the great feast and put away sorrow ; for [???] had lived
to full years and ended in honour no less than the greatest of his sires .
and when the time came that in the custom of the mark they should drink to
the memory of the kings [???] [???] lady of [???] came forth [???] golden as the sun
and white as snow [???] and she bore a filled cup to jomer .
then a [???] and [???] stood up and named all the names of the
lords of the mark in their order : [???] the young ; and brego builder of the
hall ; and [???] brother of baldor the hapless ; and [???] [???] and [???] [???] and
[???] [???] and [???] [???] and gram ; and helm who lay hid in helm ' s deep when
the
mark was [???] ; and so ended the nine mounds of the west - side [???] for in that
time the line was broken [???] and after came the mounds of the east - side :
[???] [???] helm s sister - son [???] and [???] [???] and [???] [???] and [???] [???] and [???] [???]
and [???] [???] and [???] [???] and [???] the latest . and when [???] was
named
jomer drained the cup . then [???] bade those that served to fill the cups [???]
and all there assembled rose and drank to the new king [???] crying : ' hail [???]
jomer [???] king of the mark ! '
at the last when the feast drew to an end jomer arose and said : ' now
this is the funeral feast of [???] the king ; but i will speak ere we go of
tidings of joy [???] for he would not grudge that i should do so [???] since he was
ever a father of [???] my sister . hear then all my guests [???] fair folk of many
realms [???] such as have never before been gathered in this hall ! [???] [???]

steward of [???] [???] and prince of [???] [???] asks that [???] lady of [???]
should be his wife [???] and she grants it full willing . therefore they shall be
[???] before you all . '
and [???] and [???] stood forth and set hand in hand ; and all there
drank to them and were glad . ' thus [???] ' said jomer [???] ' is the friendship of the
mark and of [???] bound with a new bond [???] and the more do i rejoice . '
' no niggard are you [???] jomer [???] ' said [???] [???] ' to give thus to [???] the
fairest thing in your realm ! '
then [???] looked in the eyes of [???] [???] and she said : ' wish me joy [???]
my liege - lord and healer ! '
and he answered : ' i have wished thee joy ever since first i saw thee .
it heals my heart to see thee now in bliss . '
when the feast was over [???] those who were to go took leave of king jomer .
[???] and his knights [???] and the people of [???] and of [???] [???] made
ready to ride ; but [???] and [???] remained at [???] ; and [???]
[???] remained also [???] and she said farewell to her brethren . none saw her
last meeting with [???] her father [???] for they went up into the hills and
there spoke long together [???] and bitter was their parting that should endure
beyond the ends of the world .
at the last before the guests set oat jomer and [???] came to merry [???]
and they said : ' farewell now [???] [???] of the shire and [???] of the
mark ! ride to good fortune [???] and ride back soon to our welcome ! '
and jomer said : ' kings of old would have laden you with gifts that a
wain could not bear for your deeds upon the fields of [???] ; and yet you
will take naught [???] you say [???] but the arms that were given to you . this i
suffer [???] for indeed i have no gift that is worthy ; but my sister begs you to
receive this small thing [???] as a memorial of [???] and of the horns of the
mark at the coming of the morning . '
then [???] gave to merry an ancient horn [???] small but cunningly wrought
all of fair silver with a baldric of green ; and [???] had [???] upon it
swift horsemen riding in a line that wound about it from the tip to the
mouth ; and there were set runes of great virtue .
' this is an [???] of our house [???] ' said [???] . ' it was made by the
[???] [???] and came from the hoard of [???] the worm . [???] the young
brought
it from the north . he that blows it at need shall set fear in the hearts of
his enemies and joy in the hearts of his friends [???] and they shall hear him

and come to him . '
then merry took the horn [???] for it could not be refused [???] and he kissed
[???] ' s hand ; and they embraced him [???] and so they parted for that time .
now the guests were ready [???] and they drank the stirrup - cup [???] and with
great praise and friendship they departed [???] and came at length to helm ' s
deep [???] and there they rested two days . then legolas repaid his promise to
[???] and went with him to the glittering caves ; and when they returned he
was silent [???] and would say only that [???] alone could find fit words to
speak of them . ' and never before has a dwarf claimed a victory over an elf
in a contest of words [???] ' said he . ' now therefore let us go to fangorn and set
the score right ! '
from deeping - coomb they rode to [???] [???] and saw how the ents had
busied themselves . all the stone - circle had been thrown down and removed [???]
and the land within was made into a garden filled with orchards and trees [???]
and a stream ran through it ; but in the midst of all there was a lake of
clear water [???] and out of it the tower of orthanc rose still [???] tall and
[???] [???] and its black rock was mirrored in the pool .
for a while the travellers sat where once the old gates of [???] had
stood [???] and there were now two tall trees like [???] a t the beginning of
a green - bordered path that ran towards orthanc ; and they looked in wonder at
the work that had been done [???] but no living thing could they see far or near .
but presently they heard a voice calling hoom - hom [???] hoom - hom ; and there
came
[???] striding down the path to greet them with [???] at his side .
' welcome to the [???] of orthanc ! ' he said . ' i knew that you were
coming [???] but i was at work up the valley ; there is much still to be done . but
you have not been idle either away in the south and the east [???] i hear ; and
all that i hear is good [???] very good . ' then [???] praised all their deeds [???]
of which he seemed to have full knowledge ; and at last he stopped and looked
long at [???] .
' well [???] come now ! ' he said . ' you have proved mightiest [???] and all your
labours have gone well . where now would you be going ? and why do you
come
here ? '
' to see how your work goes [???] my friend [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and to thank you
for your aid in all that has been achieved . '
' hoom [???] well [???] that is fair enough [???] ' said [???] ; ' for to be sure ents

have played their part . and not only in dealing with that [???] hoom [???] that
accursed tree - slayer that dwelt here . for there was a great [???] of those [???]
[???] [???] those [???] - [???] - [???] - [???] -
[???] - [???] - [???] [???] [???] - [???] [???] hoom [???]
well [???] since you are hasty folk and their full name is as long as years of
torment [???] those vermin of [???] ; and they came over the river a nd down from
the north and all round the wood of [???] [???] which they could not
get into [???] thanks to the great ones who are here . ' he bowed to the lord and
lady of [???] .
' and these same foul creatures were more than surprised to meet us out
on the wold [???] for they had not heard of us before ; though that might be said
also of better folk . and not many will remember us [???] for not many escaped us
alive [???] and the river had most of those . but it was well for you [???] for if they
had not met us [???] then the king of the grassland would not have ridden far [???]
and if he had there would have been no home to return to . '
' we know it well [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and never shall it be forgotten in
minas [???] or in [???] . '
' never is too long a word even for me [???] ' said [???] . ' not while your
kingdoms last [???] you mean ; but they will have to last long indeed to seem long
to ents . '
' the new age begins [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and in this age it may well prove
that the kingdoms of men shall [???] you [???] fangor n my friend . but now come
tell me : what of the task that i set you ? how is [???] ? is he not weary of
orthanc yet ? for i do not suppose that he will think you have improved the
view from his windows . '
[???] gave [???] a long look [???] a most cunning look [???] merry thought .
' ah ! ' he said . ' i thought you would come to that . weary of orthanc ? very
weary at last ; but not so weary of his tower as he was weary of my voice .
hoom ! i gave him some long tales [???] or at least what might be thought long in
your speech . '
' then why did he stay to listen ? did you go into orthanc ? ' asked
[???] .
' hoom [???] no [???] not into orthanc ! ' said [???] . ' but he came to his
window and listened [???] because he could not get news in any other way [???] and
though he hated the news [???] he was greedy to have it ; and i saw that he heard
it all . but i added a great many things to the news that it was good for him
to think of . he grew very weary . he always was hasty . that was his ruin . '

' l observe [???] my good fangorn [???] ' said [???] [???] ' that with great care you
say dwelt [???] was [???] grew . what about is ? is he dead ? '
' no [???] not dead [???] so far as i know [???] ' said [???] . ' but he is gone . yes [???]
he is gone seven days . i let him go . there was little left of him when he
[???] ed out [???] and as for that worm - creature of his [???] he was like a pale
shadow . now do not tell me [???] [???] [???] that i promised to keep him safe ; for i
know it . but things have changed since then . and i kept him until he was
safe [???] safe from doing any mor e harm . you should know that above all i hate
the caging of live things [???] and i will not keep even such creatures as these
caged beyond great need . a snake without fangs may [???] where he will . '
' you may be right [???] ' said [???] ; ' but this snake had still one tooth
left [???] i think . he had the poison of his voice [???] and i guess that he persuaded
you [???] even you [???] [???] knowing the soft spot in your heart . well [???] he is
gone [???] and there is no more to be said . but the tower of orthanc now goes
back to the king [???] to whom it belongs . though maybe he will not need it . '
' that will be seen later [???] ' said [???] . ' but i will give to ents all
this valley to do with as they will [???] so long as they keep a watch upon
orthanc and see that none enter it without my leave . '
' it is locked [???] ' said [???] . ' i made [???] lock it and give me the
keys . [???] has them . '
[???] bowed like a tree bending in the wind and handed to [???]
two great black keys of [???] shape [???] joined by a ring of steel . ' now i
thank you once more [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and i bid you farewell . may your forest
grow again in peace . when this valley is filled there is room and to spare
west of the mountains [???] where once you walked long ago . '
[???] ' s face became sad . ' forests may grow [???] ' he said . ' woods may
spread . but not ents . there are no entings . '
' yet maybe there is now more hope in your search [???] ' said [???] . ' lands
will lie open to you eastward that have long been closed . '
but [???] shook his head and said : ' it is far to go . and there are
too many men there in these days . but i am forgetting my manners ! will you
stay here and rest a while ? and maybe there are some that would be pleased
to pass through fangorn forest and so shorten their road home ? ' he looked at
[???] and [???] .
but all save legolas said that they must now take their leave and
depart [???] either south or west . ' come [???] [???] ! ' said legolas . ' now by fangorn ' s
leave i will visit the deep places of the [???] and see such trees as are

nowhere else to be found in middle - earth . you shall come with me and keep
your word ; and thus we will journey on together to our own lands in [???]
and beyond . ' to this [???] agreed [???] though with no great delight [???] it seemed .
' here then at last comes the ending of the fellowship of the ring [???] '
said [???] . ' yet i hope that ere long you will return to my land with the
help that you promised . '
' we will come [???] if our own lords allow it [???] ' said [???] . ' well [???] farewell .
my [???] ! you should come safe to your own homes now [???] and i shall not be
kept awake for fear of your peril . we will send word when we may [???] and some
of us may yet meet at times ; but i fear that we shall not all be gathered
together ever again . '
then [???] said farewell to each of them in turn [???] and he bowed
three times slowly and with great reverence to [???] and [???] . ' it
is long [???] long since we met by stock or by stone [???] a [???] [???] [???]
[???] ! ' he said . ' it is sad that we should meet only thus at the ending .
for the world is changing : i feel it in the water [???] i feel it in the earth [???]
and i smell it in the air . i do not think we shall meet again . '
and [???] said : ' i do not know [???] eldest . ' but [???] sa id : ' not in
middle - earth [???] nor until the lands that lie under the wave are lifted up
again . then in the willow - meads of [???] we may meet in the spring .
farewell ! '
last of all merry and [???] said good - bye to the old ent [???] and he grew
gayer as he looked at them . ' well [???] my merry folk [???] ' he said [???] ' will you drink
another draught with me before you go ? '
' indeed we will [???] ' they said [???] and he took them aside into the shade of
one of the trees [???] and there they saw that a great stone jar had been set .
and [???] filled three bowls [???] and they drank ; and they saw his strange
eyes looking at them over the rim of his bowl . ' take care take care ! ' he
said . ' for you have already grown since i saw you last . ' and they laughed
and drained their bowls .
' well [???] good - bye ! ' he said . ' and don ' t forget that if you hear any news
of the [???] in your land [???] you will send word to me . ' then he waved his
great hands to all the company and went off into the trees .

the travellers now rode with more speed [???] and they made their way
towards the gap of [???] ; and [???] took leave of them at last close to
that very place where [???] had looked into the stone of orthanc . the

[???] were grieved at this parting ; for [???] had never failed them and
he had been their guide through many perils .
' i wish we could have a stone that we could see all our friends in [???] '
said [???] [???] ' and that we could speak to them from far away ! '
' only one now remains that you could use [???] ' answered [???] for you
would not wish to see what the stone of minas [???] would show you . but the
[???] of orthanc the king will keep [???] to see what is passing in his realm [???]
and what his servants are doing . for do not forget [???] [???] took [???] that you
are a knight of [???] [???] and i do not release you from your service . you are
going now on leave [???] but i may recall you . and remember [???] dear friends of the
shire [???] that my realm lies also in the north [???] and i shall come there one
day . '
then [???] took leave of [???] and [???] ; and the lady said to
him : ' [???] [???] through darkness you have come to your hope [???] and have now
all your desire . use well the days ! '
but [???] said : ' kinsman [???] farewell ! may your doom be other than
mine [???] and your treasure remain with you to the end ! '
with that they parted [???] and it was then the time of sunset ; and when
after a while they turned and looked back [???] they saw the king of the west
sitting upon his horse with his knights about him ; and the falling sun shone
upon them and made all their harness to gleam like red gold [???] and the white
mantle of [???] was turned to a flame . then [???] took the green stone
and held it up [???] and there came a green fire from his hand .
soon the [???] company [???] following the isen [???] turned west and rode
through the gap into the waste lands beyond [???] and then they turned
northwards [???] and passed over the borders of dunland . the [???] fled and
hid themselves [???] for they were afraid of elv ish folk [???] though few indeed ever
came to their country ; but the travellers did not heed them [???] for they were
still a great company and were well provided with all that they needed ; and
they went on their way at their leisure [???] setting up their tents when they
would .
on the sixth day since their parting from the king they journeyed
through a wood climbing down from the hills at the feet of the misty
mountains that now marched on their right hand . as they came out again into
the open country at sundown they overtook an old man leaning on a staff [???] and
he was clothed in rags of grey or dirty white [???] and at his heels went another
beggar [???] slouching and whining .

' well [???] ! ' said [???] . ' where are you going ? '
' what is that to you ? ' he answered . ' will you still order my goings [???]
and are you not content with my ruin ? '
' you know the answers [???] ' said [???] : ' no and no . but in any case the
time of my labours now draws to an end . the king has taken on the burden . if
you had waited at orthanc [???] you would have seen him [???] and he would have
shown
you wisdom and mercy . '
' then all the a more reason to have left sooner [???] ' said [???] ; ' for i
desire neither of him . indeed if you wish for an answer to your first
question [???] i am seeking a way out of his realm . '
' then once more you are going the wrong way [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and i see
no hope in your journey . but will you scorn our help ? for we offer it to
you . '
' to me ? ' said [???] . ' nay [???] pray do not smile at me ! i prefer your
frowns . and as for the lady here [???] i do not trust her : she always hated me [???]
and [???] for your part . i do not doubt that she has brought you this way
to have the pleasure of gloating over my poverty . had i been warned of your
pursuit [???] i would have denied you the pleasure . '
' [???] [???] ' said [???] [???] ' we have other errands and other cares that
seem to us more urgent than hunting for you . say rather that you are
overtaken by good fortune ; for now you have a last chance . '
' if it be truly the last [???] i am glad [???] ' said [???] ; ' for i shall be
spared the trouble of refusing it again . all my hopes are ruined [???] but i
would not share yours . if you have any . '
for a moment his eyes kindled . ' go ! ' he said . ' i did not spend long
study on these matters for naught . you have doomed yourselves [???] and you
know
it . and it will afford me some comfort as i wander to think that you pulled
down your own house when you destroyed mine . and now [???] what ship will
bear
you back across so wide a sea ? ' he mocked . ' it will be a grey ship [???] and full
of ghosts . ' he laughed [???] but his voice was cracked and hideous .
' get up [???] you idiot ! ' he shouted to the other beggar [???] who had sat down
on the ground ; and he struck him with his staff . ' turn about ! if these fine
folk are going our way [???] then we will take another . get on [???] or i ' ll give you
no crust for your supper ! '

the beggar turned and slouched past [???] : ' poor old [???] ! poor
old [???] ! always beaten and cursed . how i hate him ! i wish i could leave
him ! '
' then leave him ! ' said [???] .
but [???] only shot a glance of his bleared eyes full of terror at
[???] [???] and then shuffled quickly past behind [???] . as the wretched pair
passed by the company they came to the [???] [???] and [???] stopped and
stared at them ; but they looked at him with pity .
' so you have come to gloat too [???] have you [???] my [???] ? ' he said . ' you
don ' t care what a beggar lacks [???] do you ? for you have all you want [???] food and
fine clothes [???] and the best weed for your pipes . oh yes [???] i know ! i know where
it comes from . you would not give a pipeful to a beggar [???] would you ? '
' i would [???] if i had any [???] ' said [???] .
' you can have what i have got left [???] ' said merry [???] ' if you will wa it a
moment . ' he got down and searched in the bag at his saddle . then he handed
to [???] a leather pouch . ' take what there is [???] ' he said . ' you are welcome
to it ; it came from the [???] of [???] . '
' mine [???] mine [???] yes and dearly bought ! ' cried [???] [???] clutching at the
pouch . ' this is only a [???] in token ; for you took more [???] i ' ll be bound .
still [???] a beggar must be grateful [???] if a thief returns him even a morsel of
his own . well [???] it will serve you right when you come home [???] if you find
things less good in the [???] than you would like . long may your
land be short of leaf ! '
' thank you ! ' said merry . ' in that case i will have my pouch back [???] which
is not yours and has journeyed far with me . wrap the weed in a rag of your
own . '
' one thief deserves another [???] ' said [???] [???] and turned his back on
merry [???] and kicked [???] [???] and went away towards the wood .
' well [???] i like that ! ' said [???] . ' thief indeed ! what of our claim for
[???] [???] wounding [???] and orc - dragging us through [???] ? '
' ah ! ' said sam . ' and bought he said . how [???] i wonder ? and i didn ' t like
the sound of what he said about the [???] . it ' s time we got back . '
' i ' m sure it is [???] ' said [???] . ' but we can ' t go any quicker [???] if we are
to see [???] . i am going to [???] first [???] whatever happens . '
' yes [???] i think you had better do that [???] ' said [???] . ' but alas for
[???] ! i fear nothing more can be made of him . he has withered altogether .
all the same [???] i am not sure that [???] rd is right : i fancy he could do

some mischief still in a small mean way . '
next day they went on into northern dunland [???] where no men now dwelt [???]
though it was a green and pleasant country . [???] came in with golden
days and silver nights [???] and they rode at ease until they reached the
[???] river [???] and found the old ford [???] east of the falls where it went
down suddenly into the [???] . far to the west in a haze lay the meres and
eyots through which it wound its way to the [???] : there countless swans
housed in a land of reeds .
so they passed into [???] [???] and at last a fair morning [???] [???]
[???] above gleaming mists ; and looking from their camp on a low hill
the travellers saw away in the east the sun catching three peaks that thrust
up into the sky through floating clouds : [???] [???] [???] [???] and [???] .
they were near to the gates of moria .
here now for seven days they tarried [???] for the time was at hand for
another parting which they were loth to make . soon [???] and [???]
and their folk would turn eastward [???] and so pass by the [???] gate and down
the [???] stair to the [???] and to their own country . they had
journeyed thus far by the west - ways [???] for they had much to speak of with
[???] and with [???] [???] and here they lingered still in converse with their
friends . often long after the [???] were wrapped in sleep they would sit
together under the stars [???] recalling the ages that were gone and all their
joys a nd labours in the world [???] or holding council [???] concerning the days to
come . if any wanderer had chanced to pass [???] little would he have seen or
heard [???] and it would have seemed to him only that he saw grey figures [???] carved
in stone [???] [???] of forgotten things now lost in [???] lands . for
they did not move or speak with mouth [???] looking from mind to mind ; and only
their shining eyes stirred and kindled as their thoughts went to and fro .
but at length all was said [???] and they parted again for a while [???] until it
was time for the three rings to pass away . quickly fading into the stones
and the shadows the grey - cloaked people of [???] rode towards the
mountains ; and those who were going to [???] sat on the hill and
watched [???] until there came out of the gathering mist a flash ; and then they
saw no more . [???] knew that [???] had held aloft her ring in token of
farewell .
sam turned away and sighed : ' i wish i was going back to [???] ! '
at last one evening they came over the high moors [???] suddenly as to
travellers it always seemed [???] to the brink of the deep valley of [???]

and saw far below the lamps shining in [???] ' s house . and they went down
and crossed the bridge and came to the doors [???] and all the house was filled
with light and song for joy at [???] ' s [???] .
first of all [???] before they had eaten or washed or even shed their
cloaks [???] the [???] went in search of [???] . they found him all alone in his
little room . it was littered with papers and pens and pencils ; but [???] was
sitting in a chair before a small bright fire . he looked very old [???] but
peaceful [???] and sleepy .
he opened his eyes and looked up as they came in . ' hullo [???] hullo ! ' he
said . ' so you ' ve come back ? and tomorrow ' s my birthday [???] too . how clever of
you ! do you know [???] i shall be one hundred and twenty - nine ? and in one year
more [???] if i am spared [???] i shall equal the old took . i should like to beat him ;
but we shall see . '
after the celebration of [???] ' s birthday the four [???] stayed in
[???] for some days [???] and they sat much with their old friend [???] who spent
most of his time now in his room [???] except at meals . for these he was still
very [???] as a rule [???] and he seldom failed to wake up in t ime for them .
sitting round the fire they told him in turn all that they could remember of
their journeys and adventures . at first he pretended to take some notes ; but
he often fell asleep ; and when he woke he would say : ' how [???] ! how
wonderful ! but where were we ? ' then they went on with the story from the
point where he had begun to nod .
the only part that seemed really to rouse him and hold his attention
was the account of the crowning and marriage of [???] . ' i was invited to
the wedding of course [???] ' he said . ' and i have waited for it long enough . but
somehow [???] when it came to it [???] i found i had so much to do here ; and packing
is such a bother . '
when nearly a fortnight had passed [???] looked out of his window and
saw that there had been a frost in the night [???] and the cobwebs were like
white nets . then suddenly he knew that he must go [???] and say good - bye to
[???] . the weather was still calm and fair [???] after one of the most lovely
summers that people could remember ; but [???] had come [???] and it must
break
soon and begin to rain and blow again . and there was still a very long way
to go . yet it was not really the thought of the weather that stirred him . he
had a feeling that it was time he went back to the shire . sam shared it .
only the night before he had said :

' well [???] mr . [???] [???] we ' ve been far and seen a deal [???] and yet i don ' t think
we ' ve found a better place than this . there ' s something of everything here [???]
if you understand me : the shire and the golden wood and [???] and kings '
houses and inns and [???] and mountains all mixed . and yet [???] somehow [???]
i
feel we ought to be going soon . i ' m worried about my [???] [???] to tell you the
truth . '
' yes [???] something of everything [???] sam [???] except the sea [???] ' [???] had
answered ; and he repeated it now to himself : ' except the sea . '
that day [???] spoke to [???] [???] and it was agreed that they should
leave the next morning . to their delight [???] said : ' i think i shall come
too . at least as far as bree . i want to see [???] . '
in the evening they went to say good - bye to [???] . ' well [???] if you must
go [???] you must [???] ' he said . ' i am sorry . i shall miss you . it is nice just to
know that you are about the place . but i am getting very sleepy . ' then he
gave [???] his [???] - coat and sting [???] forgetting that he had already done
so ; and he gave him also three books of lore that he had made at various
times [???] written in his spidery hand [???] and [???] on their red backs :
translations from the elvish [???] by b . b .
to sam he gave a little bag of gold . ' almost the last drop of the [???]
[???] [???] ' he said . ' may come in useful [???] if you think of getting married [???]
sam . ' sam blushed .
' i have nothing much to give to you young fellows [???] ' he said to merry
and [???] [???] ' except good advice . ' and when he had given them a fair [???]
of this [???] he added a last item in shire - fashion : ' don ' t let your heads get
too big for your hats ! but if you don ' t finish growing up soon [???] you are
going to find hats and clothes expensive . '
' but if you want to beat the old took [???] ' said [???] [???] ' i don ' t see why
we shouldn ' t try and beat the [???] . '
[???] laughed [???] and he produced out of a pocket two beautiful pipes with
pearl mouth - pieces and bound with fine - wrought silver . ' think of me when you
smoke them ! ' he said . ' the elves made them for me [???] but i don ' t smoke now . '
and then suddenly he nodded and went to sleep for a little ; and when he woke
up again he said : ' now where were we ? yes [???] of course [???] g iving presents . which
reminds me : what ' s become of my ring [???] [???] [???] that you took away ? '
' i have lost it [???] [???] dear [???] ' said [???] . ' i got rid of it [???] you know . '
' what a pity ! ' said [???] . ' i should have liked to see it again . but

no [???] how silly of me ! that ' s what you went for [???] wasn ' t it : to get rid of it ?
but it is all so [???] [???] for such a lot of other things seem to have got
mixed up with it : [???] ' s affairs [???] and the white council and [???] [???] and
the horsemen [???] and southrons [???] and [???] - did you really see one [???] sam ? -
and caves and towers and golden trees [???] and goodness knows what besides .
' i evidently came back by much too straight a road from my trip . i
think [???] might have shown me round a bit . but then the auction would
have been over before i got back [???] and i should have had even more trouble
than i did . anyway it ' s too late now ; and really i think it ' s much more
comfortable to sit here and hear about it all . the fire ' s very cosy here [???]
and the food ' s very good [???] and there are elves when you want them . what more
could one want ?
the road goes ever on and on
out from the door where it began .
now far ahead the road has gone [???]
let others follow it who can !
let them a journey new begin [???]
but i at last with weary feet
will turn towards the lighted inn [???]
my evening - rest and sleep to meet . '
and as [???] murmured the last words his head dropped on his chest and
he slept soundly .
the evening deepened in the room [???] and the firelight burned brighter ;
and they looked at [???] as he slept and saw that his face was smiling . for
some time they sat in silence ; and then sam looking round at the room and
the shadows [???] on the walls [???] said softly :
' i don ' t think [???] mr . [???] [???] that he ' s done much writing while we ' ve been
away . he won ' t ever write our story now . '
at that [???] opened an eye [???] almost as if he had heard . then he roused
himself . ' you see [???] i am getting so sleepy [???] ' he said . ' and when i have time
to write [???] i only really like writing poetry . i wonder [???] [???] my dear fellow [???]
if you would very much mind tidying things up a bit before you go ? collect
all my notes and papers [???] and my diary too [???] and take them with you [???] if you
will . you see [???] i haven ' t much time for the selection and the arrangement and
all that . get sam to help [???] and when you ' ve knocked things into shape [???] come
back [???] and i ' ll run over it . i won ' t be too [???] . '
' of course i ' ll do it ! ' said [???] . ' and of course i ' ll come back soon :

it won ' t be dangerous any more . there is a real king now and he will soon
put the roads in order . '
' thank you [???] my dear fellow ! ' said [???] . ' that really is a very great
relief to my mind . ' and with that he fell fast asleep again .
the next day [???] and the [???] took leave of [???] in his room [???]
for it was cold out of doors ; and then they said farewell to [???] and all
his household .
as [???] stood upon the [???] [???] [???] wished him a fair journey [???]
and blessed him [???] and he said :
' i think [???] [???] [???] that maybe you will not need to come back [???] unless you
come very soon . for about this time of the year [???] when the leaves are gold
before they fall [???] look for [???] in the woods of the shire . i shall be with
him . '
these wor ds no one else heard [???] and [???] kept them to himself .




chapter 7 . homeward bound



at last the [???] had their faces turned towards home . they were
eager now to see the shire again ; but at first they rode only slowly [???] for
[???] had been il l at ease . when they came to the ford of [???] [???] he had
halted [???] and seemed loth to ride into the stream ; and they noted that for a
while his eyes appeared not to see them or things about him . all that day he
was silent . it was the sixth of [???] .
' are you in pain [???] [???] ? ' said [???] quietly as he rode by [???] ' s
side .
' well [???] yes i am [???] ' said [???] . ' it is my shoulder . the wound aches [???] and
the memory of darkness is heavy on me . it was a year ago today . '
' alas ! there are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured [???] ' said
[???] .
' i fear it may be so with mine [???] ' said [???] . ' there is no real going
back . though i may come to the shire [???] it will not seem the same ; for i shall
not be the same . i am wounded with knife [???] sting [???] and tooth [???] and a long
burden . where shall i find rest ? '
[???] did not answer .
by the end of the next day the pain and unease had passed [???] and [???]
was merry again [???] as merry as if he did not remember the blackness of the day
before . after that the journey went well [???] and the days went quickly by ; for
they rode at leisure [???] and often they lingered in the fair [???] where
the leaves were red and yellow in the autumn sun . at length they came to
[???] ; and it was then drawing towards evening and the shadow of the
hill lay dark on the road . then [???] begged them to hasten [???] and he would
not look towards the hill [???] but rode through its shadow with head bowed and
cloak drawn close about him . that night the weather changed [???] and a wind came
from the west laden with rain [???] and it blew loud and chill [???] and the yellow
leaves whirled like birds in the air . when they came to the [???] already
the boughs were almost bare [???] and a great curtain of rain veiled bree hill
from their sight .
so it was that near the end of a wild and wet evening in the last days
of [???] the five travellers rode up the climbing road and came to the
south - gate of bree . it was locked fast ; and the rain blew in their faces [???]

and in the darkening sky low clouds went hurrying by [???] and their hearts sank
a little [???] for they had expected more welcome .
when they had called many times [???] at last the gate - keeper came out [???] and
they saw that he carried a great cudgel . he looked at them with fear and
suspicion ; but when he saw that [???] was there [???] and that his companions
were [???] [???] in spite of their strange gear [???] then he brightened and wished
them welcome .
' come in ! ' he said [???] unlocking the gate . ' we won ' t stay for news out
here in the cold and the wet [???] a ruffianly evening . but old barley will no
doubt give you a welcome at the pony [???] and there you ' ll hear all there is to
hear . '
' and there you ' ll hear later all that we say [???] and more [???] ' laughed
[???] . ' how is harry ? '
the gate - keeper [???] . ' gone [???] ' he said . ' but you ' d best ask [???] .
good evening ! '
' good evening to you ! ' they said [???] and passed through ; and then they
noticed that behind the hedge at the road - side a long low hut had been
built [???] and a number of men had come out and were staring at them over the
fence . when they came to bill ferny ' s house they saw that the hedge there
was [???] and unkempt [???] and the windows were all boarded up .
' do you think you killed him with that apple [???] sam ? ' said [???] .
' i ' m not so hopeful [???] mr . [???] [???] ' said sam . ' but i ' d like to know what
became of that poor pony . he ' s been on my mind many a time and the wolves
howling and all . '
at last they came to the prancing pony [???] and that at least looked
outwardly unchanged ; and there were lights behind the red curtains in the
lower windows . they rang the bell [???] and nob came to the door [???] and opened it a
crack and peeped through ; and when he saw them standing under the lamp he
gave a cr y of surprise .
' mr . [???] ! master ! ' he shouted . ' they ' ve come back ! '
' oh have they ? i ' ll learn them [???] ' came [???] ' s voice [???] and out he
came with a rush [???] and he had a club in his hand . but when he saw who they
were he stopped short [???] a nd the black [???] on his face changed to wonder and
delight .
' nob [???] you woolly - pated ninny ! ' he cried . ' can ' t you give old friends
their names ? you shouldn ' t go scaring me like that [???] with times as they are .

well [???] well ! and where have you come from ? i never expected to see any of
you
folk again [???] and that ' s a fact : going off into the wild with that strider [???]
and all those black men about . but i ' m right glad to see you [???] and none more
than [???] . come in ! come in ! the same rooms as - before ? they ' re free .
indeed most rooms are empty these days [???] as i ' ll not hide from you [???] for
you ' ll find it out soon enough . and i ' ll see what can be done about supper [???]
as soon as may be ; but i ' m short - handed at present . hey [???] nob you [???] !
tell bob ! ah [???] but there i ' m forgetting [???] bob ' s gone : goes home to his folk at
nightfall now . well [???] take the guests ' [???] to the stables [???] nob ! and you ' ll
be taking your horse to his stable yourself [???] ; i don ' t doubt . a fine
beast [???] as i said when i first set eyes on him . well [???] come in ! make
yourselves at home ! '
mr . [???] had at any rate not changed his manner of talking [???] and
still seemed to live in his old breathless bustle . and yet there was hardly
anybody about [???] and all was quiet ; from the common room there came a
low
murmur of no more than two or three voices . and seen closer in the light of
two candles that he lit and carried before them the landlord ' s face looked
rather wrinkled and [???] .
he led them down the passage to the parlour that they had used on that
strange night more than a year ago ; and they followed him [???] a little
[???] [???] for it seemed plain to them that old [???] was putting a
brave face on some trouble . things were not what they had been . but they
said nothing [???] and waited .
as they expected mr . [???] came to the parlour after supper to see
if all had been to their liking . as indeed it had : no change for the worse
had yet come upon the beer or the [???] at the pony at any rate . ' now i
won ' t make so bold as to suggest you should come to the common room
tonight [???] ' said [???] . ' you ' ll be tired ; and there isn ' t many folk there
this evening [???] anyway . but if you could spare me half an hour before you go
to your beds [???] i would dearly like to have some talk with you [???] quiet - like by
ourselves . '
' that is just what we should like [???] too [???] ' said [???] . ' we are not
tired . we have been taking things easy . we were wet [???] cold and hungry [???] but
all that you have cured . come [???] sit down ! and if you have any pipe - weed [???]
we ' ll bless you . '

' well [???] if you ' d called for anything else [???] i ' d have been happier [???] ' said
[???] . ' that ' s just a thing that we ' re short of [???] seeing how we ' ve only
got what we grow ourselves [???] and that ' s not enough . there ' s none to be had
from the shire these days . but i ' ll do what i can . '
when he came back he brought them enough to last them for a day or two [???]
a wad of uncut leaf . ' [???] [???] ' he said [???] ' and the best we have ; but not
the match of [???] [???] as i ' ve always said though i ' m all for bree in
most matters [???] begging your pardon . '
they put him in a large chair by the wood - fire [???] and [???] sat on the
other side of the hearth [???] and the [???] in low chairs between them ; and
then they talked for many times half an hour [???] and exchanged all such news as
mr . [???] wished to hear or give . most of the things which they had to
tell were a mere wonder and [???] to their host [???] and far beyond his
vision ; and they brought forth few comments other than : ' you don ' t say ;
often repeated in defiance of the evidence of mr . [???] ' s own ears . ' you
don ' t say [???] mr . [???] [???] or is it mr . [???] ? i ' m getting so mixed up . you
don ' t say [???] master [???] ! well i never ! who ' d have thought it in our
times ! '
but he did say much on his own account . things were far from well [???] he
would say . business was not even fair [???] it was downright bad . ' no one comes
nigh bree now from outside [???] ' he said . ' and the inside folks [???] they stay at
home mostly and keep their doors barred . it all comes of those [???] and
[???] that began coming up the greenway last year [???] as you may remember ;
but more came later . some were just poor bodies running away from trouble ;
but most were bad men [???] full o ' thievery and mischief . and there was trouble
right here in bree [???] bad trouble . why [???] we had a real set - to [???] and there were
some folk killed [???] killed dead ! if you ' ll believe me . '
' i will indeed [???] ' said [???] . ' how many ? '
' three and two [???] ' said [???] [???] referring to the big folk and the
little . ' there was poor mat [???] [???] and rowlie [???] [???] and little
tom [???] from over the hill ; and willie banks from up - away [???] and one of
the [???] from [???] : all good fellows [???] and they ' re missed . and harry
[???] that used to be on the west - gate [???] and that bill ferny [???] they came in
on the strangers ' side [???] and they ' ve gone off with them ; and it ' s my belief
they let them in . on the night of the fight [???] i mean . and that was after we
showed them the gates and pushed them out : before the year ' s end [???] that was ;
and the fight was early in the new year [???] after the heavy snow we had .

' and now they ' re gone for robbers and live outside [???] hiding in the woods
beyond archet [???] and out in the wilds north - away . it ' s like a bit of the bad
old times tales tell of [???] i say . it isn ' t safe on the road and nobody goes
far [???] and folk lock up early . we have to keep watchers all round the fence
and put a lot of men on the gates at nights . '
' well [???] no one troubled us [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and we came along slowly [???] and
kept no watch . we thought we ' d left all trouble behind us . '
' ah [???] that you haven ' t [???] master [???] more ' s the pity [???] ' said [???] . ' but
it ' s no wonder they left you a lone . they wouldn ' t go for armed folk [???] with
swords and helmets and shields and all . make them think twice [???] that would .
and i must say it put me aback a bit when i saw you . '
then the [???] suddenly realized that people had looked at them with
amazement not out of surprise at their return so much as in wonder at their
gear . they themselves had become so used to [???] and to riding in
well - arrayed companies that they had quite forgotten that the bright mail
peeping from under their cloaks [???] and the helms of [???] and the mark [???] and
the fair devices on their shields [???] would seem [???] in their own
country . and [???] [???] too [???] was now riding on his tall grey horse [???] all clad
in white with a great mantle of blue and silver over all [???] and the long sword
[???] at his side .
[???] laughed . ' well [???] well [???] ' he said [???] ' if they are afraid of just
five of us [???] then we have met worse enemies on our travels . but at any rate
they will give you peace at night while we stay . '
' how long will that be ? ' said [???] . ' i ' ll not deny we should be
glad to have you about for a bit . you see [???] we ' re not used to such troubles ;
and the rangers have all gone away [???] folk tell me . i don ' t think we ' ve
rightly understood till now what they did for us . for there ' s been worse
than robbers about . wolves were howling round the fences last winter . and
there ' s dark shapes in the woods [???] dreadful things that it makes the blood
run cold to think of . it ' s been very disturbing [???] if you understand me . '
' i expect it has [???] ' said [???] . ' nearly all lands have been disturbed
these days [???] very disturbed . but cheer up [???] [???] ! you have been on the
edge of very great troubles [???] and i am only glad to hear that you have not
been deeper in . but better times are coming . maybe [???] better than any you
remember . the rangers have returned . we came back with them . and there is
a
king again [???] [???] . he will soon be turning his mind this way .

' then the greenway will be opened again [???] and his messengers will come
north [???] and there will be comings and goings [???] and the evil things will be
driven out of the waste - lands . indeed the waste in time will be waste no
longer [???] and there will be people and fields where once ther e was
wilderness . '
mr . [???] shook his head . ' if there ' s a few decent respectable folk
on the roads [???] that won ' t do no harm [???] ' he said . ' but we don ' t want no more
rabble and ruffians . and we don ' t want no [???] at bree [???] nor near bree
at all . we want to be let alone . i don ' t want a whole crowd o ' strangers
camping here and settling there and tearing up the wild country . '
' you will be let alone [???] [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' there is room enough
for realms between isen and [???] [???] or along the shore lands south of the
[???] [???] without any one living within many days ' ride of bree . and many
folk used to dwell away north [???] a hundred miles or more from here [???] at the far
end of the greenway : on the north downs or by lake [???] . '
' up away by deadmen ' s dike ? ' said [???] [???] looking even more [???] .
' that ' s haunted land [???] they say . none but a robber would go there . '
' the rangers go there [???] ' said [???] . ' deadmen ' s dike [???] you say . so it
has been called for long years ; but its right name [???] [???] [???] is [???]
erain [???] norbury of the kings . and the king will come there again one day ; and
then you ' ll have some fair folk riding through . '
' well [???] that sounds more hopeful [???] i ' ll allow [???] ' said [???] . ' and it
will be good for business [???] no doubt . so long as he lets bree alone . '
' he will [???] ' said [???] . ' he knows it and loves it . '
' does he now ? ' said [???] looking puzzled . ' though i ' m sure i don ' t
know why he should [???] sitting in his big chair up in his great castle [???]
hundreds of miles away . and drinking wine out of a golden cup [???] i shouldn ' t
wonder . what ' s the pony to him [???] or mugs o ' beer ? not but what my beer ' s
good [???] [???] . it ' s been [???] good [???] since you came in the autumn of last
year and put a good word on it . and that ' s been a comfort in trouble [???] i will
say . '
' ah ! ' said sam . ' but he says your beer is always good . '
' he says ? '
' of course he does . he ' s strider . the chief of the rangers . haven ' t you
got that into your head yet ? '
it went in at last [???] and [???] ' s face was a study in wonder . the
eyes in his broad face grew round [???] and his mouth opened wide [???] and he gasped .

' strider ! ' he exclaimed when he got back his breath . ' him with a crown and
all and a golden cup ! well [???] what are we coming to ? '
' better times [???] for bree at any rate [???] ' said [???] .
' i hope so [???] i ' m sure [???] ' said [???] . ' well [???] this has been the nicest
chat i ' ve had in a month of mondays . and i ' ll not deny that i ' ll sleep
easier tonight and with a lighter heart . you ' ve given me a powerful lot to
think over [???] but i ' ll put that off until tomorrow . i ' m for bed [???] and i ' ve no
doubt you ' ll be glad of your beds too . hey [???] nob ! ' he called [???] going to the
door . ' nob [???] you [???] ! '
' now ! ' he said to himself [???] slapping his forehead . ' now what does that
remind me of ? '
' not another letter you ' ve forgotten . i hope [???] mr . [???] ? ' said
merry .
' now [???] now [???] mr . [???] [???] don ' t go reminding me of that ! but there [???]
you ' ve broken my thought . now where was i ? nob [???] stables [???] ah ! that was it .
i ' ve something that belongs to you . if you [???] bill ferny and the
[???] : his pony as you bought [???] well [???] it ' s here . come back all of
itself [???] it did . but where it had been to you know better than me . it was as
[???] as an old dog and as lean as a clothes - rail [???] but it was alive . nob ' s
looked after it . '
' what ! my bill ? ' cried sam . ' well [???] i was born lucky [???] whatever my [???]
may say . there ' s another wish come true ! where is he ? ' sam would not go to
bed until he had visited bill in his stable .
the travellers stayed in bree all the next day [???] and mr . [???] could
not complain of his business next evening at any rate . curiosity overcame
all fears [???] and his house was crowded . for a while out of politeness the
[???] visited the common room in the evening and answered a good
many
questions . bree memories being [???] [???] [???] was asked many times if he
had written his book .
' not yet [???] ' he answered . ' i am going home now to put my notes in order . '
he promised to deal with the amazing events at bree [???] and so give a bit of
interest to a book that appeared likely to treat mostly of the remote and
less important affairs ' away south ' .
then one of the younger folk called for a song . but at that a hush
fell [???] and he was frowned down [???] and the call was not repeated . evidently
there was no wish for any uncanny events in the common room again .

no trouble by day [???] nor any sound by night [???] disturbed the peace of bree
while the travellers remained there ; but the next morning they got up early [???]
for as the weather was still rainy they wished to reach the shire before
night [???] and it was a long ride . the bree folk were all out to see them off [???]
and were in merrier mood than they had been for a year ; and those who had
not seen the strangers in all their gear before gaped with wonder at them :
at [???] with his white beard [???] and the light that seemed to gleam from
him [???] as if his blue mantle was on ly a cloud over sunshine ; and at the four
[???] like riders upon [???] out of almost forgotten tales . even those
who had laughed at all the talk about the king began to think there might be
some truth in it .
' well [???] good luck on your road [???] and good luck to your home - coming ! said
mr . [???] . ' i should have warned you before that all ' s not well in the
shire neither [???] if what we hear is true . funny goings on [???] they say . but one
thing drives out another [???] and i was full of my own troubles . but i f i may be
so bold [???] you ' ve come back changed from your travels [???] and you look now like
folk as can deal with troubles out of hand . i don ' t doubt you ' ll soon set
all to rights . good luck to you ! and the oftener you come back the better
i ' ll be pleased . '
they wished him farewell and rode away [???] and passed through the
west - gate and on towards the shire . bill the pony was with them [???] and as
before he had a good deal of [???] [???] but he trotted along beside sam and
seemed well content .
' i wonder what old [???] was hinting at [???] ' said [???] .
' i can guess some of it [???] ' said sam [???] . ' what i saw in the mirror :
trees cut down and all [???] and my old [???] turned out of the row . i ought to
have hurried back quicker . '
' and something ' s wrong with the [???] evidently [???] ' said merry .
' there ' s a general shortage of pipe - weed . '
' whatever it is [???] ' said [???] [???] ' [???] will be at the bottom of it : you
can be sure of that . '
' deep in [???] but not at the bottom [???] ' said [???] . ' you have forgotten
[???] . he began to take an interest in the shire before [???] did . '
' well [???] we ' ve got you with us [???] ' said merry [???] ' so things will soon be
cleared up . '
' i am with you at present [???] ' said [???] [???] ' but soon i shall not be . i
am not coming to the shire . you must settle its affairs yourselves ; that is

what you have been trained for . do you not yet understand ? my time is over :
it is no longer my task to set things to rights [???] nor to help folk to do so .
and as for you [???] my dear friends [???] you will need no help . you are grown up
now . grown indeed very high ; among the great you are [???] and i have no longer
any fear at all for any of you .
' but if you would know [???] i am turning aside soon . i am going to have a
long talk with [???] : such a talk as i have not had in all my time . he is
a moss - gatherer [???] and i have been a stone doomed to rolling . but my rolling
days are ending [???] and now we shall have much to say to one another . '
in a little while they came to the point on the east road where they
had taken leave of [???] ; and they hoped and half expected to see him
standing there to greet them as they went by . but there was no sign of him ;
and there was a grey mist on the barrow - downs southwards [???] and a deep veil
over the old forest far away .
they halted and [???] looked south [???] . ' i should dearly like to
see the old fellow again [???] ' he said . ' i wonder how he is getting on ? '
' as well as ever [???] you may be sure [???] ' said [???] . ' quite [???] and
i should guess [???] not much interested in anything that we have done or seen [???]
unless perhaps in our visits to the ents . there may be a time later for you
to go and see him . but if i were you [???] i should press on now for home [???] or you
will not come to the [???] bridge before the gates are locked . '
' but there aren ' t any gates [???] ' said merry [???] ' not on the road ; you know
that quite well . there ' s the buckland gate [???] of course ; but they ' ll let me
through that at any time . '
' there weren ' t any gates [???] you mean [???] ' said [???] . ' i think you will
find some now . and you might have more trouble even at the buckland gate
than you think . but you ' ll ! manage all right . good - bye dear friends ! not for
the last time [???] not yet . good - bye ! '
he turned [???] off the road [???] and the great horse leaped the green
dike that here ran beside it ; and then at a cry from [???] he was gone [???]
racing towards the barrow - downs like a wind from the north .
' well here we are [???] just the four of us that started out together [???] ' said
merry . ' we have left all the rest behind [???] one after another . it seems almost
like a dream that has slowly faded . '
' not to me [???] ' said [???] . ' to me it feels more like falling asleep
again . '




chapter 8 . the scouring of the shire



it was after nightfall when [???] wet and tired [???] the travellers came at last
to the [???] [???] and they found the way barred . at either end of the
bridge there was a great [???] gate ; and on the further side of the river
they could see that some new houses had been built : two - [???] with narrow
straight - sided windows [???] bare and dimly lit [???] all very gloomy and
un - [???] .
they hammered on the outer gate and called [???] but there was at first no
answer ; and then to their surprise someone blew a horn [???] and the lights in
the windows went out . a voice shouted in the dark :
' who ' s that ? be off ! you can ' t come in : can ' t you read the notice : no
admittance between sundown and [???] ? '
' of course we can ' t read the notice in the dark . ' sam shouted back .
' and if [???] of the shire are to be kept out in the wet on a night like
this [???] i ' ll tear down your notice when i find it . '
at that a window [???] [???] and a crowd of [???] with lanterns poured
out of the house on the left . they opened the further gate [???] and some came
over the bridge . when they saw the travellers they seemed frightened .
' come along ! ' said merry [???] recognizing one of the [???] . ' if you don ' t
know me [???] hob hayward [???] you ought to . i am merry [???] [???] and i should
like
to know what all this is about [???] and what a [???] like you is doing
here . you used to be on the hay gate . '
' bless me ! it ' s master merry [???] to be sure [???] and all dressed up for
fighting ! ' said old hob . ' why [???] they said you was dead ! lost in the old
forest by all accounts . i ' m pleased to see you alive after all ! '
' then stop gaping at me through the bars [???] and open the gate ! ' said
merry .
' i ' m sorry [???] master merry [???] but we have orders . '
' whose orders ? '
' the chief ' s up at bag end . '
' chief ? chief ? do you mean mr . [???] ? ' said [???] .
' i suppose so [???] mr . [???] ; but we have to say just [???] the chief [???]
[???] . '

' do you indeed ! ' said [???] . ' well [???] i am glad he has dropped the
[???] at any rate . but it is evidently high time that the family dealt
with him and put him in his place . '
a hush fell on the [???] beyond the gate . ' it won ' t do no good
talking that way [???] ' said one . ' he ' ll get to hear of it . and if you make so
much noise [???] you ' ll wake the chief ' s big man . '
' we shall wake him up in a way that will surprise him [???] ' said merry . ' if
you mean that your precious chief has been hiring ruffians out of the wild [???]
then we ' ve not come back too soon . ' he sprang from his pony [???] and seeing the
notice in the light of the lanterns [???] he tore it down and threw it over the
gate . the [???] backed away and made no move to open it . ' come on [???]
[???] ! ' said merry . ' two is enough . '
merry and [???] c limbed the gate [???] and the [???] fled . another horn
sounded . out of the bigger house on the right a large heavy figure appeared
against a light in the doorway .
' what ' s all this [???] ' he [???] as he came forward . ' gate - breaking ? you
clear out [???] or i ' l l break your filthy little necks ! ' then he stopped [???] for he
had caught the gleam of swords .
' bill ferny [???] ' said merry [???] ' if you don ' t open that gate in ten seconds [???]
you ' ll regret it . i shall set steel to you [???] if you don ' t obey . and when you
have opened the gates you will go through them and never return . you are a
ruffian and a highway - robber . '
bill ferny flinched and shuffled to the gate and unlocked it . ' give me
the key ! ' said merry . but the ruffian flung it at his head and then darted
out into the darkness . as he passed the [???] one of them let fly with his
heels and just caught him as he ran . he went off with a [???] into the night
and was never heard of again .
' neat work [???] bill [???] ' said sam [???] meaning the pony .
' so much for your big man [???] ' said merry . ' we ' ll see the chief later . in
the meantime we want a lodging for the night [???] and as you seem to have pulled
down the bridge inn and built this dismal place instead [???] you ' ll have to put
us up . '
' i am sorry [???] mr . merry [???] ' said hob [???] ' but it isn ' t allowed . '
' what isn ' t allowed ? '
taking in folk off - hand like and eating extra food [???] and all that [???] said
hob .
' what ' s the matter with the place ? ' said merry . ' has it been a bad

year [???] or what ? i thought it had been a fine summer and harvest . '
' well no [???] the year ' s been good enough [???] ' said hob . ' we grows a lot of
food [???] but we don ' t rightly know what becomes of it . it ' s all these
[???] gatherers [???] and [???] sharers [???] [???] i reckon [???] going round counting and measuring and
taking off to storage . they do more gathering than sharing [???] and we never see
most of the stuff again . '
' oh come ! ' said [???] yawning . ' this is all too tiresome for me
tonight . we ' ve got food in our bags . just give us a room to lie down in .
it ' ll be better than many places i have seen . '
the [???] at the gate still seemed ill at ease [???] evidently some rule
or other was being broken ; but there was no [???] four such masterful
travellers [???] all armed [???] and two of them [???] large and strong - looking .
[???] ordered the gates to be locked again . there was some sense at any rate
in keeping a guard [???] while ruffians were still about . then the four
companions went into the hobbit guard - house and made themselves as
comfortable as they could . it was a bare and ugly place [???] with a mean little
grate that would not allow a good fire . in the upper rooms were little rows
of hard beds [???] and on every wall there was a notice and a list of rules .
[???] tore them down . there was no beer and very little food [???] but with what
the travellers brought and shared out they all made a fair meal ; and [???]
broke rule 4 by putting most of next day ' s allowance of wood on the fire .
' well now [???] what about a smoke [???] while you tell us what has been
happening in the shire ? ' he said .
' there isn ' t no pipe - weed now [???] ' said hob ; ' at least only for the
chief ' s men . all the stocks seem to have gone . we do hear that waggon - loads
of it went away down the old road out of the [???] [???] over sarn ford
way . that would be the end o ' last year [???] after you left . but it had been
going away quietly before that [???] in a small way . that [???] - - '
' now you shut up [???] hob hayward ! ' cried several of the others . ' you know
talk o ' that sor t isn ' t allowed . the chief will hear of it [???] and we ' ll all be
in trouble . '
' he wouldn ' t hear naught [???] if some of you here weren ' t sneaks [???] ' rejoined
hob hotly .
' all right [???] all right ! ' said sam . [???] that ' s quite enough . i don ' t want to
hear no more . no welcome [???] no beer [???] no smoke [???] and a lot of rules and orc - talk
instead . i hoped to have a rest [???] but i can see there ' s work and trouble
ahead . let ' s sleep and forget it till morning ! '

the new ' chief ' evidently had means of getting news . it was a good
forty miles from the bridge to bag end [???] but someone made the journey in a
hurry . so [???] and his friends soon discovered .
they had not made any definite plans [???] but had vaguely thought of going
down to [???] together first [???] and resting there a bit . but now [???] seeing
what things were like [???] they decided to go straight to [???] . so the next
day they set out along the road and jogged along steadily . the wind had
dropped but the sky was grey . the land looked rather sad and forlorn ; bu t it
was after all the first of [???] and the fag - end of autumn . still there
seemed an unusual amount of burning going on [???] and smoke rose from many
points round about . a great cloud of it was going up far away in the
direction of the woody end .
as evening fell they were drawing near to [???] [???] a village right
on the road [???] about twenty - two miles from the bridge . there they meant to
stay the night ; the floating log at [???] was a good inn . but as they
came to the east end of the village they met a barrier with a large board
saying no road ; and behind it stood a large band of [???] with staves in
their hands and feathers in their caps [???] looking both important and rather
scared .
' what ' s all this ? ' said [???] [???] feeling inclined to laugh .
this is what it is [???] mr . [???] [???] said the leader of the [???] [???] a
two - feather hobbit : ' you ' re arrested for gate - breaking [???] and tearing up of
rules [???] and assaulting gate - keepers [???] and trespassing [???] and sleeping in
shire - buildings without leave [???] and bribing guards with food . '
' and what else ? ' said [???] .
' that ' ll do to go on with [???] ' said the [???] - leader .
' i can add some more [???] if you like it [???] ' said sam . ' calling your chief
names [???] wishing to punch his [???] face [???] and thinking you [???] look a
lot of tom - fools . '
' there now [???] mister [???] that ' ll do . it ' s the chief ' s orders that you ' re to
come along quiet . we ' re going to take you to bywater and hand you over to
the chief ' s men ; and when he deals with your case you can have your say . but
if you don ' t want to stay in the [???] any longer than you need [???] i
should cut the say short [???] if i was you . '
to the [???] of the [???] [???] and his companions all
roared with laughter . ' don ' t be absurd ! ' said [???] . ' i am going where i
please [???] and in my own time . i happen to be going to bag end on business [???] but

if you insist on going too [???] well that is your affair . '
' very well [???] mr . [???] [???] ' said the leader [???] pushing the barrier aside .
' but don ' t forget i ' ve arrested you . '
' i won ' t [???] ' said [???] . ' never . but i may forgive you . now i am not
going any further today [???] so if you ' ll kindly escort me to the floating log [???]
i ' ll be obliged . '
' i can ' t do that [???] mr . [???] . the inn ' s closed . there ' s a
[???] - house at the far end of the village . i ' ll take you there . '
' all right [???] ' said [???] . ' go on and we ' ll follow . '
sam had been looking the [???] up and down and had spotted one that
he knew . ' hey [???] come here robin [???] ! ' he called . ' i want a word with
you . '
with a sheepish glance at his leader [???] who looked wrathful but did not
dare to [???] [???] [???] [???] fell back and walked beside sam [???] who
got down off his pony .
' look here [???] cock - robin ! ' said sam . ' you ' re [???] - bred and ought to
have more sense [???] coming a - [???] mr . [???] and all . and what ' s all this
about the inn being closed ? '
' they ' re all closed [???] ' said robin . ' the chief doesn ' t hold with beer .
leastways that is how it started . but now i reckon it ' s his men that has it
all . and he doesn ' t hold with folk moving about ; so if they will or they
must [???] then they has to go to the [???] - house and explain their business . '
' you ought to be ashamed of yourself having anything to do with such
nonsense [???] ' said sam . ' you used to like the inside of an inn better than the
outside yourself . you were always popping in [???] on duty or off . '
' and so i would be still [???] sam [???] if i could . but don ' t be hard on me .
what can i do ? you know how i went for a [???] seven years ago [???] before
any of this began . gave me a chance of walking round the country and seeing
folk [???] and hearing the news [???] and knowing where the good beer was . but now
it ' s different . '
' but you can give it up [???] stop [???] [???] if it has stopped being a
respectable job [???] ' said sam .
' we ' re not allowed to [???] ' said robin .
' if i hear not allowed much oftener [???] ' said sam [???] ' i ' m going to get
angry . '
' can ' t say as i ' d be sorry to see it [???] ' said robin lowering his voice .
' if we all got angry together something might be done . but it ' s these men [???]

sam [???] the chief ' s men . he sends them round everywhere [???] and if any of us small
folk stand up for our rights [???] they drag him off to the [???] . they took
old [???] [???] old will whitfoot the mayor [???] first [???] and they ' ve taken a
lot more . lately it ' s been getting worse . often they beat ' em now . '
' then why do you do their work far them ? ' said sam angrily . ' who sent
you to [???] ? '
' no one did . we stay here in the big [???] - house . we ' re the first
[???] troop now . there ' s hundreds of [???] all told and they want
more [???] with all these new rules . most of them are in it against their will [???]
but not all . even in the shire there are some as like minding other folk ' s
business and talking big . and there ' s worse than that : there ' s a few as do
spy - work for the chief and his men . '
' ah ! so that ' s how you had news of us [???] is it ? '
' that ' s right . we aren ' t allowed to send by it now [???] but they use the
old quick post service [???] and keep special runners at different points . one
came in from [???] last night with a [???] secret message [???] [???] and another
took it on from here . and a message came back this afternoon saying you was
to be arrested and taken to bywater [???] not direct to the [???] . the chief
wants to see you at once [???] evidently . '
' he won ' t be so eager when mr . [???] has finished with him [???] ' said sam .
the [???] - house at [???] was as bad as the bridge - house . it had
only one storey [???] but it had the same narrow windows [???] and it was built of
ugly pale bricks [???] badly laid . inside it was damp and cheerless [???] and supper
was served on a long bare table that had not been [???] for weeks . the
food deserved no better setting . the travellers were glad to leave the
place . it was about eighteen miles to bywater [???] and they set off at ten
o ' clock in the morning . they would have started earlier [???] only the delay so
plainly annoyed the [???] - leader . the west wind had shifted northward and
it was turning colder [???] but the rain was gone .
it was rather a comic [???] that left the village [???] though the few
folk that came out to stare at the ' get - up ' of the travellers did not seem
quite sure whether laughing was allowed . a dozen [???] had been told off
as escort to the ' prisoners ' ; but merry made them march in front [???] while
[???] and his friends rode behind . merry [???] [???] [???] and sam sat at their ease
laughing and talking and singing [???] while the [???] [???] along trying
to look stern and important . [???] [???] however [???] was silent and looked rather
sad and thoughtful .

the last person they passed was a [???] old [???] clipping a hedge .
' hullo [???] hu llo ! ' he jeered . ' now who ' s arrested who ? '
two of the [???] immediately left the party and went towards him .
' leader ! ' said merry . ' order your fellows back to their places at once [???] if
you don ' t want me to deal with them ! '
the two [???] at a sharp word from the leader came back [???] . ' now
get on ! ' said merry [???] and after that the travellers saw to it that their
[???] ' pace was quick enough to push the [???] along as fast as they
could go . the sun came out [???] and in spite of the chilly wind they were soon
puffing and sweating .
at the three - farthing stone they gave it up . they had done nearly
fourteen miles with only one rest at noon . it was now three o ' clock . they
were hungry and very [???] and they could not stand the pace .
' well [???] come along in your own time ! ' said merry . ' we are going on . '
' good - bye [???] cock - robin ! ' said sam . ' i ' ll wait for you outside the green
dragon [???] if you haven ' t forgotten where that is . don ' t [???] on the way ! '
' you ' re br eaking arrest [???] that ' s what you ' re doing [???] ' said the leader
ruefully [???] ' and i can ' t be answerable . '
' we shall break a good many things yet [???] and not ask you to answer '
said [???] . ' good luck to you ! '
the travellers trotted on [???] and as the sun began to sink towards the
white downs far away on the western [???] they came to bywater by its
wide
pool ; and there they had their first really painful shock . this was [???]
and sam ' s own country [???] and they found out now that they cared about it more
than any other place in the world . many of the houses that they had known
were missing . some seemed to have been burned down . the pleasant row of
old
hobbit - holes in the bank on the north side of the pool were deserted [???] and
their little gardens that used to run down bright to the water ' s edge were
rank with weeds . worse [???] there was a whole line of the ugly new houses all
along pool side [???] where the [???] road ran close to the bank . an avenue of
trees had stood there . they were all gone . and looking with dismay up the
road towards bag end they saw a tall chimney of brick in the distance . it
was pouring out black smoke into the evening air .
sam was beside himself . ' i ' m going right on [???] mr . [???] ! ' he cried . ' i ' m
going to see what ' s up . i want to find my [???] . '

' we ought to find out first what we ' re in for [???] sam [???] ' said merry . ' i
guess that the [???] chief [???] will have a gang of ruffians handy . we had better
find someone who will tell us how things are round here . '
but in the village of bywater all the houses and holes were shut [???] and
no one greeted them . they wondered at this [???] but they soon discovered the
reason of it . when they reached the green dragon [???] the last house on the
[???] side [???] now lifeless and with broken windows [???] they were disturbed to
see half a dozen large ill - favoured men [???] against the inn - wall ; they
were squint - eyed and sallow - faced .
' like that friend of bill ferny ' s at bree [???] ' said sam .
' like many that i saw at [???] [???] ' muttered merry .
the ruffians had clubs in their hands and horns by their belts [???] but
they had no other weapons [???] as far as could be seen . as the travellers rode
up they left the wall and walked into the road [???] blocking the way .
' where d ' you think you ' re going ? ' said one [???] the largest and most
evil - looking of the crew . ' there ' s no road for you any further . and where
are those precious [???] ? '
' coming along nicely [???] ' said merry . ' a little [???] [???] perhaps . we
promised to wait for them here . '
' garn [???] what did i say ? ' said the ruffian to his mates . ' i told sharkey
it was no good trusting those little fools . some of our chaps ought to have
been sent . '
' and what difference would that have made [???] pray ? ' said merry . ' we are
not used to [???] in this country [???] but we know how to deal with them . '
' [???] [???] eh ? ' said the man : ' so that ' s your tone [???] is it ? change it [???]
or we ' ll change it for you . you little folk are getting too [???] . don ' t
you trust too much in the boss ' s kind heart . sharkey ' s come now and he ' ll do
what sharkey says . '
' and what may that be ? ' said [???] quietly .
' this country wants waking up and setting to rights [???] ' said the ruffian [???]
' and sharkey ' s going to do it ; and make it hard [???] if you drive him to it . you
need a bigger boss . and you ' ll get one before the year is out [???] if there ' s
any more trouble . then you ' ll learn a thing or two [???] you little rat - folk . '
' indeed . i am glad to hear of your plans [???] ' said [???] . ' i am on my way
to call on mr . [???] [???] and he may be interested to hear of them too . '
the ruffian laughed . ' [???] ! he knows all right . don ' t you worry . he ' ll
do what sharkey says . because if a boss gives trouble [???] we can change him .

see ? and if little folks try to push in where they ' re not wanted [???] we can put
them out of mischief . see ? '
' yes [???] i see [???] ' said [???] . ' for one thing [???] i see that you ' re behind the
times and the news here . much has happened since you left the south . your
day is over [???] and all other ruffians ' . the dark tower has fallen [???] and there
is a king in [???] . and [???] has been destroyed [???] and your precious
master is a beggar in the wilderness . i passed him on the road . the king ' s
messengers will ride up the greenway now not bullies from [???] . '
the man stared at him and smiled . ' a beggar in the wilderness ! ' he
mocked . ' oh [???] is he indeed ? swagger it [???] swagger it [???] my little cock - a - whoop .
but that won ' t stop us living in this fat little country where you have
lazed long enough . and ' - he snapped his fingers in [???] ' s face - ' king ' s
messengers ! that for them ! when i see one [???] i ' ll take notice [???] perhaps . '
this was too much for [???] . his thoughts went back to the field of
[???] [???] and here was a squint - eyed rascal calling the ring - bearer ' little
cock - a - whoop ' . he cast back his cloak [???] flashed out his sword [???] and the silver
and sable of [???] gleamed on him as he rode forward .
' i am a messenger of the king [???] ' he said . ' you are speaking to the
king ' s friend [???] and one of the most renowned in all the lands of the west .
you are a ruffian and a fool . down on your knees in the road and ask pardon [???]
or i will set this troll ' s bane in you ! '
the sword glinted in the westering sun . merry and sam drew their swords
also a nd rode up to support [???] ; but [???] did not move . the ruffians
gave back . scaring breeland peasants [???] and bullying [???] [???] [???] had
been their work . fearless [???] with bright swords and grim faces were a
great surprise . and there was a note in the voices of these [???] that
they had not heard before . it chilled them with fear .
' go ! ' said merry . ' if you trouble this village again [???] you will regret
it . ' the three [???] came on [???] and then the ruffians turned and fled
running away up the [???] road ; but they blew their horns as they ran .
' well [???] we ' ve come back none too soon [???] ' said merry .
' not a day too soon . perhaps too late [???] at any rate to save [???] [???] ' said
[???] . ' miserable fool [???] but i am sorry for him . '
' save [???] ? whatever do you mean ? ' said [???] . ' destroy him i should
say . '
' i don ' t think you quite understand things [???] [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' [???]
never meant things to come to this pass . he has been a wicked fool [???] but he ' s

caught now . the ruffians are on top [???] gathering [???] robbing and bullying [???] and
running or ruining things as they like [???] in his name . and not in his name
even for much longer . he ' s a prisoner in bag end now [???] i expect [???] and very
frightened . we ought to try and rescue him . '
' well i am [???] ! ' said [???] . ' of all the ends to our journey
that is the very last i should have thought of : to have to fight half - [???]
and ruffians in the shire itself - to rescue [???] [???] ! '
' fight ? ' said [???] . ' well [???] i suppose it may come to that . but
remember : there is to be no slaying of [???] [???] not even if they have gone
over to the other side . really gone over [???] i mean ; not just obeying ruffians '
orders because they are frightened . no hobbit has ever killed another on
purpose in the shire [???] and it is not to begin now . and nobody is to be killed
at all [???] if it can be helped . keep your tempers and hold your hands to the
last possible moment ! '
' but if there are many of these ruffians [???] ' said merry [???] ' it will
certainly mean fighting . you won ' t rescue [???] [???] or the shire [???] just by being
shocked and sad [???] my dear [???] . '
' no [???] ' said [???] . ' it won ' t be so easy scaring them a second time .
they were taken by surprise . you heard that horn - blowing ? ev idently there
are other ruffians near at hand . they ' ll be much bolder when there ' s more of
them together . we ought to think of taking cover somewhere for the night .
after all we ' re only four [???] even if we are armed . '
' i ' ve an idea [???] ' said sam . ' let ' s go to old tom cotton ' s down south
lane ! he always was a stout fellow . and he has a lot of lads that were all
friends of mine . '
' no ! ' said merry . ' it ' s no good [???] getting under cover [???] . that is just
what people have been doing [???] and just what these ruffians like . they will
simply come down on us in force [???] corner us [???] and then drive us out [???] or burn
us in . no [???] we have got to do something at once . '
' do what ? ' said [???] .
' raise the shire ! ' said merry . ' now ! wake all our people ! they hate all
this [???] you can see : all of them except perhaps one or two rascals [???] and a few
fools that want to be important [???] but don ' t at all understand what is really
going on . but shire - folk have been so comfortable so long they don ' t know
what to do . they just want a match [???] though [???] and they ' ll go up in fire . the
chief ' s men must know that . they ' ll try to stamp on us and put us out quick .
we ' ve only got a very short time .

' sam [???] you can make a dash for cotton ' s farm [???] if you like . he ' s the
chief person round here [???] and the [???] . come on ! i am going to blow the
horn of [???] [???] and give them all some music they have never heard before . '
they rode back to the middle of the village . there sam turned aside and
[???] off down the lane that led south to cotton ' s . he had not gone far
when he heard a sudden clear horn - call go up ringing into the sky . far over
hill and field it echoed ; and so compelling was that call that sam himself
almost turned and dashed back . his pony reared and neighed .
' on [???] lad ! on ! ' he cried . ' we ' ll be going back soon . '
then he heard merry change the note [???] and up went the horn - cry of
buckland [???] shaking the air .
awake ! awake ! fear [???] fire [???] foes ! awake !
fire [???] foes ! awake !
behind him sam heard a [???] of voices and a great din and [???] of
doors . in front of him lights sprang out in the gloaming ; dogs barked ; feet
came running . before he got to the lane ' s end there was farmer cotton with
three of his lads [???] young tom [???] jolly [???] and nick [???] hurrying towards him . they
had axes in their hands [???] and barred the way .
' nay ! it ' s not one of them ruffians [???] ' sam heard the farmer say . ' it ' s a
hobbit by the size of it [???] but all dressed up queer . hey ! ' he cried . ' who are
you [???] and what ' s all this to - do ? '
' it ' s sam [???] sam [???] . i ' ve come back . '
farmer cotton came up close and stared at him in the [???] . ' well ! '
he exclaimed . ' the voice is right [???] and your face is no worse than it was [???]
sam . but i should a ' passed you in the street in that gear . you ' ve been in
foreign parts [???] seemingly . we feared you were dead . '
' that i ain ' t ! ' said sam . ' nor mr . [???] . he ' s here and his friends .
and that ' s the to - do . they ' re raising the shire . we ' re going to clear out
these ruffians [???] and their chief too . we ' re starting now . '
' good [???] good ! ' cried farmer cotton . ' so it ' s begun at last ! i ' ve been
itching for trouble all this year [???] but folks wouldn ' t help . and i ' ve had the
wife and rosie to think of . these ruffians don ' t stick at nothing . but come
on now [???] lads ! bywater is up ! we must be in it ! '
' what about mrs . cotton and rosie ? ' said sam . ' it isn ' t safe yet for
them to be left all alone . '
' my [???] is with them . but you can go and help him [???] if you have a
mind [???] ' said farmer cotton with a grin . then he and his sons ran off towards

the village .
sam hurried to the house . by the large round door at the top of the
steps from the wide yard stood mrs . cotton and rosie [???] and [???] in front of
them grasping a hay - fork .
' it ' s me ! ' shouted sam as he trotted up . ' sam [???] ! so don ' t try
prodding me [???] [???] . anyway [???] i ' ve a mail - shirt on me . '
he jumped down from his pony and went up the steps . they stared at him
in silence . ' good evening [???] mrs . cotton ! ' he said . ' hullo rosie ! '
' hullo [???] sam ! ' said rosie . ' where ' ve you been i they said you were dead ;
but i ' ve been expecting you since the spring . you haven ' t hurried have you ? '
' perhaps not [???] ' said sam [???] . ' but i ' m hurrying now . we ' re setting
about the ruffians [???] and i ' ve got to get back to mr . [???] . but i thought i ' d
have a look and see how mrs . cotton was keeping [???] and you [???] rosie . '
' we ' re keeping nicely [???] thank you [???] ' said mrs . cotton . ' or should be [???] if
it weren ' t for these thieving ruffians . '
' well [???] be off with you ! ' said rosie . ' if you ' ve been looking after mr .
[???] all this while [???] what d ' you want to leave him for [???] as soon as things
look dangerous ? '
this was too much for sam . it needed a week ' s answer [???] or none . he
turned away and mounted his pony . but as he started off [???] rosie ran down the
steps .
' i think you look fine [???] sam [???] ' she said . ' go on now ! but take care of
yourself [???] and come straight back as soon as you have settled the ruffians ! '
when sam got back he found the whole village roused . already [???] apart
from many younger lads [???] more than a hundred [???] [???] were assembled
with axes [???] and heavy hammers [???] and long knives [???] and stout staves : and a few
had hunting - bows . more were still coming in from [???] farms .
some of the village - folk had lit a large fire [???] just to enliven things [???]
and also because it was one of the things forbidden by the chief . it burned
bright as night came on . others at merry ' s orders were setting up [???]
across the road at each end of the village . when the [???] came up to
the lower one they were [???] ; but as soon as they saw how things
were [???] most of them took off their feathers and joined in the revolt . the
others slunk away .
sam found [???] and his friends by the fire talking to old tom cotton [???]
while an admiring crowd of bywater folk stood round and stared .
' well [???] what ' s the next move ? ' said farmer cotton .

' i can ' t say [???] ' said [???] [???] ' until i know more . how many of these
ruffians are there ? '
' that ' s hard to tell [???] ' said cotton . ' they moves about and comes and
goes . there ' s sometimes fifty of them in their sheds up [???] way ; but
they go out from there roving round [???] thieving or [???] gathering [???] as they call
it . still there ' s seldom less than a score round the boss [???] as they names
him . he ' s at bag end [???] or was ; but he don ' t go outside the rounds now . no one
s seen him at all [???] in fact [???] for a week or two ; but the men don ' t let no one
go near . '
' [???] ' s not their only place [???] is it ? ' said [???] .
' no [???] more ' s the pity [???] ' said cotton . ' there ' s a good few down south in
[???] and by sarn ford [???] i hear ; and some more lurking in the woody
end ;
and they ' ve sheds at [???] . and then there ' s the [???] [???] as they call
' em : the old storage - [???] at michel delving that they ' ve made into
prisons for those as stand up to them . still i reckon there ' s not above
three hundred of them in the shire all told [???] and maybe less . we can master
them [???] if we stick together . '
' have they got any weapons ? ' asked merry .
' whips [???] knives [???] and clubs [???] enough for their dirty work : that ' s all
they ' ve showed so far [???] ' said cotton . ' but i dare say they ' ve got other gear [???]
if it comes to fighting . some have bows [???] [???] y . they ' ve shot one or two of
our folk . '
' there you are [???] [???] ! ' said merry . ' i knew we should have to fight .
well [???] they started the killing . '
' not exactly [???] ' said cotton . ' leastways not the shooting . tooks started
that . you see our dad mr . [???] [???] he ' s never had no truck with this [???] [???]
not from the beginning : said that if anyone was going to play the chief at
this time of day [???] it would be the right thain of the shire and no [???] .
and when [???] sent his men they got no change out of him . tooks are lucky [???]
they ' ve got those deep holes in the green hills [???] the great [???] and all [???]
and the ruffians can ' t come at ' em ; and they won ' t let the ruffians come on
their land . if they do [???] tooks hunt ' em . tooks shot three for [???] and
robbing . after that the ruffians turned [???] . and they keep a pretty
close watch on tookland . no one gets in nor out of it now . '
' good for the tooks ! ' cried [???] . ' but someone is going to get in
again [???] now . i am off to the [???] . anyone coming with me to [???] ? '

[???] rode off with half a dozen lads on [???] . ' see you soon ! ' he
cried . ' it ' s only fourteen miles or so over the fields . i ' ll bring you back
an army of tooks in the morning . ' merry blew a horn - call after them as they
rode off into the gathering night . the people cheered .
' all the same [???] ' said [???] to all those who stood near [???] ' i wish for no
killing ; not even of the ruffians [???] unless it must be done [???] to prevent them
from hurting [???] . '
' all right ! ' said merry . ' but we shall be having a visit from the
[???] gang any time now [???] i think . they won ' t come just to talk things
over . we ' ll try to deal with them neatly [???] but we must be prepared for the
worst . now i ' ve got a plan . '
' very good [???] ' said [???] . ' you make the arrangements . '
just then some [???] [???] who had been sent out towards [???] [???] came
running in . ' they ' re coming ! ' they said . ' a score or more . but two have gone
off west across country . '
' to [???] [???] that ' ll be [???] ' said cotton [???] ' to fetch more of the gang .
well [???] it ' s fifteen mile each way . we needn ' t trouble about them just yet . '
merry hurried off to give orders . farmer cotton cleared the street [???]
sending everyone [???] [???] except the older [???] who had weapons of some
sort . they had not long to wait . soon they could hear loud voices [???] and then
the tramping of heavy feet . presently a whole squad of the ruffians came
down the road . they saw the barrier and laughed . they did not imagine that
ther e was anything in this little land that would stand up to twenty of
their kind together .
the [???] opened the barrier and stood aside . ' thank you ! ' the men
jeered . ' now run home to bed before you ' re whipped . ' then they marched along
the street shouting : ' put those lights out ! get [???] and stay there ! or
we ' ll take fifty of you to the [???] for a year . get in ! the boss is
losing his temper . '
no one paid any heed to their orders ; but as the ruffians passed [???] they
closed in qu [???] behind and followed them . when the men reached the fire
there was farmer cotton standing all alone warming his hands .
' who are you [???] and what d ' you think you ' re doing ? ' said the
ruffian - leader .
farmer cotton looked at him slowly . ' i was just going to ask you that [???] '
he said . ' this isn ' t your country [???] and you ' re not wanted . '
' well [???] you ' re wanted anyhow [???] ' said the leader . ' we want you . take him

lads ! [???] for him [???] and give him something to keep him quiet ! '
the men took one step forward and stopped short . there rose a roar of
voices all round them [???] and suddenly they were aware that farmer cotton was
not all alone . they were surrounded . in the dark on the edge of the
firelight stood a ring of [???] that had crept up out of the shadows .
there was nearly two hundred of them [???] all holding some weapon .
merry stepped forward . ' we have met before [???] ' he said to the leader [???]
' and i warned you not to come back here . i warn you again : you are standing
in the light and you are covered by archers . if you lay a finger on this
farmer [???] or on anyone else [???] you will be shot at once . lay down any weapons
that you have ! '
the leader looked round . he was trapped . but he was not scared [???] not now
with a score of his fellows to back him . he knew too little of [???] to
understand his peril . foolishly he decided to fight . it would be easy to
break out .
' at ' em lads ! ' he cried . ' let ' em have it ! '
with a long knife in his left hand and a club in the other he made a
rush at the ring [???] trying to burst out back towards [???] . he aimed a
savage blow at merry who stood in his way . he fell dead with four arrows in
him :
that was enough for the others . they gave in . their weapons were taken
from them [???] and they were roped together [???] and marched off to an empty hut
that they had built themselves [???] and there they were tied hand and foot [???] and
locked up under guard . the dead leader was dragged off and buried .
' seems almost too easy after all [???] don ' t it ? ' said cotton . ' i said we
could master them . but we needed a call . you came back in the nick o ' time [???]
mr . merry . '
' there ' s more to be done still [???] ' said merry . ' if you ' re right in your
reckoning [???] we haven ' t dealt with a tithe of them yet . but it ' s dark now . i
think the next stroke must wait until morning . then we must call on the
chief . '
' why not now ? ' said sam . ' it ' s not much more than six o ' clock . and i
want to see my [???] . d ' you know what ' s come of him [???] mr . cotton ? '
' he ' s not too well [???] and not too bad [???] sam [???] ' said the farmer . ' they dug
up [???] row [???] and that was a sad blow to him . he ' s in one of them new
houses that the chief ' s men used to build while they still did any work
other than burning and thieving : not above a mile from the end of bywater .

but he comes around to me [???] when he gets a chance [???] and i see he ' s better fed
than some of the poor bodies . all against the rules [???] of course . i ' d have had
him with me [???] but that wasn ' t allowed . '
' thank ' ee indeed [???] mr . cotton [???] and i ' ll never forget it [???] ' said sam . ' but
i want to see him . that boss and that sharkey [???] as they spoke of [???] they might
do a mischief up there before the morning . '
' all right [???] sam [???] ' said cotton . ' choose a lad or two [???] and go and fetch
him to my house . you ' ll not have need to go near the old [???] village
over water . my jolly here will show you . '
sam went off . merry arranged for look - outs round the village and guards
at the [???] during the night . then he and [???] went off with farmer
cotton . they sat with the family in the warm kitchen [???] and the cottons asked
a few polite questions about their travels [???] but hardly listened to the
answers : they were far more concerned with events in the shire .
' it all began with [???] [???] as we call him [???] ' said farmer cotton ; ' and it
began as soon as you ' d gone off [???] mr . [???] . he ' d funny ideas had [???] .
seems he wanted to own everything himself [???] and then order other folk about .
it soon came out that he already did own a sight more than was good for him ;
and he was always [???] more [???] though where he got the money was a
mystery : mills and malt - houses and inns [???] and farms [???] and leaf - plantations .
he ' d already bought sandyman ' s mill before he came to bag end [???] seemingly .
' of course he started with a lot of property in the [???] which
he had from his dad ; and it seems he ' d been selling a lot o ' the best leaf [???]
and sending it away quietly for a year or two . but at the end o ' last year
he began sending away loads of stuff [???] not only leaf . things began to get
short [???] and winter coming on [???] too . folk got angry [???] but he had his answer . a
lot of men [???] ruffians mostly [???] came with great waggons [???] some to carry off the
goods south - away [???] and others to stay . and more came . and before we knew
where we were they were planted here and there all over the shire [???] and were
felling trees and digging and building themselves sheds and houses just as
they liked . at first goods and damage was paid for by [???] ; but soon they
began lording it around and taking what they wanted .
' then there was a bit of trouble [???] but not enough . old will the mayor
set off for bag end to protest [???] but he never got there . ruffians laid hands
on him and took and locked him up in a hole in michel delving [???] and there he
is now . and after that [???] it would bc soon after new year [???] there wasn ' t no
more mayor [???] and [???] called himself chief [???] [???] or just chief [???] and did

as he liked ; and if anyone got [???] [???] [???] as they called it [???] they followed
will . so things went from bad to worse . there wasn ' t no smoke left [???] save for
the men ; and the chief didn ' t hold with beer [???] save for his men [???] and closed
all the inns ; and everything except rules got shorter and shorter [???] unless
one could hide a bit of one ' s own when the ruffians went round gathering
stuff up [???] for fair distribution [???] : which meant they got it and we didn ' t [???]
except for the leavings which you could have at the [???] - houses [???] if you
could stomach them . all very bad . but since sharkey came it ' s been plain
ruination . '
' who is this sharkey ? ' said merry . ' i heard one of the ruffians speak
of him . '
' the [???] ruffian o ' the lot [???] seemingly [???] ' answered cotton . ' it was
about last harvest [???] end o ' [???] maybe [???] that we first heard of him .
we ' ve never seen him [???] but he ' s up at bag end ; and he ' s the real chief now [???] i
guess . all the ruffians do what he says ; and what he says is mostly hack [???]
burn [???] and ruin ; and now it s come to killing . there s no longer even any bad
sense in it . they cut down trees and let ' em lie [???] they burn houses and build
no more .
' take sandyman ' s mill now . [???] knocked it down almost as soon as he
came to bag end . then he brought in a lot o ' dirty - looking men to build a
bigger one and fill it full o ' wheels and [???] [???] . only that
fool ted was pleased by that [???] and he works there cleaning wheels for the
men [???] where his dad was the miller and his own master . [???] ' s idea was to
grind more and faster [???] or so he said . he ' s got other mills like it . but
you ' ve got to have grist before you can grind ; and there was no more for the
new mill to do than for the old . but since sharkey came they don ' t grind no
more corn at all . they ' re always a - hammering and a - letting out a smoke and a
stench [???] and there isn ' t no peace even at night in [???] . and they pour
out filth a purpose ; they ' ve fouled all the lower water and it ' s getting
down into [???] . if they want to make the shire into a desert [???] they ' re
going the right way about it . i don ' t believe that fool of a [???] ' s behind
all this . it ' s sharkey [???] i say . '
' that ' s right ! ' put in young tom . ' why [???] they even took [???] ' s old ma [???]
that [???] [???] and he was fond of her [???] if no one else was . some of the
[???] folk [???] they saw it . she comes down the lane with her old [???] .
some of the ruffians were going up with a big cart .
' [???] where be you a - going ? [???] says she .

' [???] to bag end [???] [???] says they .
' [???] what for ? [???] says she .
' [???] to put up some sheds for sharkey [???] [???] says they .
' [???] who said you could ? [???] says she .
' [???] sharkey [???] [???] says they . [???] so get out o ' the road [???] old [???] ! [???]
' [???] i ' ll give you sharkey [???] you dirty thieving ruffians ! [???] says she [???] and
ups with her [???] and goes for the leader . near twice her size . so they
took her . dragged her off to the [???] [???] at her age too . they ' ve took
others we miss more [???] but there ' s no denying she showed more spirit than
most . '
into the middle of this talk came sam [???] bursting in with his [???] . old
[???] did not look much older [???] but he was a little deafer .
' good evening . mr . [???] ! ' he said . ' glad indeed i am to see you safe
back . but i ' ve a bone to pick with you [???] in a manner o ' speaking [???] if i may
make so bold . you didn ' t never ought to have a ' sold bag end [???] as i always
said . that ' s what started all the mischief . and while you ' re been [???]
in foreign parts [???] chasing black men up mountains from what my sam says [???]
though what for he don ' t make clear [???] they ' ve been and dug up [???] row and
ruined my taters ! '
' i am very sorry [???] mr . [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' but now i ' ve come back [???]
i ' ll do my best to make amends . '
' well [???] you can ' t say fairer than that [???] ' said the [???] . ' mr . [???]
[???] is a real [???] [???] i always have said [???] whatever you may think
of some others of the name [???] begging your pardon . and i hope my sam ' s
behaved
hisself and given satisfaction ? '
' perfect satisfaction [???] mr . [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' indeed [???] if you will
believe it [???] he ' s now one of the most famous people in all the lands [???] and
they are making songs about his deeds from here to the sea and beyond the
great river . ' sam blushed [???] but he looked gratefully at [???] [???] for rosie ' s
eyes were shining and she was smiling at him .
' it takes a lot o ' believing [???] ' said the [???] [???] ' though i can see he ' s
been mixing in strange company . what ' s come of his [???] ? i don ' t hold with
wearing [???] [???] whether it wears well or no . '
farmer cotton ' s household and all his guests were up early next
morning . nothing had been heard in the night [???] but more trouble would
certainly come before the day was old . ' seems as if none o ' the ruffians

were left up at bag end [???] ' said cotton ; ' but the gang from [???] will be
along any time now . '
after breakfast a messenger from the tookland rode in . he was in high
spirits . ' the thain has raised all our country [???] ' he said [???] ' and the news is
going like fire all ways . the ruffians that were watching our land have fled
off south [???] those that escaped alive . the thain has gone after them [???] to hold
off the big gang down that way ; but he ' s sent mr [???] back with all the
other folk he can spare . '
the next news was less good . merry [???] who had been out all night [???] came
riding in about ten o ' clock . ' there ' s a big band about four miles away [???] ' he
said . ' they ' re coming along the road from [???] [???] but a good many stray
ruffians have joined up with them . there must be close on a hundred of them ;
and they ' re fire - raising as they come . curse them ! '
' ah ! this lot won ' t stay to talk [???] they ' ll kill [???] if they can [???] ' said
farmer cotton . ' if tooks don ' t come sooner [???] we ' d best get behind cover and
shoot without [???] . there ' s got to be some fighting before this is
settled [???] mr . [???] . '
the tooks did come sooner . before long they marched in [???] a hundred
strong [???] from [???] and the green hills with [???] at their head .
merry now had enough [???] [???] to deal with the ruffians . scouts
reported that they were keeping close together . they knew that the
countryside had risen against them [???] and plainly meant to deal with the
rebellion [???] [???] at its centre in bywater . but however grim they [???] might
be [???] they seemed to have no leader among them who understood [???] .
they
came on without any [???] . merry laid his plans quickly .
the ruffians came tramping along the east road [???] and without halting
turned up the bywater road [???] which ran for some way [???] up between
high
banks with low hedges on top . round a bend [???] about a furlong from the main
road [???] they met a stout barrier of old farm - carts [???] . that halted them .
at the same moment they became aware that the hedges on both sides [???] just
above their heads [???] were all lined with [???] . behind them other [???]
now pushed out some more waggons that had been hidden in a field [???] and so
blocked the way back . a voice spoke to them from above .
' well [???] you have walked into a trap [???] ' said merry . ' your fellows from
[???] did the same [???] and one is dead and the rest are prisoners . lay down

your weapons ! then go back twenty paces and sit down . any who try to
break
out will be shot . '
but the ruffians could not now be cowed so easily . a few of them
obeyed [???] but were immediately set on by their fellows . a score or more broke
back and charged the waggons . six were shot [???] but the remainder burst out [???]
killing two [???] [???] and then scattering across country in the direction of
the woody end . two more fell as they ran . merry blew a loud horn - call [???] and
there were answering calls from a distance .
' they won ' t get far [???] ' said [???] . ' all that country is alive with our
hunters now . '
behind [???] the trapped men in the lane [???] still about four score [???] tried to
climb the barrier and the banks [???] and the [???] were obliged to shoot many
of them or hew them with axes . but many of the strongest and most desperate
got out on the west side [???] and attacked their enemies fiercely [???] being now
more bent on killing than escaping . several [???] fell [???] and the rest were
wavering [???] when merry and [???] [???] who were on the east side [???] came across and
charged the ruffians . merry himself slew the leader [???] a great squint - eyed
brute like a huge orc . then he drew his forces off [???] [???] the last
[???] of the men in a wide ring of archers .
at last all was over . nearly seventy of the ruffians lay dead on the
field [???] and a dozen were prisoners . nineteen [???] were killed [???] a nd some
thirty were wounded . the dead ruffians were laden on waggons and hauled off
to an old sand - pit nearby and there buried : in the battle pit [???] as it was
afterwards called . the fallen [???] were laid together in a grave on the
hill - side [???] wher e later a great stone was set up with a garden about it . so
ended the battle of bywater [???] [???] [???] the last battle fought in the shire [???] and
the only battle since the [???] [???] [???] [???] away up in the [???] .
in consequence [???] though it happily cost very few lives [???] it has a chapter to
itself in the red book [???] and the names of all those who took part were made
into a roll [???] and learned by heart by shire - [???] . the very considerable
rise in the fame and fortune of the cottons dates from this time ; but at the
top of the roll in all accounts stand the names of captains [???] and
[???] .
[???] had been in the battle [???] but he had not drawn sword [???] and his chief
part had been to prevent the [???] in their wrath at their losses [???] from
slaying those of their enemies who threw down their weapons . when the

fighting was over [???] and the later labours were ordered [???] merry [???] [???] [???] and
sam joined him [???] and they rode back with the cottons . they ate a late midday
meal [???] and then [???] said with a sigh : ' well [???] i suppose it is time now that
we dealt with the [???] chief [???] . '
' yes indeed ; the sooner the better [???] ' said merry . ' and don ' t be too
gentle ! he ' s responsible for bringing in these ruffians [???] and for all the
evil they have done . '
farmer cotton collected an escort of some two dozen [???] [???] .
' for it ' s only a guess that there is no ruffians left at bag end [???] ' he said .
' we don ' t know . ' then they set out on foot . [???] [???] sam [???] merry [???] and [???]
led the way .
it was one of the [???] hours in their lives . the great chimney rose
up before them ; and as they drew near the old village across the water [???]
through rows of new mean houses along each side of the road [???] they saw the
new mill in all its frowning and dirty ugliness : a great brick building
[???] the stream [???] which it fouled with a steaming and stinking
[???] . all along the bywater road every tree had been felled .
as they crossed the bridge and looked up the hill they gasped . even
sam ' s vision in the mirror had not prepared him for what they saw . the old
grange on the west side had been knocked down [???] and its place taken by rows
of tarred sheds . all the chestnuts were gone . the banks and hedgerows were
broken . great waggons wer e standing in disorder in a field beaten bare of
grass . [???] row was a yawning sand and gravel quarry . bag end up .
beyond
could not be seen for a clutter of large huts .
' they ' ve cut it down ! ' cried sam . ' they ' ve cut down the party tree ! ' he
pointed to where the tree . had stood under which [???] had made his farewell
speech . it was lying lopped and dead in the field . as if this was the last
straw sam burst into tears .
a laugh put an end to them . there was a surly hobbit [???] over the
low wall of the mill - yard . he was grimy - faced and black - handed . ' don ' t ' ee
like it [???] sam ? ' he sneered . ' but you always was soft . i thought you ' d gone
off in one o ' them ships you used to prattle about [???] sailing [???] sailing . what
d ' you want to come back for ? we ' ve work to do in the shire now . '
' so i see [???] ' said sam . ' no time for washing [???] but time for wall - propping .
but see here [???] master sandyman [???] i ' ve a score to pay in this village [???] and
don ' t you make it any longer with your jeering [???] or you ' ll foot a bill too

big for your purse . '
ted sandyman spat over the wall : ' garn ! ' he said . ' you can ' t touch me .
i ' m a friend o ' the boss ' s . but he ' ll touch you all right [???] if i have any
more of your mouth . '
' don ' t waste any more words on the fool [???] sam ! ' said [???] . ' i hope
there are not many more [???] that have become like this . it would be a
worse trouble than all the damage the men have done . '
' you are dirty and insolent [???] sandyman [???] ' said merry . ' and also very much
out of your reckoning . we are just going up the hill to remove your precious
boss . we have dealt with his men . '
ted gaped [???] for at that moment he first caught sight of the escort that
at a sign from merry now marched over the bridge . dashing back into the mill
he ran out with a horn and blew it loudly .
' save your breath ! ' laughed merry . ' i ' ve a better . ' then lifting up his
silver horn he winded it [???] and its clear call rang over the hill ; and out of
the holes and sheds and [???] houses of [???] the [???] answered [???] and
came pouring out [???] and with cheers and loud cries they followed the company
up the road to bag end .
at the top of the lane the party halted [???] and [???] and his friends went
on ; and they came at last to the once beloved place . the garden wa s full of
huts and sheds [???] some so near the old westward windows that they cut off all
their light . there were piles of refuse everywhere . the door was scarred ;
the bell - chain was dangling loose [???] and the bell would not ring . knocking
brought no answer . at length they pushed and the door yielded . they went in .
the place stank and was full of filth and disorder : it did not appear to
have been used for some time .
' where is that miserable [???] hiding ? ' said merry . they had searched
every room and found no living thing save rats and mice . ' shall we turn on
the others to search the sheds ? '
' this is worse than [???] ! ' said sam . ' much worse in a way . it comes
home to you [???] as they say ; because it is home [???] and you remember it before it
was all ruined . '
' yes [???] this is [???] [???] ' said [???] . ' just one of its works . [???] was
doing its work all the time [???] even when he thought he was working for
himself . and the same with those that [???] tricked [???] like [???] . '
merry looked round in dismay and disgust . ' let ' s get out ! ' he said . ' if
i had known all the mischief he had caused [???] i should have stuffed my pouch

down [???] ' s throat . '
' no doubt [???] no doubt ! but you did not [???] and so i am able to welcome you
home . ' there standing at the door was [???] himself [???] looking well - fed and
well - pleased ; his eyes gleamed with malice and [???] .
a sudden light broke on [???] . ' sharkey ! ' he cried .
[???] laughed . ' so you have heard the name [???] have you ? all my people
used to call me that in [???] [???] i believe . a sign of affection [???] possibly . (
but evidently you did not expect to see me here . '
' i did not [???] ' said [???] . ' but i might have guessed . a little mischief
in a mean way : [???] warned me that you were still capable of it .
' quite capable [???] ' said [???] [???] ' and more than a little . you made me
laugh [???] you hobbit - lordlings [???] riding along with all those great people so
secure and so pleased with your little selves . you thought you had done very
well out of it a ll [???] and could now just amble back and have a nice quiet time
in the country . [???] ' s home could be all wrecked [???] and he could be turned
out [???] but no one could touch yours . oh no ! [???] would look after your
affairs . '
[???] laughed again . ' not he ! when his tools have done their task he
drops them . but you must go dangling after him [???] [???] and talking [???] and
riding round twice as far as you needed . [???] well [???] [???] thought i [???] [???] if they ' re such
fools [???] i will get ahead of them and teach them a lesson . one ill turn
deserves another . [???] it would have been a sharper lesson [???] if only you had
given me a little more time and more men . still i have already done much
that you will find it hard to mend or undo in your lives . and it will be
plea sant to think of that and set it against my injuries . '
' well [???] if that is what you find pleasure in [???] ' said [???] [???] ' i pity you .
it will be a pleasure of memory only [???] i fear . go at once and never return ! '
the [???] of the villages had seen [???] come out of one of the
huts [???] and at once they came crowding up to the door of bag end . when they
heard [???] ' s command [???] they murmured angrily :
' don ' t let him go ! kill him ! he ' s a villain and a murderer . kill him ! '
[???] looked round at their hostile faces and smiled . ' kill him ! ' he
mocked . ' kill him [???] if you think there are enough of you [???] my brave [???] ! '
he drew himself up and stared at them darkly with his black eyes . ' but do
not think that when i lost all my goods i lost all my power ! whoever strikes
me shall be accursed . and if my blood stains the shire [???] it shall wither and
never again be healed . '

the [???] recoiled . but [???] said : ' do not believe him ! he has lost
all power [???] save his voice that can still daunt you and deceive you [???] if you
let it . but i will not have him slain . it is useless to meet revenge with
revenge : it will heal nothing . go [???] [???] [???] by the speediest way ! '
' worm ! worm ! ' [???] called ; and out of a nearby hut came
[???] [???]
[???] [???] almost like a dog . to the road again [???] worm ! ' said [???] . ' these
fine fellows and lordlings are turning us [???] again . come along ! '
[???] turned to go [???] and [???] shuffled after him . but even as
[???] passed close to [???] a knife flashed in his hand [???] and he stabbed
swiftly . the blade turned on the hidden mail - coat and snapped . a dozen
[???] [???] led by sam [???] leaped forward with a cry and flung the villain to the
ground . sam drew his sword .
' no [???] sam ! ' said [???] . ' do not kill him even now . for he has not hurt
me . and in any case i do not wish him to be slain in this evil mood . he was
great once [???] of a noble kind that we should not dare to raise our hands
against . he is fallen [???] and his cure is beyond us ; but i would still spare
him [???] in the hope that he may find it . '
[???] rose to his feet [???] and stared at [???] . there was a strange look
in his eyes of mingled wonder and respect and hatred . ' you have grown [???]
halfling [???] ' he said . ' yes [???] you have grown very much . you are wise [???] and cruel .
you have robbed my revenge of sweetness [???] and now i must go hence in
bitterness [???] in debt to your mercy . i hate it and you ! well [???] i go and i will
trouble you no more . but do not expect me to wish you health and long life .
you will have neither . but that is not my doing . i merely foretell . '
he walked away [???] and the [???] made a lane for him to pass ; but their
[???] whitened as they gripped on their weapons . [???] [???] [???]
and then followed his master .
' [???] ! ' called [???] . ' you need not follow him . i know of no evil
you have done to me . you can have rest and food here for a while [???] until you
are stronger and can go your own ways . '
[???] halted and looked back at him [???] half prepared to stay .
[???] turned . ' no evil ? ' he [???] . ' oh no ! even when he sneaks out at
night it is only to look at the stars . but did i hear someone ask where poor
[???] is hiding ? you know [???] don ' t you [???] worm ? will you tell them ? '
[???] cowered down and [???] : ' no [???] no ! '
' then i will [???] ' said [???] . ' worm killed your chief [???] poor little

fellow [???] your nice little boss . didn ' t you [???] worm ? stabbed him in his sleep [???] i
believe . buried him [???] i hope ; though worm has been very hungry lately . no [???]
worm is not really nice . you had better leave him to me . '
a look of wild hatred came into [???] ' s red eyes . ' you told me to ;
you made me do it [???] ' he [???] .
[???] laughed . ' you do what sharkey says [???] always [???] don ' t you [???] worm ?
well [???] now he says : follow ! ' he kicked [???] in the face as he
grovelled [???] and turned and made off . but at that something snapped : suddenly
[???] rose up [???] drawing a hidden knife [???] and then with a [???] like a dog
he sprang on [???] ' s back [???] jerked his head back [???] cut his throat [???] and with
a yell ran off down the lane . before [???] could recover or speak a word [???]
three hobbit - bows twanged and [???] fell dead .
to the dismay of those that stood by [???] about the body of [???] a grey
mist gathered [???] and rising slowly to a great height like smoke from a fire [???]
as a pale shrouded figure it loomed over the hill . for a moment it wavered [???]
looking to the west ; but out of the west came a cold wind [???] and it bent away [???]
and with a sigh dissolved into nothing .
[???] looked down at the body with pity and horror [???] for as he looked it
seemed that long years of death were suddenly revealed in it [???] and it shrank [???]
and the [???] face became rags of skin upon a hideous skull . lifting up
the skirt of the dirty cloak that [???] beside it [???] he covered it over [???]
and turned away .
' and that ' s the end of that [???] ' said sam . ' a [???] end [???] and i wish i
needn ' t have seen it ; but it ' s a good [???] . '
' and the very last end of the war [???] i hope [???] ' said merry .
' i hope so [???] ' said [???] and sighed . ' the very last stroke . but to think
that it should fall here [???] at the very door of bag end ! among all my hopes
and fears at least i never expected that . '
' i shan ' t call it the end [???] till we ' ve cleared up the mess [???] ' said sam
[???] . ' and that ' ll take a lot of time and work . '




chapter 9 . the grey havens



the clearing up certainly needed a lot of work [???] but it took less time
than sam had feared . the day after the battle [???] rode to michel delving
and released the prisoners from the [???] . one of the first that they
found was poor [???] bolger [???] fatty no longer . he had been taken when the
ruffians smoked out a band of rebels that he led from their hidings up in
the [???] by the hills of scary .
' you would have done better to come with us after all [???] poor old
[???] ! ' said [???] [???] as they carried him out too weak to walk .
he opened an eye and tried gallantly to smile . ' who ' s this young giant
with the loud voice ? ' he whispered . ' not little [???] ! what ' s your size in
hats now ? '
then there was [???] . poor thing [???] she looked very old and thin when
they rescued her from a dark and narrow cell . she insisted on hobbling out
on her own feet ; and she had such a welcome [???] and there was such clapping and
cheering when she appeared [???] leaning on [???] ' s arm but still clutching her
[???] [???] that she was quite touched [???] and drove away in tears . she had never
in her life been popular before . but she was crushed by the news of [???] ' s
murder [???] and she would ' not return to bag end . she gave it back to [???] [???] and
went to her own people [???] the [???] of [???] .
when the poor creature died next spring - she was after all more than a
hundred years old - [???] was surprised and much moved : she had left all
that remained of her money and of [???] ' s for him to use in helping [???]
made homeless by the troubles . so that feud was ended .
old will whitfoot had been in the [???] longer than any [???] and though
he had perhaps been treated less harshly than some [???] he needed a lot of
feeding up before he could look the part of mayor ; so [???] agreed to act as
his deputy [???] until mr . whitfoot was in shape again . the only thing that he
did as deputy mayor was to reduce the [???] to their proper functions
and numbers . the task of hunting out the last [???] of the ruffians was
left to merry and [???] [???] and it was soon done . the southern [???] [???] after
hearing the news of the battle of bywater [???] fled out of the land and offered
little resistance to the thain . before the year ' s end the few [???] were
rounded up in the woods [???] and those that [???] were shown to the

borders .
meanwhile the labour of repair went on apace [???] and sam was kept very
busy . [???] can work like bees when the mood and the need comes on
them .
now there were thousands of willing hands of all ages [???] from the small but
nimble ones of the hobbit lads and lasses to the well - worn and horny ones of
the [???] and [???] . before [???] not a brick was left standing of the
new [???] - houses or of anything that had been built by ' sharkey ' s men ' ;
but the bricks were used to repair many an old hole [???] to make it [???] and
drier . great stores of goods a nd food [???] and beer [???] were found that had been
hidden away by the ruffians in sheds and barns and deserted holes [???] and
especially in the [???] at michel delving and in the old quarries at
scary ; so that there was a great deal better cheer that [???] than anyone had
hoped for .
one of the first things done in [???] [???] before even the removal of
the new mill [???] was the clearing of the hill and bag end [???] and the restoration
of [???] row . the front of the new sand - pit was all levelled and made into
a large sheltered garden [???] and new holes were dug in the southward face [???] back
into the hill [???] and they were lined with brick . the [???] was restored to
number three ; and he said often and did not care who heard it :
' it ' s an ill wind as blows nobody no good [???] as i always say . and all ' s
well as ends better ! '
there was some discussion of the name that the new row should be given .
battle gardens was thought of [???] or better [???] . but after a while in
sensible hobbit - fashion it was just called new row . it was a purely bywater
joke to refer to it as sharkey ' s end .
the trees were the worst loss and damage [???] for at sharkey ' s bidding they
had been cut down [???] far and wide over the shire ; and sam grieved
over this more than anything else . for one thing [???] this hurt would take long
to heal [???] and only his great - [???] [???] he thought [???] would see the shire
as it ought to be .
then suddenly one day [???] for he had been too busy for weeks to give a
thought to his adventures [???] he remembered the gift of [???] . he brought
the box out and showed it to the other travellers ( for so they were now
called by everyone ) [???] and asked their advice .
' i wondered when you would think of it [???] ' said [???] . ' open it ! '
inside it was filled with a grey dust [???] soft and fine [???] in the middle of

which was a seed [???] like a small nut with a silver shale . ' what can i do with
this ? ' said sam .
' throw it in the air on a breezy day and let it do its work ! ' said
[???] .
' on what ? ' said sam .
' choose one spot as a nursery [???] and see what happens to the plants
there [???] ' said merry .
' but i ' m sure the lady would not like me to keep it all for my own
garden [???] now so many folk have suffered [???] ' said sam .
' use all the wi ts and knowledge you have of your own [???] sam [???] ' said [???] [???]
' and then use the gift to help your work and better it . and use it
sparingly . there is not much here [???] and i expect every grain has a value . '
so sam planted saplings in all the places where specially beautiful or
beloved trees had been destroyed [???] and he put a grain of the precious dust in
the soil at the root of each . he went up and down the shire in this labour ;
but if he paid special attention to [???] and bywater no one blamed h im .
and at the end he found that he still had a little of the dust left ; so he
went to the three - farthing stone [???] which is as near the centre of the shire
as no matter [???] and cast it in the air with his blessing . the little silver
nut he planted in the party field where the tree had once been ; and he
wondered what would come of it . all through the winter he remained as
patient as he could [???] and tried to restrain himself from going round
constantly to see if anything was happening .
spring [???] his wildest hopes . his trees began to sprout and grow [???]
as if time was in a hurry and wished to make one year do for twenty . in the
party field a beautiful young sapling leaped up : it had silver bark and long
leaves and burst into golden flowers in april . it was indeed a mallorn [???] and
it was the wonder of the neighbourhood . in after years [???] as it grew in grace
and beauty [???] it was known far and wide and people would come long journeys
to
see it : the only mallorn west of the mountains and east of the sea [???] and one
of the finest in the world .
altogether [???] in the shire was a marvellous year . not only was there
wonderful sunshine and delicious rain [???] in due times and perfect measure [???] but
there seemed something more : an air of richness and growth [???] and a gleam of a
beauty beyond that of mortal summers that [???] and pass upon this
middle - earth . all the children born or begotten in that year [???] and there were

many [???] were fair to see and strong [???] and most of them had a rich golden hair
that had before been rare among [???] . the fruit was so plentiful that
young [???] very nearly bathed in [???] and cream ; and later they
sat on the lawns under the plum - trees and ate [???] until they had made piles of
stones like small pyramids or the heaped skulls of a conqueror [???] and then
they moved on . and no one was ill [???] and everyone was pleased . except those
who had to mow the grass .
in the [???] the vines were laden [???] and the yield of ' leaf ' was
astonishing ; and everywhere there was so much corn that at harvest every
barn was stuffed . ' the [???] barley was so fine that the beer of
[???] malt was long remembered and became a [???] . indeed a generation
later
one might hear an old [???] in an inn [???] aft er a good pint of well - earned
ale [???] put down his mug with a sigh : ' ah ! that was proper fourteen - twenty [???]
that was ! '
sam stayed at first at the cottons ' with [???] ; but when the new row
was ready he went with the [???] . in addition to all his other labours he
was busy directing the cleaning up and restoring of bag end ; but he was
often away in the shire on his forestry work . so he was not at home in early
march and did not know that [???] had been ill . on the [???] of that
month farmer cotton found [???] lying on his bed ; he was clutching a white
gem that hung on a chain about his neck and he seemed half in a dream .
' it is gone for ever [???] ' he said [???] ' and now all is dark and empty . '
but the fit passed [???] and when sam got back on the twenty - fifth [???] [???]
had recovered [???] and he said nothing about himself . in the meanwhile bag end
had been set in order [???] and merry and [???] came over from [???]
bringing back all the old furniture and gear [???] so that the old hole soon
looked very much as it always had done .
when all was at last ready [???] said : ' when are you going to move in
and join me [???] sam ? '
sam looked a bit [???] .
' there is no need to come yet [???] if you don ' t want to [???] ' said [???] . ' but
you k now the [???] is close at hand [???] and he will be very well looked after
by widow rumble . '
it s not that [???] mr . [???] [???] said sam [???] and he went ver red .
' well [???] what is it ? '
' it ' s rosie [???] rose cotton [???] ' said sam . ' it seems she didn ' t like my going

abroad at all [???] poor lass ; but as i hadn ' t spoken [???] she couldn ' t say so . and i
didn ' t speak [???] because i had a job to do first . but now i have spoken [???] and
she says : [???] well [???] you ' ve wasted a year [???] so why wait longer ? [???] [???] wasted ? [???] i
says . [???] i wouldn ' t call it that . [???] still i see what she means . i feel torn in
two [???] as you might say . '
' i see [???] ' said [???] : ' you want to get married [???] and yet you want to live
with me in bag end too ? but my dear sam [???] how easy ! get married as soon as
you can [???] and then move in with rosie . there ' s room enough in bag end for as
big a family as you could wish for . '
and so it was settled . sam [???] married rose cotton in the spring of
[???] ( which was also famous for its weddings ) [???] and they came and lived at
bag end . and if sam thought himself lucky [???] [???] knew that he was more
lucky
himself ; for there was not a hobbit in the shire that was looked after with
such care . when the labours of repair had all been planned and set going he
took to a quiet life [???] writing a great dea l and going through all his notes .
he resigned the office of deputy mayor at the free fair that mid - summer [???] and
dear old will whitfoot had another seven years of presiding at banquets .
merry and [???] lived together for some time at [???] [???] and there
was much coming and going between buckland and bag end . the two
young
travellers cut a great dash in the shire with their songs and their tales
and their finery [???] and their wonderful parties . ' lordly ' folk called them [???]
meaning nothing bu t good ; for it warmed all hearts to see them go riding by
with their mail - shirts so bright and their shields so [???] [???] laughing and
singing songs of far away ; and if they were now large and [???] [???] they
were unchanged otherwise [???] unless they were indeed more [???] and
more
jovial and full of merriment than ever before .
[???] and sam [???] however [???] went back to ordinary attire [???] except that when
there was need they both wore long grey cloaks [???] finely woven and clasped at
the throat with beautiful brooches ; and mr . [???] wore always a white jewel
on a chain that he often would finger .
all things now went well [???] with hope always of becoming still better ;
and sam was as busy and as full of delight as even a hobbit could wish .
nothing for him marred that whole year [???] except for some vague anxiety about
his master . [???] dropped quietly out of all the doings of the shire [???] and

sam was pained to notice how little honour he had in his own country . few
people knew or wanted to know about his deeds and adventures ; their
admiration and respect were given mostly to mr . [???] and mr . [???]
and ( if sam had known it ) to himself . also in the autumn there appeared a
shadow of old troubles .
one evening sam came into the study and found his master looking very
strange . he was very pale and his eyes seemed to see things far away .
' what ' s the matter [???] mr . [???] ? ' said sam .
' i am wounded [???] ' he answered [???] ' wounded ; it will never really heal . '
but then he got up [???] and the turn seemed to pass [???] and he was quite
himself the next day . it was not until afterwards that sam recalled that the
date was [???] the sixth . two years before on that day it was dark in the
dell under [???] .
time went on [???] and [???] came in . [???] was ill again in march [???] but with
a great effort he concealed it [???] for sam had other things to think about . the
first of sam and rosie ' s children was born on the twenty - fifth of march [???] a
date that sam noted .
' well [???] mr . [???] [???] ' he said . ' i ' m in a bit of a fix . rose and me had
settled to call him [???] [???] with your leave ; but it ' s not him [???] it ' s her .
though as pretty a [???] as any one could hope for [???] taking after rose
more than me [???] luckily . so we don ' t know what to do . '
' well [???] sam [???] ' said [???] [???] ' what ' s wrong with the old customs ? choose a
flower name like rose . half the [???] in the shire are called by such
names [???] and what could be better ? '
' i suppose you ' re right [???] mr . [???] [???] ' said sam . ' i ' ve heard some
beautiful names on my travels [???] but i suppose they ' re a bit too grand for
daily wear and tear [???] as you might say . the [???] [???] he says : [???] make it short [???]
and then you won ' t have to cut it short before you can use it . [???] but if it ' s
to be a flower - name [???] then i don ' t trouble about the length : it must be a
beautiful flower [???] because [???] you see [???] i think she is very beautiful [???] and is
going to be beautifuller still . '
[???] thought for a moment . ' well [???] sam [???] what about elanor [???] the
sun - star [???] you remember the little golden flower in the grass of [???] ? '
' you ' re right again [???] mr . [???] ! ' said sam delighted . ' that ' s what i
wanted . '
little elanor was nearly six months old [???] and [???] had passed to its
autumn [???] when [???] called sam into the study .

' it will be [???] ' s birthday on thursday [???] sam [???] ' he said . ' and he will
pass the old took . he will be a hundred and thirty - one ! '
' so he will ! ' said sam . ' he ' s a marvel ! '
' well [???] sam [???] ' said [???] . ' i want you to see rose and find out if she
can spare you [???] so that you and i can go off together . you can ' t go far or
for a long time now [???] of course [???] ' he said a little [???] .
' well [???] not very well [???] mr . [???] . '
' of course not . but never mind . you can see me on my way . tell rose
that you won ' t be away very long [???] not more than a fortnight ; and you ' ll come
back quite safe . '
' i wish i could go all the way with you to [???] [???] mr . [???] [???] and
see mr . [???] [???] ' said sam . ' and yet the only place i really want to be in is
here . i am that torn in two . '
' poor sam ! it will feel like that [???] i am afraid [???] ' said [???] . ' but you
will be healed . you were meant to be solid and whole [???] and you will be . '
in the next day or two [???] went through his papers and his writings
with sam [???] and he handed over his keys . there was a big book with plain red
leather covers ; its tall pages were now almost filled . at the beginning
there were many leaves covered with [???] ' s thin wandering hand ; but most of
it was written in [???] ' s firm flowing script . it was divided into chapters
but chapter 80 was [???] [???] and after that were some blank leaves . the
title page had many titles on it [???] crossed out one after another [???] so :

my diary . my unexpected journey . there and back again . and what
happened after .
adventures of five [???] . the tale of the great ring [???] compiled by
[???] [???] from his own observations and the accounts of his friends .
what we did in the war of the ring .
here [???] ' s hand ended and [???] had written :

the downfall
of the
lord of the rings
and the
return of the king

( as seen by the little people ; being the [???] of [???] and [???] of

the shire [???] [???] by the accounts of their friends and the learning of
the wise . )
together with [???] from books of lore translated by [???] in
[???] .
' why [???] you have nearly finished it [???] mr . [???] ! ' sam exclaimed . ' well [???]
you have kept at it [???] i must say . '
' i have quite finished [???] sam [???] ' said [???] . ' the last pages are for you . '
on [???] the twenty - first they set out together [???] [???] on the pony
that had borne him all the way from minas [???] [???] and was now called
strider ; and sam on his beloved bill . it was a fair golden morning [???] and sam
did not ask where they were going : he thought he could guess .
they took the stock road over the hills and went towards the woody end [???]
and they let their [???] walk at their leisure . they camped in the green
hills [???] and on [???] the twenty - second they rode gently down into the
beginning of the trees as afternoon was wearing away .
' if that isn ' t the very tree you hid behind when the black rider first
showed up [???] mr . [???] ! ' said sam pointing to the left . ' it seems like a dream
now . '
it was evening [???] and the stars were [???] in the eastern sky as
they passed the ruined oak and turned and went on down the hill between the
hazel - thickets . sam was silent [???] deep in his memories . presently he became
aware that [???] was singing softly to himself [???] singing the old
walking - song [???] but the words were not quite the same .
still round the corner there may wait
a new road or a secret gate ;
and though i oft have passed them by [???]
a day will come at last when i
shall take the hidden paths that run
west of the moon [???] east of the sun .
and as if in answer [???] from down below [???] coming up the road out of the
valley [???] voices sang :
a ! [???] [???] !
[???] penna [???]
o menel aglar [???] [???]
[???] [???] a ! [???] !
we still remember [???] we who dwell
in this far land beneath the trees

the starlight on the western seas .
[???] and sam halted and sat silent in the soft shadows [???] until they saw
a [???] as the travellers came towards them .
there was gildor and many fair elven folk ; and there to sam ' s wonder
rode [???] and [???] . [???] wore a mantle of grey and had a star upon
his forehead [???] and a silver harp was in his hand [???] and upon his finger was a
ring of gold with a great blue stone [???] [???] [???] mightiest of the three . but
[???] sat upon a white [???] and was robed all in [???] white [???]
like clouds about the moon ; for she herself seemed to shine with a soft
light . on her finger was [???] [???] the ring wrought of [???] [???] that bore a
single white stone [???] like a frosty star . riding slowly behind on a
small grey pony [???] and seeming to nod in his sleep [???] was [???] himself .
[???] greeted them gravely and graciously [???] and [???] smiled upon
them . ' well [???] master [???] [???] ' she said . ' i hear and see that you have used
my gift well . the shire shall now be more than ever blessed and beloved . '
sam bowed [???] but found nothing to say . he had forgotten how beautiful the lady
was .
then [???] woke up and opened his eyes . ' hullo [???] [???] ! ' he said . ' well [???]
i have passed the old took today ! so that ' s settled . and now i think i am
quite ready to go on another journey . are you coming ? '
' yes [???] i am coming [???] ' said [???] . ' the ring - bearers should go together . '
' where are you going [???] master ? ' cried sam [???] though at last he understood
what was happening .
' to the havens [???] sam [???] ' said [???] .
' and i can ' t come . '
' no [???] sam . not yet anyway [???] not further than the havens . though you too
were a ring - bearer [???] if only for a little while . your time may come . do not
be too sad [???] sam . you cannot be always torn in two . you will have to be one
and whole [???] for many years . you have so much to enjoy and to be [???] and to do . '
' but [???] ' said sam [???] and tears started in his eyes [???] ' i thought you were
going to enjoy the shire [???] too . for years and years [???] after all you have
done . '
' so i thought too [???] once . but i have been too deeply hurt [???] sam . i tried
to save the shire [???] and it has been saved [???] but not for me . it must often be
so [???] sam [???] when things are in danger : some one has to give them up [???] lose them [???]
so that others may keep them . but you are my heir : all that i had and might
have had i leave to you . and also you have rose [???] and elanor ; and [???] - lad

will come [???] and rosie - lass [???] and merry [???] and [???] [???] and [???] ; and
perhaps more that i cannot see . your hands and your wits will be needed
everywhere . you will be the mayor [???] of course [???] as long a s you want to be [???] and
the most famous gardener in history ; and you will read things out of the red
book [???] and keep alive the memory of the age that is gone . so that people will
remember the great danger and so love their beloved land all the more . and
that will keep you as busy and as happy as anyone can be [???] as long as your
part of the story goes on .
' come now [???] ride with me ! '
then [???] and [???] rode on ; for the third age was over [???] and the
days of the rings were passed [???] and an end was come of the story and song of
those times . with them went many elves of the high kindred who would
no
longer stay in middle - earth ; and among them [???] filled with a sadness that was
yet blessed and without bitterness [???] rode sam [???] and [???] [???] and [???] [???] and the
elves delighted to honour them .
though they rode through the midst of the shire all the evening and all
the night [???] none saw them pass [???] save the wild creatures ; or here and there
some wanderer in the dark who saw a swift [???] under the trees [???] or a
light and shadow flowing through the grass as the moon went westward . and
when they had passed from the shire [???] going about the south skirts of the
white downs [???] they came to the far downs [???] and to the towers [???] and looked on
the distant sea ; and so they rode down at last to [???] [???] to the grey
havens in the long firth of lune .
as they came to the gates [???] the [???] came forth to greet
them . very tall he was [???] and his beard was long [???] and he was grey and old [???]
save that his eyes were keen as stars ; and he looked at them and bowed [???] and
said : ' all is now ready . '
then [???] led them to the havens [???] and there was a white ship lying [???]
and upon the quay beside a great grey horse stood a figure robed all in
white [???] them . as he turned and came towards them [???] saw that
[???] now wore openly upon his hand the third ring [???] [???] the great [???] and
the stone upon it was red as fire . then those who were to go were glad [???] for
they knew that [???] also would take ship with them .
but sam was now sorrowful at heart [???] and it seemed to him that if the
parting would be bitter [???] more grievous still would be the long road home
alone . but even as they stood there [???] and the elves were going aboard [???] and

all was being made ready to depart [???] up rode merry and [???] in great haste .
and amid his tears [???] laughed .
' you tried to give us the slip once before and failed [???] [???] . ' he said .
' this time you have nearly succeeded [???] but you have failed again . it was not
sam [???] though [???] that gave you away this time [???] but [???] himself ! '
' yes [???] ' said [???] ; ' for it will be better to ride back three together
' than one alone . well [???] here at last [???] dear friends [???] on the shores of the sea
comes the end of our fellowship in middle - earth . go in peace ! i will not
say : do not weep ; for not all tears are an evil . '
then [???] kissed merry and [???] [???] and last of all sam [???] and went
aboard ; and the sails were drawn up [???] and the wind blew [???] and slowly the ship
slipped away down the long grey firth ; and the light of the glass of
[???] that [???] bore [???] and was lost . and the ship went out into
the high sea and passed on into the west [???] until at last on a night of rain
[???] smelled a sweet fragrance on the air and heard the sound of singing
that came over the water . and then it seemed to him that as in his dream in
the house of [???] [???] the grey rain - curtain turned all to silver glass and
was rolled back [???] and he beheld white shores and beyond them a far green
country under a swift [???] .
but to sam the evening deepened to darkness as he stood at the haven ;
and as he looked at the grey sea he saw only a shadow on the waters that was
soon lost in the west . there still he stood far into the night [???] hearing only
the sigh and murmur of the waves on the shores of middle - earth [???] and the
sound of them sank deep into his heart . beside him stood merry and [???] [???]
and they were silent .
at last the three companions turned away [???] and never again looking back
they rode slowly homewards ; and they spoke no word to one another until they
came back to the shire . but each had great comfort in his friends on the
long grey road .
at last they rode over the downs and took the east road [???] and then merry
and [???] rode on to buckland ; and already they were singing again as they
went . but sam turned to bywater [???] and so came back up the hill [???] as day was
ending once more . and he went on [???] and there was yellow light [???] and fire
within ; and the evening meal was ready [???] and he was expected . and rose drew
him in [???] and set him in his chair [???] and put little elanor upon his lap .
he drew a deep breath . ' well [???] i ' m back [???] ' he said .
